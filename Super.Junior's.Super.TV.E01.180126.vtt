38
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.930
It's really been a long time

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.770
Ah Heechul Hyung isn’t here yet either

43
00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.110

for the first shoot?

49
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.290
This is bad, we need to set rules

50
00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.950

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.370

House owner(?) Shindong emerges

55
00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.190
No, I just woke up

56
00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.230
Excessively red lips

57
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.130
Ah I'm even wearing my Pajamas

58
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.330
What will I do if you notice it

59
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.830
I didn't even wash my hair

60
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.360
Don't you think you applied too much lipstick?

61
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.360
- SD: No, my lips are originally red
- LT: Always?

62
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.730
Red lips because he heard the members were coming

63
00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.110
I welcome you to my house

64
00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.590
Did you guys try the massage chair?

65
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.630
It's not working though? I tried it earlier

66
00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.230
The cord isn’t plugged in that's why!

67
00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:00.830
You should plug the cord in first

68
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.430
But it's plugged in?

69
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:01.770
It's plugged in

70
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.010
Really?

71
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.930
There's no way this wouldn't work

72
00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.830
Then why?

73
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:04.450
It can't be

74
00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:05.410
Missing line from translation [Steph]

75
00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:06.790
Should I change it?

76
00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.200
This Hyung
can't do it

77
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.570
Hyung used this a lot, right?

78
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:10.010
Yeah

79
00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.810
No wonder the cushion is disappearing

80
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.610
Get lost

81
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.280
Get lost like the cushion too!

82
00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.350
You tried this before and said it was really good in the past

83
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.620
Distracted from the start

84
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.730
When I tried this before in your house it was a new world to me

85
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.410
A relationship where they fight using a massage chair

86
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.230
One person arrives while humming

87
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.930
You arrived~

88
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:25.850
Hey hurry up

89
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:26.890
Hey! Why are you so late!

90
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:27.730
You're really late!

91
00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:34.090
Hey what time is it? We waited 2 hours already! You really

92
00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.730
Why are they
like this to me

93
00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.630
Most stern in the world whilst receiving a massage

94
00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:35.790
There's no Boom microphone

95
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.460
Cries out for boom mic out of nowhere

96
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.630
Oh, you know the boom microphone because you’ve done some shows now?

97
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.520
Oh~ Lee Donghae has fully become an entertainer

98
00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.730
At last the six SUJU members have gathered

99
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.630
Oh~ Why does it only work on my left hand?

100
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.630
Is the part for the right hand broken?

101
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:48.910
It’s left handed

102
00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.910
I’m left handed~

103
00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.910
[T/N: - Song by Panic - Left Handed]

104
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.230
You arrived~

105
00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.490
Hey the dorm really became clean!

106
00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.590
Hyung… but… this... really... it's good

107
00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.710
Perfect new world

108
00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.710
Whether the Hyungs come or not, I'm a massage-holic

109
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:00.890
I told you it's really good

110
00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.270
Oh, I remember when we used to live here

111
00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.920
It's been a long time to visit the dorm

112
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.570
Is this where we lived?

113
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.930
No, me, Kyuhyun and

114
00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:07.850
Ryeowook

115
00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.670
Ryeowook. We lived here and moved up

116
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.950
You lived here too and left saying you’ll get married

117
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.470
No! That wasn’t that time

118
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.730
Flustered

119
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.470
Oh!! Hyung! Oh!! This-

120
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.130
My butt! Hyung!

121
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.470
Hey stop that

122
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.150
I wanna try it once

123
00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.370
Hyung!

124
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.530
Like a black hole,

125
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.530
The chair massager is full of charms~

126
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.070
I know, I know

127
00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:26.610
Hey Yesung come here! Quickly!

128
00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.750
We don’t have time for this, we need to move on

129
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.630
Distracted-Junior is here as well today...

130
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.530
Hey! Let's start by ordering food first!

131
00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.380
For now, order food first!

132
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.270
There's some strawberries in there

133
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.990
Go wash some Strawberries

134
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.450
I’m having Deja Vu

135
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:36.860
This seems familiar...

136
00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.890
Hey

137
00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.890
At the time of the first shoot

138
00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.950
Yo yo yo yo!

139
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:40.890
Let's order food first

140
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.910
No, let's order food first!

141
00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.060
As soon as he arrives

142
00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.060
Food-seeking Dong-crates

143
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.350
I'll order what I want

144
00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.550
Yes Hyung order what you want

145
00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.150
First of all, let's order food

146
00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.800
As usual today with the food talk

147
00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.970
Hey, when Yesung comes will he cry again?

148
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.310
I'm… with the members…

149
00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.810
I did activities alone right?

150
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.030
On the first day when gathered to shoot

151
00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.090
I kept experiencing both disappointment and happiness

152
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.090
Working alone without the members

153
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.090
I remember the days

154
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.970
When we're together I want us to be each other's comfort

155
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.490
Sob

156
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.490
sob

157
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.650
Become successful

158
00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.050
Hey Donghae, you come here too

159
00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.850
Hey why are your lips so red?

160
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.830
No, they're always like this!

161
00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.630
Feigns ignorance

162
00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:18.910
You're like someone from Itaewon

163
00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.430
Meanwhile the members got sidetracked again

164
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.390
Forget that

165
00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:24.130
Being in the dorm while wearing makeup is really weird

166
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.750
This kind of broadcast is really fake

167
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.730
-  SD: Hey, let's remove it
- EH: Let’s wipe it off and come back

168
00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.590
Why is your hair like that when we're in the dorm?

169
00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.900
hour hand snap

170
00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.670
I'm like this. I woke up like this

171
00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:33.610
But seriously...

172
00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.910
Been standing for awhile
holding the strawberries

173
00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:34.710
Hey what will we do with the strawberry?

174
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:35.410
Are we really going to eat this?

175
00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:36.330
Yes.

176
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.910
Really gonna eat it?

177
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.890
Instead of shooting, go wash strawberries...

178
00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:37.550
Go wash it

179
00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.890
LT: So,

180
00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.410
Hey, hey! One person is having a massage, one is washing strawberries

181
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.750
It’s a surprise the audio director hasn’t quit already

182
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.790
I think the number of staff has decreased though?

183
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.310
Ah~

184
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.010
What are you doing?

185
00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.530
Ah it really hurts

186
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.990
What is this mess?

187
00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.120
6 split screens

188
00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.960
What is this?

189
00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.010
What I'm sure is this is messier than the Knowing Brothers classroom

190
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.010
That's for sure

191
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.650
You guys are the best at being distracting

192
00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:03.070
Anyway hey

193
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.010
So, this time we're doing Super TV right?

194
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.510
We're the front runners of XtvN

195
00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:10.330
XtvN's forefront entertainment

196
00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:09.690
That’s right

197
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.550
They said it back then.

198
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.030
It's a little burdensome...

199
00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:12.650
This is going to be that big?

200
00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.590
We're not the only ones that think that, right?

201
00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.270
The airing time isn’t decided yet

202
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.880
We can say what time we prefer to air

203
00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.220
It's important

204
00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:21.890
Here’s the schedule

205
00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.010
I heard XtvN targets viewers in their 10s-30s

206
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.790
That's very important

207
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.090
The last time that we met with the PDs,

208
00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.830
They said that the best time would be 8pm to 12am

209
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.750
On Friday they have a Super Model contest!

210
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:38.830
At 6pm

211
00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.840
That's just for that day

212
00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:40.800
What about it?

213
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.600
They won't do it every week

214
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.610
Dec. 15 will be our first airing!

215
00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:45.970
That's the day of airing?

216
00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.980
Is that what's written?

217
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.510
Something feels odd?

218
00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:49.090
Nope

219
00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:49.980
If it's Dec 15...

220
00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.010
Then it already passed!

221
00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.250
What is this?

222
00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:53.620
When did it pass?

223
00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.630
On the day of shooting

224
00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.630
Already New Year's Eve

225
00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.150
Let's check tvN's schedule

226
00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.810
We're aiming for 10s and 20s right?

227
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.320
Then we can't overlap with Music Bank

228
00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.250
Right

229
00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.090
This is tvN's Line

230
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.090
There’s 'The Dictionary of Useful Knowledge'

231
00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:09.050
It's not 'useful' it's 'useless'!

232
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.650
'The Dictionary of Useless Knowledge' is really good!

233
00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.030
We should watch that

234
00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.030
After 'The Dictionary of Useless Knowledge'

235
00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:15.850
After that?

236
00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:18.470
It must be Youn's Kitchen

237
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.950
We should be in front of the well-doing show

238
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.620
Viewer ratings tip!

239
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.620
.                                      .
.                                      .

240
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.620
When put in front a good program,

241
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.620
you'll receive good ratings

242
00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.490
- LT: Right
- SD: You know?

243
00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:26.850
I think 10pm would be a really good spot

244
00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:29.280
After Youn's Kitchen?

245
00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.220
Yesung chose a very late time-slot

246
00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:32.270
Then we're the same time as Youn's Kitchen?

247
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:33.290
After it

248
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:34.410
Let's do it at the same time!

249
00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.120
At the same time?

250
00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:38.270
That way if this doesn’t work out we at least have an excuse

251
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:42.070
The important thing is XtvN and tvN are simultaneous

252
00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.620
Ah really?

253
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:45.710
I think if we go after that, we overlap with ‘Law of the Jungle’

254
00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.000
Not an easy time-slot

255
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:46.510
We should be before them

256
00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:48.770
8pm would be nice

257
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:54.790
Because when people turn the TV on for Youn’s Kitchen, some will be on this channel

258
00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:55.860
Viewer ratings tip!

259
00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:55.860
.                                      .
.                                      .

260
00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:55.860
<Youn's Restaurant> If you put it before,

261
00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:55.860
you can get a high viewership rate

262
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:55.830
That’s right

263
00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:58.250
While changing channels

264
00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:59.650
Where is Youn's kitchen airing?

265
00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:00.870
tvN

266
00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:01.750
How many times have we said?!

267
00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:02.630
So we...

268
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.690
Did not

269
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.690
Understand

270
00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:04.850
We're on XtvN

271
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:06.850
Ah! My head hurts!

272
00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:07.100
Goodness Eunhyuk-ah...

273
00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:08.850
Let's not do the show!

274
00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:09.830
Frustrated

275
00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:10.090
****** HEY!

276
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.730
Hyung! You can't say that!

277
00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:12.410
Shower of affection

278
00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.740
No cursing~

279
00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.410
So we'll stick to Youn's Kitchen?

280
00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:18.700
Yes

281
00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:19.230
Ah~

282
00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:20.170
Then let’s do this

283
00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:22.700
If we convince Youn's Kitchen nicely,

284
00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:26.710
They'll do Youn's kitchen in 2 parts and we'll be in the middle!

285
00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.090
It sounds good?

286
00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:32.750
When Youn's kitchen is doing commercial our show can be broadcasted

287
00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:35.530
You're close with Seojin Hyung, right?

288
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:36.750
Me?

289
00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:37.890
Ah Seojin Hyung?

290
00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:39.360
Seojin Hyung is in Youn's kitchen?

291
00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.370
Yes~ This kid doesn't know anything

292
00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:41.840
How is he like this...

293
00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.090
Who appears on Youn's Kitchen?

294
00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:44.190
Lee Soogeun!

295
00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.730
Why is Hyung like this too?

296
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:46.710
He's not there

297
00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:47.990
Oh, is that Kang's Kitchen?

298
00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:49.710
Jung Yumi’s on it right?

299
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.300
These people really

300
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.300
Is it okay to calmly discuss it like this...

301
00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:51.010
Right

302
00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:54.270
Someone close to Na PD should ask the favor

303
00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:55.930
Oh hey!

304
00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:56.730
Ah right!

305
00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:58.650
Na PD chose you

306
00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:00.170
He's wasn’t there right?

307
00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:02.180
He wants to work with you

308
00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:03.610
Donghae chosen by Na PD

309
00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:03.610
What was the reason?

310
00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:03.590
He said he wants to meet you

311
00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:11.290
If you were to make a new program, amongst us 5, who would you chose?

312
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:07.350
At the time of PPT presentation

313
00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:13.660
I like Donghae

314
00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:15.990
Ah, he’s not here today

315
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:20.060
I watched Knowing Brothers and Donghae was really funny

316
00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:24.100
I want to meet him but he's not here today

317
00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:24.020
I was waiting for Donghae in my heart

318
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:26.910
He wants to work with you

319
00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:28.290
That's how Na Youngseok PD

320
00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:28.290
picked Donghae

321
00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:28.410
He said he wants to meet you

322
00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:29.610
He wants to work with you

323
00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:31.140
He said he wants to meet you

324
00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:32.190
Should I do variety shows?

325
00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:35.140
You're doing one right now!

326
00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:39.150
But it doesn’t seem like you’re adjusting well to it right now?

327
00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:37.610
Passionately eating salad

328
00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:41.190
Do I even need to get adjusted to this?

329
00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:43.600
What is he?

330
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:47.950
With Donghae, when we did SJ Returns, his awkwardness was natural

331
00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:49.990
Now he’s felt that

332
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:51.990
He’s trying to act natural while eating

333
00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:52.460
Swayed by the taste (?) of an awkward character, Donghae

334
00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:54.000
I think he's trying to express that

335
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.530
He’s eating in order to get attention his way

336
00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:00.470
Actually Donghae is like...

337
00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:02.610
This camera is fascinating

338
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.020
Unfamiliar with cameras even as a 13-year old celebrity

339
00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:04.610
I can't do something like this

340
00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:08.740
In front of numerous cameras

341
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.740
UNEASY

342
00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:10.110
You still can't look at the camera?

343
00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:12.340
Donghae has a phobia being in front of camera

344
00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:11.610
Why should I look at the camera?

345
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:12.710
The camera should be looking at me

346
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:16.020
I'm making eye contact with the camera

347
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:15.940
From some point

348
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:15.940
eye contact with camera

349
00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:19.450
I'm bored now so I’m here with Donghae camera

350
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:19.450
Launched DonghaeTV without being told to do it

351
00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:21.790
I shouldn't be in front of the camera too much

352
00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:22.350
In the end, Donghae...

353
00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:24.990
But strangely it doesn’t feel unfamiliar

354
00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:25.720
After 13 years, he became bff's (?) with the camera

355
00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:28.450
I think he knows what he's doing

356
00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.340
I'll try hard~

357
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:32.700
As we said before, this won’t be a season

358
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:32.460
Going back to the point again

359
00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:34.700
We’re going to be a regular show

360
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:35.810
Formally organize Super TV

361
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.440
Everyone, stop pretending like you’re hearing this stuff for the first time

362
00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:40.010
I heard it's 4 episodes?

363
00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:41.330
No

364
00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:42.010
We asked this

365
00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:47.070
When starting a show how many episodes will it take to see the predicted results?

366
00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:50.380
[T/N: They're using internet slang Japanese words]

367
00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:48.380
Ah not that word

368
00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:49.270
Outline?

369
00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:50.380
To see an outline

370
00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:50.890
Hey!

371
00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:53.130
This isn’t an internet broadcast!

372
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:54.390
Losing face

373
00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:56.390
What do you think you're doing?!

374
00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:57.290
Sorry

375
00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:58.390
Sorry (in Japanese)

376
00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:00.830
For using vocabulary slanders, we apologize~

377
00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:03.170
Usually its 4 episodes,

378
00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:07.540
If the 4 episodes do well, then they go up to 8 or 12 episodes

379
00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.050
We don't have that

380
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.810
Super TV is set to be a regular show already

381
00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:10.810
We’re going for a regular show

382
00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:13.130
When our Shinhwa Hyungs did ‘Shinhwa Broadcast’ it lasted for 3 years

383
00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.530
- HC: The show did really well so they added more episodes
- SD: It was the best

384
00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:17.810
Shinhwa Broadcast (2012~2014)

385
00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:17.810
.                                          .
.                                          .
.                                          .

386
00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:17.810
Korea’s longest running idol group Shinhwa
A variety programme with 6 members
called Shinhwa Broadcast. Went up
to a whopping number of 70 episodes

387
00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:17.360
- LT: There was like 60 episodes
- YS: 70

388
00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.960
As far as I know, other than the Shinhwa Hyungs,

389
00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:24.360
- SD: There hasn’t been programmes with full groups together
- HC: There’s not been any successful ones

390
00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.130
If you look here, idols-

391
00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:26.890
Looking at variety shows idols have done in recent years

392
00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:29.330
I.O.I’s Cable Friends, WJSN’s Would You Like Girls

393
00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:30.730
I liked 'Would You Like Girls'

394
00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:32.590
Twice’s Elegant Private Life

395
00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:33.960
I really like watching that too!

396
00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:35.290
Hyung, you’ve seen them all?!

397
00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:36.160
When I was in the army

398
00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.960
I’ve seen them too, at least one episode

399
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:38.070
More

400
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:38.070
and more

401
00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.830
Wow, there’s really a lot of shows

402
00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:40.170
Though there are many idol variety shows

403
00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:42.160
But 'Shinhwa Broadcast' was the biggest

404
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:42.440
The real top of idol variety was [Shinhwa Broadcast]

405
00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.630
All the others are just reality shows

406
00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:45.530
You’re right, pretty much

407
00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:49.530
I think it will be hard to predict what we should do to make a variety show do well lately

408
00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:50.890
Because there’s so many different genres

409
00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:53.550
Due to there being many genres

410
00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:53.550
And the viewers' tastes being different too

411
00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:51.830
That’s right

412
00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:53.860
There’s going on trips, eating broadcasts

413
00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:55.590
What’s our genre?

414
00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:57.730
We did a presentation remember!

415
00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:01.530
Super Junior’s own variety format!

416
00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:01.120
Super Junior’s own variety format!

417
00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:07.590
Reality, food, quiz, talk show, audition programmes

418
00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:07.330
Variety is

419
00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:07.330
Reality,

420
00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:07.330
Food show,

421
00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:07.330
Quiz show,

422
00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.330
Talk show,

423
00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:07.330
Auditions etc.

424
00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:09.630
Variety formats of many different genres

425
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:09.690
There are many formats

426
00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:16.130
Super Junior will meet all and create something new

427
00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:11.930
Meeting with Super Junior

428
00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:15.770
They get changed into a different new format

429
00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:17.590
We talked about it then

430
00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:21.290
We did but... I would like it if we didn’t do it like that

431
00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:21.960
Really?

432
00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:23.710
Suddenly?

433
00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:22.530
Yeah

434
00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:23.990
Then, tell us your thoughts

435
00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:27.930
Because no matter what, you can never be better than the original

436
00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:28.590
With anything

437
00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:31.460
No, they say imitation is the mother of creation

438
00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:33.390
[T/N: Heechul said the correct expression but changed the order a bit so they’re confused]

439
00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:33.850
The mother of creation is imitation…

440
00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:32.330
Correct

441
00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:33.990
That’s an expression

442
00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:36.660
Is it: ‘The mother of imitation is creation’?

443
00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:36.160
The mother
of imitation?

444
00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:36.160
The mother
of creation?

445
00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:38.030
It seems a bit different?

446
00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:38.390
Something is weird?

447
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:40.430
The mother of creation is imitation

448
00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:42.130
Is that not it?

449
00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:41.830
Changjo is from Teen Top

450
00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:41.830
[T/N: The word for 'creation' in Korean is Changjo]

451
00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.130
Changjo is from Teen Top though

452
00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.530
No, it’s Shinhwa’s Changjo!

453
00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:46.300
Changjo is Shinhwa’s Changjo of course!

454
00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.400
What is he haha

455
00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:48.860
Are you still eating?

456
00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:50.940
This guy is just a viewer in his living room

457
00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:50.290
Are you a rabbit?

458
00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:52.790
Isn’t it: ‘The mother of imitation is creation’?

459
00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:54.510
The debate about the mother of imitation that gets more controversial the more they speak

460
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:55.360
No, it’s: ‘imitation is the mother of creation’

461
00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.730
We’re like idiots

462
00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:57.610
We’re like total idiots

463
00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:00.590
If a new variety meets with Suju,

464
00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:01.820
Leeteuk who explains about the format once again

465
00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:04.330
It won’t be that we’d change anything but that a new format of variety will be born

466
00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:04.450
Wistful

467
00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:06.430
So it’s just gonna be like taking a hit at this and that?

468
00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:07.690
So anyhow Super TV will be

469
00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:07.690
Using the style of taking a hit at whatever?

470
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:08.430
Exactly! So, we-

471
00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:09.690
Like this

472
00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:13.230
This Hyung is weird

473
00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:12.460
Give me a reaction, let’s act close

474
00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:13.230
Give me a reaction

475
00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:13.330
Let’s do that!

476
00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:14.760
Like the show “Dad! Where are you going?”

477
00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:15.630
For example

478
00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:15.630
Like [Dad! Where are you going?]

479
00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:17.760
Let’s send off just our dad’s on a trip for real

480
00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:18.330
Sending only our dads on vacation

481
00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:19.360
And we watch

482
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:21.940
Super Junior’s

483
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:21.940
[Where did our dads go for real?]

484
00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:21.460
That doesn’t sound bad

485
00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:22.460
I like that

486
00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.230
And in “Super Junior Brothers”

487
00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:25.610
Using the format of [Knowing Brothers]

488
00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:28.430
Using Donghae’s real Hyung, we can make a show just with older brothers

489
00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:28.510
With Donghae’s big bro, a variety using only real big brothers

490
00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:29.130
Knowing Bro

491
00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:32.650
Super Junior’s

492
00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:32.650
[A brother we know for real]??

493
00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:30.490
A real knowing brother

494
00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:33.090
Having actual brothers we know?

495
00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:35.080
Using the format of [Life Bar]

496
00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:37.430
Using “A Life Bar” we can go to bars that we like to go to usually

497
00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:38.050
Filming at bars we each frequent

498
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:38.090
Sounds good

499
00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:39.260
We can do it all

500
00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:40.750
Putting all the variety formats together to use is Super TV

501
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:40.230
They’re good ideas

502
00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.690
What is the blue box for?

503
00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:47.390
For Suju’s own variety format

504
00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:44.890
Can I just pick?

505
00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:46.060
It’s already decided?

506
00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.390
A picking box

507
00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:47.490
Who got it right?

508
00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:48.290
Food show

509
00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.360
Food show!

510
00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:50.590
Quiz show

511
00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:51.470
Quiz!

512
00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:52.360
Movie?

513
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.700
Movie!

514
00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:53.990
Nobody wrote that down though?

515
00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:55.460
Do we just go as we speak?

516
00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:58.090
You’ve made this into too big of a deal!

517
00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:01.740
Aaaaaaah!!!

518
00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:03.190
Donghae

519
00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:06.750
SUJU

520
00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:06.590
Then the people coming today-

521
00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:06.750
Dizzy

522
00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:08.590
I can’t do this!

523
00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:08.720
I can’t do it if it’s like this!

524
00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:10.960
If you act like this I will also become a gangster!

525
00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:12.120
If you be like this I will also become a gangster!!

526
00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:12.390
I can’t hold back!

527
00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:12.990
Really?

528
00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:14.660
Dumb

529
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:14.660
Founded

530
00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:16.530
Get some clothes at least!

531
00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:18.890
Something that made Suju so shocked

532
00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:18.890
The secret of the picking box?

533
00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:17.430
This is amazing

534
00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.190
It would be fun if it was like that

535
00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:21.430
Yeah, it’d be like that

536
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:22.660
Then

537
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:22.660
Deal!

538
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:22.860
Okay then, let’s do it like that

539
00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.130
Suddenly changed

540
00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:25.200
What’s up
with him lol

541
00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:25.430
We said this when doing the ppt

542
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:26.430
Crazy Variety

543
00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:29.040
That’s how the idol crazy variety was created

544
00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:31.730
[T/N: ‘Dol’ is a part of the words ‘Idol’, ‘Crazy’ and ‘Turn’ in Korean]

545
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:31.790
It has the meaning of crazies as well but also the format will keep turning and changing

546
00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:33.740
It’s a word that includes changing up the format

547
00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:34.060
Idol plus crazy

548
00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:36.130
So, first Eunhyuk will go into ice water

549
00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:38.030
That’s right! You said you’d go into ice water!

550
00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:38.210
Right!

551
00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:39.260
No, no, no

552
00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:40.180
Flustered

553
00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:40.730
You have to do it, it was a promise!

554
00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:43.930
In my opinion, you have to do something to get attention

555
00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:43.480
After the presentation for Super TV

556
00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:47.490
Like going into ice water or running into the sea

557
00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:51.530
Like going into ice water or running into the sea

558
00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.030
Shock

559
00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:52.830
I recommend going into ice water

560
00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:54.900
As a resolution

561
00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:54.900
Kim Yoogeon CP that
recommends Ice Water

562
00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:54.730
Why do you like ice water so much?!

563
00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:57.590
Ice water normally leaves a big impression

564
00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:02.490
The viewers can see that you have a resolution

565
00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:01.870
Making jokes about ice water with such a serious face

566
00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:05.460
We see, can- can show a resolution to that extent

567
00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:05.740
Eunhyuk who is falling for it

568
00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:10.330
But, why did Kim Yoogon PD keep on saying that?!

569
00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:10.110
Why is Kim Yoogeon CP like that

570
00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:12.930
Literally all he talked about was ice water

571
00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:12.680
Wants to cry just thinking about it

572
00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:14.820
Ice Water
would be fun lol

573
00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:14.930
Yeah, you have to go into ice water

574
00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:16.760
Then firstly,

575
00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:19.390
I think we all have to know our individual characters first

576
00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:20.350
I think we should know our characters!

577
00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:20.360
We should know our characters

578
00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.360
You have to know yourself to succeed

579
00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:23.690
If you know your enemies and yourself, you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles

580
00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.290
When we gathered last time, we talked about this

581
00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:31.190
- SD: Our popularity, likability and recognition, stuff like that
- LT: That was the most fun

582
00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:33.790
Number one in likability right now is probably Heechul Hyung

583
00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:33.930
Before preparing the album

584
00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:33.930
The members that did a self-analysis of their likability

585
00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:35.860
Nobody even knows you

586
00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:37.000
The warm(?) fact attacks coming and going

587
00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:37.390
That’s why there’s no comparison

588
00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:38.930
I think Yesung is 4th

589
00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:40.170
And the unstoppable evaluations

590
00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:41.790
I’m 5th, you’re 6th

591
00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:43.240
It was a self-analysis that only left them with scars

592
00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.650
Let’s do an analysis of variety skills!

593
00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.890
This time too, let’s do variety sense,

594
00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:47.360
Who does best in Variety shows

595
00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:48.750
That’s a
good idea

596
00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.330
What we’re best at

597
00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:49.660
We should know this stuff

598
00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:53.530
Because this is a variety show, let’s do

599
00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:53.220
What are virtues for entertainers?

600
00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:57.020
Being funny

601
00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:56.890
How funny, hosting ability, reactions

602
00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:57.020
Hosting

603
00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:57.020
Reactions

604
00:14:56.890 --> 00:14:57.860
Like a pentagram!

605
00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:00.630
Let’s make a variety skills pentagram!

606
00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:59.130
Let’s make a pentagram

607
00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:00.590
Let’s pick 5 things

608
00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:03.390
I’ll do the writing

609
00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.930
The first virtue: Hosting ability

610
00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:05.230
Hosting

611
00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:05.960
Adlibs

612
00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.230
It should be quick wits

613
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:08.470
The second virtue: Quick wits

614
00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:08.490
Quick Wits

615
00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:10.030
Reactions

616
00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.740
The third virtue: Reactions

617
00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:11.730
Stamina

618
00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:13.370
The fourth virtue: Stamina

619
00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:13.060
Stamina is important

620
00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:14.860
What’s one other thing we could do?

621
00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:15.790
Just do looks

622
00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:18.290
How are we supposed to look (for variety)?

623
00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:19.880
What is the appearance supposed to be like?

624
00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:19.880
Like you

625
00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:19.460
Like you

626
00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:22.720
Looks that are full of variety skill?

627
00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.890
What else is important for variety?

628
00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:27.560
[T/N: Basically being the butt of jokes/receiving jokes well]

629
00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:27.630
That thing! Being a sandbag

630
00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:28.630
Receiving

631
00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:29.890
Number 5

632
00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:29.890
Receiving jokes with a sandbag action

633
00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:30.060
Sandbag

634
00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:31.090
What would you call that?

635
00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:32.360
The sandbag role?

636
00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:33.090
Receiving

637
00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:34.530
It’s the sandbag role!

638
00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:35.930
So you’re just gonna write sandbag?

639
00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:37.890
It looks a bit weird

640
00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:39.170
Sandbag sound a bit lame…

641
00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:39.160
Being a receiver?

642
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:41.160
We have to have a Kim Youngchul role!

643
00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:41.970
Kim Youngchul role from [Knowing Bros]

644
00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:41.930
Indeed

645
00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:43.930
Then I’m just gonna write Kim Youngchul

646
00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:46.040
Whatever

647
00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:46.040
I’m just writing Kim Youngchul!

648
00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:46.040
Actually wrote it

649
00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:47.790
Youngchul Hyung is amazing

650
00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:49.960
Youngchul became a part of the important pentagram!

651
00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.040
Amongst the pentagram

652
00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.040
He takes up a corner~

653
00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:51.060
I’ll write Youngchul role

654
00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:52.680
The fifth virtue: Youngchul role

655

Youngchul role

661
00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:03.030
So we don’t need special talents anymore?

662
00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:04.630
That’s a part of quick wits

663
00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:05.690
Oh so it goes into that?

664
00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:07.730
Talents are included in Quick Wits

665
00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:08.190
- LT: Special talents is included into having quick wits
- HC: Okay this is Leeteuk’s page

666
00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:09.130
Leeteuk’s?

667
00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.600
First member to be analysed

Leeteuk

670
00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:11.860
Are they all out of 5?

671
00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:13.590
Hosting is 5 points of course

672
00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:15.440
Unanimous

673
00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:15.440
As expected of a hosting-holic, 5 points for Hosting

674
00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:15.890
5 points for hosting

675
00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:17.590
Quick wits is a little lower right?

676
00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:19.160
Honestly it’s lower

677
00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.010
Haaa

678
00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.090
He’s not that quick witted

679
00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:21.890
It’s much lower

680
00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:23.290
How many points will you give me?

681
00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.460
One point

682
00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:27.350
One Point

683
00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:27.350
One Point

684
00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:25.130
One point?

685
00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:26.960
One is too low!

686
00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:27.350
Flustered

687
00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:28.790
It should be at least 3 points

688
00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:28.230
Should be 3 points…

689
00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:29.820
Decided

690
00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:29.890
No, his reactions are good

691
00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:31.090
Let’s hear from the other members

692
00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:32.230
Give me 3 points

693
00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:34.560
In the variety baby’s eyes

694
00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:34.560
The leader’s quick wits ranking is?

695
00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:37.690
Other than hosting, he’s not very quick witted

696
00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:41.600
Acknowledging the variety baby’s fact attack!

697
00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:40.030
Okay, I’ll acknowledge that

698
00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:40.960
His reactions are good

699
00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:41.690
Reactions are good

700
00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:43.890
Reactions should be 4 points?

701
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:45.170
Reaction is unanimously 4 points??

702
00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:45.360
Since he was on Star King

703
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:47.900
Was MC with him at some point

704
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:47.900
Eunhyuk who has something to say

705
00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:48.260
But his reactions are also like-

706
00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:49.660
They push people away right?

707
00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:51.490
No it’s not that

708
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.570
Dizzy

709
00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:52.930
His reactions depend on his mood

710
00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:55.210
It differs depending on Hyung’s mood

711
00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:54.890
Then 3 points

712
00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:55.210
Minus 1 point

713
00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:55.210
Then 3 points

714
00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:56.590
It’s going so low

715
00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:57.910
Dizzy at the fact attacks he didn’t expect

716
00:16:57.130 --> 00:16:57.830
Stamina

717
00:16:58.130 --> 00:16:59.560
Honestly I don’t think his stamina is good

718
00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:00.690
My variety stamina is good!

719
00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:01.960
His variety stamina is really good!

720
00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:04.060
That’s only when the camera is there

721
00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:06.390
Then 4 points? 5?

722
00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:06.550
Then 4 points? 5 points?

723
00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:10.230
Concentration also fits into stamina and his is really good so 5 points, he's the best

724
00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:09.720
Concentration is included in stamina so 5 points

725
00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:12.260
He’s not good at the receiving sandbag role

726
00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:12.590
Lastly the Youngchul role?

727
00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:13.930
No wait, he is good

728
00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:15.030
He’s good at the Youngchul role too though?

729
00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:14.790
He’s good

730
00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:16.890
He guides the sandbag

731
00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:18.030
To get hit

732
00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:19.330
Why does he have so many 5's?

733
00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:21.060
But he doesn’t receive well

734
00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:22.670
He can’t throw back

735
00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:22.930
That’s right

736
00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:23.960
3 points!

737
00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.530
After receiving a joke I should pass it on but I don’t do that well?

738
00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:27.130
It’s like this

739
00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:28.090
This isn’t so bad

740
00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:29.880
Self

741
00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:29.880
Satisfied

742
00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:30.790
It’s good, he’s definitely a good person for variety

743
00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:32.330
The shape has formed

744
00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:34.450
What kind of shape will Leeteuk’s be?

745
00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:34.090
Oh, it’s like a diamond!

746
00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:35.260
This is Leeteuk’s

747
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:36.560
It’s like a Sapphire

748
00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:37.890
It’s good

749
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:40.830
Hello Aunties~

750
00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:42.830
Please take care of us~

751
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:44.990
Please make it tasty~

752
00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:47.230
You need to rub it well

753
00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:49.430
The Laver, rice and meat

754
00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:53.260
The carbohydrates, proteins and seaweed

755
00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:52.670
Who is this Hyung…

756
00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:55.660
Can’t I just stand here like this?

757
00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:56.730
Hyung that’s a hosting disease

758
00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:57.490
I know, right?

759
00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:01.030
Indeed, it’s a trend of newer hosting in our country

760
00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:02.360
Hyung, you’re hosting too much

761
00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:04.590
There’s no emotion in his tone!

762
00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:06.660
I’m leaving today everyone

763
00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:07.890
Hosting even when alone

764
00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:09.590
I will leave to find the lost me

765
00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:10.720
Hosting-holic that doesn’t get tired Leeteuk

766
00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:12.430
Now it’s me

767
00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:14.020
Second member to be analysed

768
00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:14.020
Entertainment trend Heechul

769
00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:14.430
I’m anxious

770
00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:15.660
Quick wits, 5 points

771
00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:17.730
Yeah 5 points for quick wits

772
00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:17.960
Agreed

773
00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:20.130
Truthfully, I can’t host

774
00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:20.630
Admits himself

775
00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:20.630
I can’t host…

776
00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.090
2 points, it’s around 2 points

777
00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:25.030
Firstly, you don’t really like hosting

778
00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:25.790
Yeah I don’t exactly like it

779
00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:28.790
But if a girl group is around, Heechul hosts well

780
00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:29.570
Explosive hosting skills if there’s a girl group

781
00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:29.290
Then 4 points

782
00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:30.890
If it’s a boy group then it’s 1 point

783
00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:32.640
Unbalanced with groups hosting skill 3 points

784
00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:32.230
No, 0 points

785
00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:32.930
3 points, then

786
00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:33.460
Reactions

787
00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:35.040
The third virtue: Reactions

788
00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:35.160
I’m not that great with reactions

789
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:36.830
He needs a female around

790
00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:37.910
Sorry boy groups

791
00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:37.910
Indeed he just needs a girl group

792
00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:38.030
If a boy group comes

793
00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:39.490
2 points

794
00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:40.830
2 points is a lot

795
00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:44.360
Since it’s 5 for girl groups and 1 for boy groups, then 3?

796
00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.130
It’s too different with both so 2 points

797
00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:46.760
2?

798
00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:47.390
Yeah 2

799
00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:49.630
You’re getting greedy right now, aren’t you?

800
00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:51.990
Weirdly greedy for reactions

801
00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:51.790
You want a big pentagram, don’t you?

802
00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:53.890
But his stamina is also a game of luck!

803
00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:56.360
No, for stamina, I’m 0

804
00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:57.160
Admits himself

805
00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:57.160
Stamina is 0

806
00:18:57.130 --> 00:18:58.790
I can’t go outdoors

807
00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:00.890
He can’t go outdoors and he’s bad at long shootings

808
00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:01.760
Then 1

809
00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:03.090
There’s no 0 right?

810
00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.610
Lowest 1 point, Highest 5 points

811
00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:05.090
We’re only doing one to five

812
00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:07.210
Heechul Stamina 1

813
00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:06.430
We don’t have 0 so 1

814
00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:08.860
Now it’s the Kim Youngchul role

815
00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:10.740
Lastly the Youngchul role

816
00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:10.890
I can’t do this well

817
00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:12.590
Heechul is always throwing out jokes,

818
00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:13.290
I can’t get hit

819
00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:15.690
But because he’s so strong with throwing them out,

820
00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:17.460
Other people can’t receive his jokes

821
00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:18.260
That’s right

822
00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:18.930

0 points

824
00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:20.430
0?

825
00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:21.490
Jokes

826
00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:21.590
Let’s do 1

827
00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:27.890
Then, Hyung, you only specialize in quick wits!

828
00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:28.860
I can’t live

829
00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:30.690
Hyung, you got this far using only your quick wits?!

830
00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:31.930
Heechulie Hyung respect

831
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:32.190
You’re amazing Hyung!

832
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:34.590
‘I’m meeting my friends so I’m shy shy shy!”

833
00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:34.500
Full tank of excitement (?)

834
00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:36.390
It’s the programme’s first guest

835
00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:38.560
Does it have to be a man?

836
00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:41.580
It won’t be…   It won’t be…

837
00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:43.560
Oh, will a female come?!

838
00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:45.210
Looking

839
00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:45.210
Bright

840
00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:46.990
What should I do about my makeup?!

841
00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:47.950
I have no makeup on though…

842
00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:49.630
Kims! Where are my Kims?!

843
00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:55.430
Let’s have 6 female guests and end this before dinner time!

844
00:19:55.490 --> 00:20:00.060
If we’re still filming passed 8pm, that’s when I’ll turn into a gangster!

845
00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:01.060
Kim Heechul that displays a stark difference between genders

846
00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:05.130
Truthfully his quick wits isn’t like 5 points but around 8-9 points

847
00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:07.390
He’s like 10 points

848
00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:07.870
Unrivaled when it comes to Quick wits

849
00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:10.860
I really don’t have any stamina or ability in Youngchul’s role

850
00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:12.240
The 3rd member to be analysed is Yesung

851
00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:13.030
Next, Yese- Yesung

852
00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:13.030
[T/N: He was about to say Yesex]

853
00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:14.270
Nervous

854
00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:15.730
Okay, Yesung, Hosting 0, so 1 point

855
00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:17.360
Quick wits is 1 point-

856
00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:18.060
Wait a sec, wait a sec...

857
00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:20.060
Reactions is 1 point.

858
00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:21.350
Oh, I agree

859
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:23.170
Stamina is 1 point

860
00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:25.700
- SD: Kim Youngchul skill is 5 points.
-  HC: Sandbag Youngchul skill, 5!

861
00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:28.190
Variety baby sympathizes

862
00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.690
Ugh...

863
00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.480
But this is…

864
00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:32.330
It’s 9’o’clock!

865
00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:36.260
_9PM_
HAHAHA

866
00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:38.280
This is something Hyung thought of.
You thought of this alone.

867
00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:39.240
Let’s talk about it together.

868
00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:41.060
- Let’s talk about it together.
- Ah, okay, we’ll talk about it together.

869
00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:41.880
Ah, before I curse.

870
00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:43.370
Do it again before I start cursing

871
00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:43.990
Hosting, one point!

872
00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:46.790
- Quick wits, one point!
- Why, I’m quick witted!

873
00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:48.860
- Reactions, 1 point!
- My reactions right now are good!

874
00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:50.350
- Stamina, one point!
- Hah, I‘m really-

875
00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:51.040
Really just got 1~

876
00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:52.150
- Kim Youngchul role, you are really good!
- Five points!

877
00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:53.060
I have good stamina!

878
00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:54.680
- Ah, stamina, no...
- You don’t have any.

879
00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:55.680
Wronged

880
00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:56.810
Stamina, why? Why is my stamina not good?

881
00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:59.240
Because your throat is weak

882
00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:03.100
You keep do broadcasts while being cautious of your throat. You think about your throat’s condition

883
00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:03.090
This is a
conspiracy

884
00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:06.660
But, I shout loudly don’t I?

885
00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:09.680
Like, “What do you want me to do right now?!!!”

886
00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:10.900
But you can’t do that for 12 hours

887
00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:13.300
The reflexes you showed
just now, 1 point!

888
00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:15.080
Okay, wait a sec

889
00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:17.900
But, my reactions are good! Whenever the members do something, I react well!

890
00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:19.610
Okay, let’s see it!
Let’s see it!

891
00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:20.930
‘This is fun’.

892
00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:21.970
Oh! Hahahaha!

893
00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:25.170
That’s too much!

894
00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:26.460
His face got so red right now

895
00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:27.950
‘This is sad’.

896
00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:29.880
Even variety baby sees him pitifully

897
00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:29.530
His face is so red

898
00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:30.810
Be sad

899
00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:32.620
Sad Yesung

900
00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:34.930
‘It’s sad, but funny’

901
00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:39.330
Okay, so, 1 point!

902
00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:42.350
- Now next!
- So, Yesung Hyung actually isn’t a variety person, huh.

903
00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:43.440
Oh, I’m stressed.

904
00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:45.100
Yesung who is not satisfied with the result

905
00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.130
Next is Shindong.

906
00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:46.860
Truthfully speaking, Shindong is a five for hosting.

907
00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:48.900
- He’s a different kind of five from you.
- In hosting.

908
00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:50.300
Oh, thank you.

909
00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:53.010
He’s a ‘10’ for hosting events.

910
00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:54.730
For things like events.

911
00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:58.210
I really experienced that feeling
when I was in the army.

912
00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:57.940
Unrivaled in hosting events

913
00:21:58.210 --> 00:22:00.100
Quick wits, 3 points? 4?

914
00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:02.260
For fast thinking, I’m not that high. Truthfully speaking.

915
00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:02.320
Agree

916
00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:04.680
- What about reactions for Shindong?
- Reactions, 4.

917
00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:05.700
I’m really good at laughing in reaction

918
00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:06.930
That’s why it’s a 5 for reactions

919
00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:07.840
Oh, that’s high

920
00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:09.590
- Oh, stamina?
- Stamina...

921
00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:11.680
But his mental is like trash, so...

922
00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:14.760
He runs away if it gets tiring while he’s doing a broadcast!

923
00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:15.660
He’s a broadcast punk!

924
00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:17.610
How many times did I run away for you to say that?!

925
00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:18.070
Feeling

926
00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:18.070
dizzy

927
00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:19.680
You’re a mental trashcan

928
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:22.270
Menseu (Mental trashcan) Stamina 1

929
00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:23.990
And, you’re good at the sandbag role

930
00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:24.660
He’s good at it

931
00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:26.570
Actually, I’m not that good at taking jokes

932
00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:28.160
He’s not the style to just take it

933
00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:30.410
Shindong has a good distribution

934
00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:32.150
Shindong with a good distribution chart

935
00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:31.790
I’m the style to throw jokes

936
00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:34.300
Honestly, I don’t understand my rankings

937
00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:34.680
Grumbling

938
00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:34.680
Grumbling

939
00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:38.890
- YS: Don't you think it makes no sense?
- EH: It makes so much sense to me! For sure

940
00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:42.660
-LT: Shindong’s is such a contrast from Yesung’s
- EH: It’s amazing

941
00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:44.970
Hyung! Don’t you think that I have good stamina, though?

942
00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:48.970
I’m always the first prepared when we go to the salon. I’m always prepared.

943
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:49.760
Sad Yesung

944
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.570
Yesung is cute

945
00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:52.530
Hyukjae

946
00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:53.830
Next is Eunhyuk’s variety type analysis

947
00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:53.090
Hyuk

948
00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:53.530
Eunhyuk

949
00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:56.590
- HC: Hosting is...
- YS: His hosting isn’t that good

950
00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:00.300
If you see Leeteuk as a five, then Eunhyuk is about a 3?

951
00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:01.390
Let’s go with 2~

952
00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:03.440
Hosting is a 2, because I’m a 3.

953
00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:05.480
Because I have programs where I host as the MC

954
00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:06.380
Oh, you’re right

955
00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:07.390
I’m a 2?

956
00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:09.300
Then you’re just 1 point difference with me!

957
00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:12.210
That’s not... It shouldn’t be as low as a 2...

958
00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:15.550
You’re only about a 2. This guy has never hosted before

959
00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:16.290
Yesung who does not agree with Eunhyuk

960
00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:18.130
I do host! I hosted a lot in the army!

961
00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:22.680
Then I’ll tell you exactly. I saw him host while in the army, and I saw that exactly as a 2.

962
00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:25.100
Totally

963
00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:25.100
Speechless

964
00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:24.750
You’ve progressed a lot

965
00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:25.930
I’m not the hosting style

966
00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:26.860
What about reflexes?

967
00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:29.700
He used to be a 5, but he dropped a bit recently, so now he’s a 4

968
00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:34.810
That’s not it, I’m just lying low right now

969
00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:32.040
Totally

970
00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:32.040
disagrees

971
00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:37.950
Wait, for fast thinking, does it have to be funny? Since it’s variety?

972
00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:39.770
If you have sensor... sense...

973
00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:41.350
[T/N: He said sense wrong]

974
00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:41.350
- If you have sensor?
- Sensor?

975
00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:46.860
Since this is variety, you have to have quick wits for things that are suitable to air on broadcast

976
00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:44.180
Why is he
standing up?

977
00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:50.210
- LT: Hey, Eunhyuk is nervous right now.
- EH: No, no.

978
00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:54.180
If this was before he went to the army, Eunhyuk would actually have the best quick wits out of all our members!

979
00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:55.440
He’d break through the rankings

980
00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:58.840
- HC: So, reflexes, right now is 4 points
- EH: Okay, 4

981
00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:00.610
Ah, I can’t drop in reflexes…

982
00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:03.900
Reaction. He’s a bit weak in reactions. Eunhyuk also has a weak throat.

983
00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:05.150
1! Reaction, 1!

984
00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:06.060
Wait, 1 isn’t right

985
00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:07.950
His voice always breaks at concerts

986
00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:11.930
In Super Junior, you have the best stamina as a singer

987
00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:14.730
But stamina for variety... Change it to 1

988
00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:20.260
Hyung, I got a 1 for hosting earlier, but when I did DJ-ing with you... I did DJ-ing by myself for 2 years!

989
00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:23.570
There’s no ranking for ‘grudges’ here, right?

990
00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:25.590
First place in losing temper

991
00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:28.900
And for Youngchul role, 5. You're a good sandbag

992
00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:29.990
He likes it, he likes it

993
00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:30.800
Wait, Hyung!

994
00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:33.240
It’s a notice for 9 o’clock!

995
00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:37.040
The Unanimous Game!

996
00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:38.940
Embarrassed

997
00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:40.970
Hey! This is all you prepared?!

998
00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:42.840
Do this well once~

999
00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:44.100
Can you go away?

1000
00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:46.770
- HC: Eunhyuk, give that to me~
- EH: What?

1001
00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:47.860
[T/N: Word play on 'give' and 'get lost', which sound similar in Korean]

1002
00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:47.860
Get lost~

1003
00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:50.980
Bitter

1004
00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:50.980
smile

1005
00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:52.890
After discharging, he is still buffering

1006
00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:55.860
Anchovy Eunhyuk who dreams to be full level entertainer

1007
00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:57.950
Eunhyuk’s isn’t that different from Yesung’s

1008
00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:00.290
Both look like 9pm

1009
00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:00.990
Let’s shake hands

1010
00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:04.170
Hyung, you can’t say that, Yesung Hyung will stick to me-

1011
00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:03.330
Why are you like this?

1012
00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:06.100
I'm different to Hyung!

1013
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:07.680
- HC: The last one
- SD: Donghae

1014
00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:09.770
Hm, this guy is a bit difficult

1015
00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:10.610
Donghae...

1016
00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:12.940
Today's most difficult variety baby

1017
00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:11.990
He’s a bit hard to evaluate

1018
00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:14.580
Hosting is…

1019
00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:15.560
0!

1020
00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:17.030
Zero? We don’t have zero…

1021
00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:19.180
Let’s go into the negatives, let’s go down to zero! Hosting, zero!

1022
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:22.190
Quick wits, zero. Reaction…

1023
00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:24.080
But he kept giving reactions while eating earlier

1024
00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:25.030
Reactions, 1

1025
00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:26.920
Donghae's little reactions are revealed

1026
00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:29.920
When members are talking

1027
00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:30.230
That’s right, that’s right

1028
00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:29.920
That's right, that's right

1029
00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:31.330
If it’s at Apgujeong-

1030
00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:31.990
When working hard at eating salad

1031
00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:33.530
That can’t happen

1032
00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:35.730
That’s right, that’s right. You have to do that.

1033
00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:37.330
I think so too

1034
00:25:37.530 --> 00:25:38.730
You can’t do that!

1035
00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:39.900
A variety baby with his own audio going on

1036
00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:41.230
Stamina, zero

1037
00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:43.130
Because, he doesn’t have the right attitude

1038
00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:45.030
And the important thing is that he can’t receive things either!

1039
00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:48.230
If you throw him something, he just stays still. He just thinks.

1040
00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:46.340
Excited to diss the youngest

1041
00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:50.580
Okay! Lee Donghae!

1042
00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:53.550
Variety shape for variety baby is?

1043
00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:53.730
Oh! Lee Donghae. His is just a mole under a nose.

1044
00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:59.030
If Donghae is this bad, shouldn’t he not get paid?

1045
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:02.930
You really ate for free this whole time

1046
00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:04.730
If it’s like this, Shindong’s is the best

1047
00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:08.330
The result of Super Junior variety strength analysis

1048
00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:07.230
Oh, Shindong, 5 points… Shindong, Leeteuk…

1049
00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:11.230
You can actually tell who does variety. Looking at the pentagon charts.

1050
00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:14.600
Hosting

1051
00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:14.600
Youngchul
role

1052
00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:14.600
Stamina

1053
00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:14.600
Reactions

1054
00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:14.600
Quick
wits

1055
00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:12.730
You can’t say that I’m a variety person

1056
00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:14.530
You’re specialized in this area though

1057
00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:15.180
To have a 5 means that-

1058
00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:16.280
You and I are not that different

1059
00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:17.530
Hey, that’s not right

1060
00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:20.730
We’ve [LT, HC, SD] done a lot of variety, so we got a distribution.

1061
00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:20.870
But this is an important point!

1062
00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:27.330
But before, when we met the PDs, you, Donghae and Eunhyuk got the most votes

1063
00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:29.730
Who do you want to do this with?

1064
00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:30.050
The most voted Super Junior

1065
00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:30.050
member to work with

1066
00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:31.530
Yesung

1067
00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:31.890
Director Kim Sukhyun -> Yesung

1068
00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:33.730
I like Donghae

1069
00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:34.350
Na Youngseok PD -> Donghae

1070
00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:36.530
I really wanted to do it with Eunhyuk

1071
00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:36.520
CP Kim Yoogeon -> Eunhyuk

1072
00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:37.630
I wanted to do it with Eunhyuk too

1073
00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:38.330
CP Kim Jonghoon -> Eunhyuk

1074
00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:39.930
Eunhyuk for me too

1075
00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:42.100
Team Leader Lee Kihyuk -> Eunhyuk

1076
00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:45.670
No. 1 PD preference with 3 votes!

1077
00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:45.230
I’ll go make coffee!

1078
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:50.730
After that, Teuk and I talked with them, “Why did you choose like this?”

1079
00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:48.870
Shindong and Teuk who are curious of the reason

1080
00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:48.870
After the ppt

1081
00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:52.730
They said they wanted to find hidden gems

1082
00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:56.230
But, I constantly kept doing variety shows before, so why am I a hidden gem…

1083
00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:59.030
The saddest one is this guy. Because he kept doing variety.

1084
00:26:59.030 --> 00:27:02.730
It’s like this, it’s been 12 years since debut but you still feel like a rookie

1085
00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:03.630
I like that feeling

1086
00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:04.730
Until when are you gonna keep hiding?

1087
00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:09.230
But I like that feeling. I don’t really like being seen by what’s on the surface

1088
00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:11.730
I think you have to lose some reflexes. 4, 5?

1089
00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:11.690
Dissing until the end

1090
00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:14.730
I think we need to decide on some rules

1091
00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:17.630
I think we need to decide on some rules

1092
00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:18.230
We need these

1093
00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:18.730
It’s important

1094
00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:21.060
Procedure needed before starting the program!

1095
00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:20.230
This is very important

1096
00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:21.230
Because during Returns…

1097
00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:24.230
Because during Returns, we decided not to be late!

1098
00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:24.000
Deciding Super Junior's rules

1099
00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:28.230
Let’s make some rules, and make a protocol

1100
00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:28.440
For SJ Returns they made Super Junior's

1101
00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:28.440
rule board too

1102
00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:31.030
First, be careful on SNS

1103
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:32.640
1. Be cautious of using SNS
2. Don't be late
3. Appearance management
4. Practice singing and dancing
5. Yesung, please do well
6. Participate in important meetings
7. Follow the leader well

1104
00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:32.230
Don’t be late

1105
00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:35.030
For important meetings, participate properly

1106
00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:35.040
Completed the rules with their heart and soul

1107
00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:35.730
What time is it?

1108
00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:36.230
You’re not late

1109
00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:40.680
Hard working members who protect the rules

1110
00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:37.230
I'm not late

1111
00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:39.230
Oh, everyone came on time

1112
00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:40.230
What time are we going for today?

1113
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:41.030
9 o’clock

1114
00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:42.930
At that time, we weren’t late once

1115
00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:44.030
We weren’t late. I wasn’t late today.

1116
00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:45.530
After that ended, you were late every day!

1117
00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:46.230
Hey…

1118
00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:47.950
Dissatisfaction

1119
00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:47.950
Overreaction

1120
00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:48.230
You’re late every day!

1121
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:49.530
You and Donghae are late the most!

1122
00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:50.390
Super Junior my tardiness leader

1123
00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:49.730
Hyung!

1124
00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:50.230
Hey

1125
00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:50.930
Hyung!

1126
00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:53.160
Hyung!

1127
00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:53.230
Truthfully speaking-

1128
00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:55.230
You talked for the first time today right now!

1129
00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:57.230
Your first word was ‘Hyung’!

1130
00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:58.330
Variety first words "Hyung"

1131
00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:01.230
Truthfully speaking, Donghae is late more often than me.

1132
00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:03.230
Hey, you can’t say that.

1133
00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:07.230
When we did schedules this time around, the time I spent waiting for other members has to be at least 60 hours

1134
00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:11.730
If I’d done variety during that time, I would have done better than the other members!

1135
00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:14.730
That’s not… That’s not right

1136
00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:18.850
How was it? My fast reflexes

1137
00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:19.530
You’re zero for this kind of thing!

1138
00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:22.230
You resort to using your hands whenever I say something!

1139
00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:24.230
I didn’t use my hands, I used my feet!

1140
00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:26.730
I was going for a high-five, with my foot

1141
00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:26.930
Let's do a high five with my foot...

1142
00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:28.730
Hyung, I did okay, right?

1143
00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:31.260
Harsh advice of
level 5 quick wits

1144
00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:31.230
No, you can’t show the viewers the bottom of your foot

1145
00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:33.900
Phase of learning variety skills

1146
00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:33.930
This isn’t important, but we have to decide on it again

1147
00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:38.200
Super Junior's new rules 2018 ver.

1148
00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:36.730
Eunhyuk, since you’re the scribe, write it down

1149
00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:38.200
Official scribe

1150
00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:39.930
For the first rule, don’t be late to schedules

1151
00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:41.910
Suju rule 1

1152
00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:41.910
Don't be late

1153
00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:40.730
Being late

1154
00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:45.230
Don't be too late, on days before schedules, before sleeping, I always think about that…tomor-

1155
00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:47.590
Don’t think about that, just sleep!

1156
00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:54.230
He can’t accept it, his reflexes… His mouth is locked

1157
00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:54.850
Is this the Youngchul role thingy...?

1158
00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:58.230
We have to give Yesung a 1 for reflexes too, wait, no, for Youngchul role

1159
00:28:58.230 --> 00:29:00.730
That’s why for Yesung, it’s 1!

1160
00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:03.230
The No.1 Man. Please change the diagram

1161
00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:05.730
1-sung

1162
00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:06.730
Since your last name is Kim, Kim 1-sung

1163
00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:13.440
1sung that's lost for words because of level 5 quick wits

1164
00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:15.430
All 1, so 1-sung. Not Yesung, but 1-sung

1165
00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.190
Totally happy 0hae

1166
00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:16.190
1-sung!

1167
00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:17.860
Then make is sound cool, call me No.1

1168
00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:19.430
South Korea Number One 1[il]-sung

1169
00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:19.390
All one

1170
00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:22.530
There should be some kind of punishment for being late

1171
00:29:22.530 --> 00:29:24.230
Let's go strong this time

1172
00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:25.630
Going in ice water

1173
00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:26.960
Going in ice water

1174
00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:28.250
Stops-

1175
00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:31.730
Going into ice water... or jumping into the sea

1176
00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:31.770
His voice

1177
00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:34.490
Then I'm not gonna be on this show at all!

1178
00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:34.570
Everyone

1179
00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:34.570
Freeze

1180
00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:34.990
Late people just won't come

1181
00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:37.470
Suddenly sad

1182
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:45.830
The person who's late will use their card or name in the company to buy all the staff dinner that day

1183
00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:46.530
They have to

1184
00:29:46.530 --> 00:29:48.530
To go even stronger than that

1185
00:29:48.530 --> 00:29:50.390
Not receiving pay that day!

1186
00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:53.330
That's a bit...

1187
00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:54.990
- LT: The members
- HC: Giving it to the other members!

1188
00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:56.250


1189
00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:56.250
No

1190
00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:58.860
- EH: You give it to the remaining members
- DH: Do we really have to go that far for being late?

1191
00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:04.030
- EH: It's the most basic thing not to be late
- LT: Let's go for something that's cuter

1192
00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:03.430
Pulling up the root of lateness

1193
00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:03.430


1194
00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:07.230
Let's decide the punishment by turning the roullete. We'll include the ice water as punishment.

1195
00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:12.950
- LT: Being splashed with ice water, being hit by a stick, being hit with the sole, buying food
- SD: Then we will turn it

1196
00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:16.090
No mercy for latecomers!

1197
00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:15.390
Hit by a stick

1198
00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:18.670
- DH: Hyung! Do we have to go this far just for being late?
- HC: End it with buying food

1199
00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:18.400
Too much

1200
00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:21.090
What about something like hugging the member so he won't be late again?

1201
00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:23.010
Ugh! Hey!

1202
00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:24.860
Ah... Lee 0-hae

1203
00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:25.670
With a warm, loving heart

1204
00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:27.110
I've always hugged you so you don't be late

1205
00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:29.360
Yeah exactly, so let's do something like that

1206
00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:34.670
But then again humans can be late once in a while. Let's make exception for the first time

1207
00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:34.710
Truly 1-sung's quick wits

1208
00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:34.710
Fast thinking
is difficult

1209
00:30:34.670 --> 00:30:36.430
No, 0 minutes 0 seconds allowed

1210
00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:40.190
And the second rule, you need to promote on SNS on the broadcast day

1211
00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:41.670
That's right, promotion!

1212
00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:45.530
Doesn't only apply to us, include all the managers and staffs as well

1213
00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:50.250
Suju clock's comeback

1214
00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:51.870
I came first!

1215
00:30:53.150 --> 00:30:54.690
I came first!

1216
00:30:55.850 --> 00:30:58.950
Wait a second! Let's do a round check whether all the staffs have arrived

1217
00:30:57.050 --> 00:30:59.140
Let's be fair and do a
check up on the crew also!

1218
00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:01.610
Our PD-nim? Since like he's not here yet

1219
00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:01.380
Very

1220
00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:01.380
sensitive

1221
00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:03.390
He's not here yet!

1222
00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:03.140
Dis

1223
00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:03.140
trust

1224
00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:05.190
Lee Donghae, this won't do

1225
00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:06.990
He's a thug!

1226
00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:08.490
We're doing it, how is it a business?!

1227
00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:11.030
About to explode!

1228
00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:11.060
- HC: What do you mean 'us'?!
- YS: At our concert you-

1229
00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:14.780
What could have
 made them this angry?

1230
00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:20.020
In the end, the members
could follow the Suju Rules well!

1231
00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:22.430
First place!

1232
00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:24.170
Can I just go in?

1233
00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:30.670
I've heard that the staffs have something to tell us regarding these rules

1234
00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:33.870
Right, PD-nim?

1235
00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:37.710
There's some rule that the PD wants us to keep

1236
00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:41.670
In accordance to the format of our show, the mission will only be released on the spot

1237
00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:44.670
So, you aren't allowed to express dissatisfaction on the mission given

1238
00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:48.590
- EH: Wait a second
- HC: I don't want to do this

1239
00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:53.850
Wait a second! We need to know the extent (of the mission)

1240
00:31:48.850 --> 00:31:50.930
Not this~

1241
00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:53.820
Sudden rush of worries

1242
00:31:53.850 --> 00:31:58.330
- EH: Wait, wait! We need to make a plan between us
- SD: Let's talk amongst ourselves first

1243
00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:58.420
Nervously

1244
00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:58.420
Anxiously

1245
00:31:58.330 --> 00:32:01.990
Then if we accept the rule, we can ask for something

1246
00:31:58.810 --> 00:32:01.830
Calling an emergency strategy meeting

1247
00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:05.730
In order to make this program a bigger hit, let's ask the PD to shave off his hair

1248
00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:04.560
Chat

1249
00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:04.560
Chat

1250
00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.760
In the end, what
will they propose...

1251
00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:08.270
Then let's do this

1252
00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:13.150
If there's something that you feel like you can't do, let's make an exception list

1253
00:32:13.150 --> 00:32:17.070
Three exception coupons

1254
00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:20.590
Okay! Three things you really can't do for each person

1255
00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:19.780
OK Accepted!

1256
00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:23.470
- LT: Okay list it out
- HC: For me firstly,

1257
00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:26.270
Exposure. I really can't expose myself

1258
00:32:26.270 --> 00:32:27.890
- EH: Exposure
- EH: Exposure and...

1259
00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:29.490
You should write 'exposure for others'

1260
00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:31.310
- For others?
- Yes for others

1261
00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:35.810
If he wants to expose himself, he can do that but not if anyone asks him to take clothes off

1262
00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:35.520
Only reveal within my limits

1263
00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:39.150
I do have the tendency to expose myself, I don't like others exposing me

1264
00:32:39.150 --> 00:32:42.450
He can do it for himself, not for the sake of others

1265
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:44.330
And the second one...?

1266
00:32:42.450 --> 00:32:44.070
- HC: What else is there?
- LT: You always have to eat

1267
00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:47.780
Looking for 'food' right when filming starts

1268
00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:46.430
Let's eat breakfast

1269
00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:47.790
Hurry! Let's eat! I am hungry!

1270
00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:49.050
I am hungry!

1271
00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:49.830
Kim Heechul's motivation

1272
00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:53.570
As long as meals are taken care of Anything is possible

1273
00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:53.030
Food food food food!

1274
00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:54.560
PD: That's a relief

1275
00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:57.530
It's a relief

1276
00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:55.590
Meal on time

1277
00:32:55.590 --> 00:33:00.630
Wait, wait! I hear someone shouting out the song "It's a relief" by Lee Juck

1278
00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:03.160
With a low tone, "It's a relief"

1279
00:33:00.930 --> 00:33:03.030
Leave it alone

1280
00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:04.250
Then...

1281
00:33:03.730 --> 00:33:06.190
Suddenly careful

1282
00:33:06.090 --> 00:33:08.530
Meal on- ugh, What should I do?

1283
00:33:06.910 --> 00:33:09.710
What to do...?

1284
00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:11.230
- HC: You guys think first.
- YS: For me, heights.

1285
00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:13.050
- LT: Oh, heights!
- SD: Ah, acrophobia.

1286
00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:15.970
- LT: If there's anyone who has anything in mind, list it.
- SD: Water for me.

1287
00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:18.330
- I am okay with everything else.
- Bungee Jumping

1288
00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:20.750
- EH: Shindong Hyung...
- SD: I can deal with public baths.

1289
00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:22.430
Heights also for me

1290
00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:26.260
- YS: Huh? You don't have acrophobia do you?
- DH: No, no. I don't like heights

1291
00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:28.430
And also... water

1292
00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:30.450
Water?

1293
00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:32.850
Hey, your name is Donghae (East Sea), how can you hate water?

1294
00:33:32.850 --> 00:33:34.830
And you love seafood so much

1295
00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:36.850
That really doesn't suit you

1296
00:33:35.290 --> 00:33:38.210
Donghae / Not the sea

1297
00:33:35.290 --> 00:33:38.210
Man who lives differently to his name

1298
00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:39.190
For me, eating

1299
00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:42.690
For example if I have to eat things that I can't eat

1300
00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:43.930
Things like seafood for you

1301
00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:47.350
- EH: Yeah, for example live octopus. That is really just.
- HC: Me too!

1302
00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:50.610
- EH: Because back then, what program was it again?
- LT: It was on MBC Every1

1303
00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:50.180
Eunhyuk is usually a picky eater

1304
00:33:50.610 --> 00:33:52.610
You have to eat exotic food

1305
00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:53.870
Nah Misuk was hosting that programme

1306
00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:56.070
I went on that programme, what I ate on that program was,

1307
00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:56.710
Cheese!

1308
00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:58.550
Raw rabbit's liver and-

1309
00:33:58.150 --> 00:33:59.950
Reaction level 5
Reaction

1310
00:33:58.550 --> 00:33:59.550
You ate that?

1311
00:33:59.550 --> 00:34:03.430
And something called Monster Cheese which smelled of poop

1312
00:34:03.090 --> 00:34:05.280
Reaction level 1
Reaction

1313
00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:05.730
Eating poop would have been better

1314
00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:10.270
But then, since my reaction was so good,

1315
00:34:10.270 --> 00:34:14.850
They asked me to put the monster cheese on top of the raw liver

1316
00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:17.950
This is why his stamina got a full 5

1317
00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:20.480
Even if it was just that time, I had level 5 stamina...

1318
00:34:17.950 --> 00:34:19.530
So for me, it is eating

1319
00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:21.010
I wanna add another one

1320
00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:22.850
Shooting too early in the morning

1321
00:34:22.850 --> 00:34:26.370
At what time? What is your standards of early?

1322
00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:28.690
Since my face swells a lot in the morning

1323
00:34:28.690 --> 00:34:29.550
11 AM

1324
00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:31.590
But if we film overseas, we need to start early

1325
00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:33.030
Do we have time to go overseas?

1326
00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:35.130
Ah...

1327
00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:34.270
Are we going abroad?

1328
00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:36.450
To be honest, I prefer doing things in the country

1329
00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:41.890
Because of Yesung's acrophobia, even when we are in the flight, he just sits like this

1330
00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:49.050
There was once when we took a flight during a rainy day, he goes all "aaaaah~" alone beside me

1331
00:34:50.130 --> 00:34:54.450
I prefer if the shooting starts after 11am, within the country

1332
00:34:54.450 --> 00:34:55.890
Okay Hyung, after 11am only

1333
00:34:55.890 --> 00:34:57.750
What do you want, Leeteuk?

1334
00:34:57.770 --> 00:35:01.290
Well for me, there's nothing I specifically am scared of

1335
00:35:01.330 --> 00:35:08.380
Yeah, Leeteuk is good at doing everything. He's the kind of variety idol that staffs love

1336
00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:08.580
Variety talent of this era

1337
00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:11.830
Nothing "special" to report

1338
00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:15.890
For me, making me host. Take me out of it

1339
00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:16.230
Now we're slowly getting to the end...

1340
00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:17.790
Hosting? Okay

1341
00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:19.970
Something like asking me to talk a lot

1342
00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:23.130
Ah, not forcing you to talk a lot

1343
00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:24.430
Voluntary variety participation strongly requested

1344
00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:24.160
No talking on a variety!

1345
00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:28.730
On a variety show! Not talking! What do you wanna do then?

1346
00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:28.430
Our members are still amazing even after 13 years

1347
00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:32.760
I will just do it when I want to. So- water, heights, and talking

1348
00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:32.480
Will not say anything unless it's funny

1349
00:35:33.130 --> 00:35:36.190
On a variety show, only talking when you want to

1350
00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:36.130
Variety philosophy of 0-hae alone

1351
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:44.410
You probably won't have screen time on broadcast then. We will feature those are that more funny the most

1352
00:35:46.330 --> 00:35:48.280
Stern

1353
00:35:46.330 --> 00:35:48.280
Cold

1354
00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:47.730
Ah, coldly?

1355
00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:48.730
That's cold

1356
00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:52.920
But me- that won't work for me. I really can't do games

1357
00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:55.620
To be funny, you have to do some personal talent like making sounds of pigeons flying.

1358
00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:57.390
How can I win over something like this?

1359
00:35:57.430 --> 00:35:58.150
Just do it, you rascal!

1360
00:35:58.150 --> 00:36:01.000
I can't do all these games if you do it like a survival show

1361
00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.970
This isn't a survival show! What survival show you are talking about?

1362
00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:04.930
Is this Survival Super Junior?

1363
00:36:05.370 --> 00:36:12.230
We're not doing this individually, but as a group. What the staffs are talking about is-

1364
00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:11.680
Explanation of the program for Lee 0-hae

1365
00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:11.680
Super TV is a program that will recreate all the
variety program formats in SJ's own style

1366
00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:13.330
Complaining if you don't have much screentime

1367
00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:14.730
I won't do that

1368
00:36:13.930 --> 00:36:15.880
Of course

1369
00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:19.730
You just have to observe. If you feel like this member is doing well on that day, just stick right next to him.

1370
00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:20.730
That's wise

1371
00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:22.730
HC: Then we'll never see Yesung and Donghae next to each other

1372
00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:23.280
1-sung teaching 0-hae kk

1373
00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:25.730
There was someone who called me asking to show him the initial editing before broadcast

1374
00:36:26.290 --> 00:36:28.060
- SD: Initial editing?
- HC: It was you wasn't it?

1375
00:36:27.730 --> 00:36:29.390
smirk

1376
00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:29.530
Why did you ask to see that?

1377
00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:31.730
I was just curious since it's been a long time I've been on TV

1378
00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:35.160
Something that is exclusively for the PD, how dare you!

1379
00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:36.780
So actually

1380
00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:36.780


1381
00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:36.860
You really asked him to show you?

1382
00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:41.860
No but since I have no idea, I got so excited. That is why.

1383
00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:44.060
That's why I thought Donghae had passion for variety shows

1384
00:36:44.330 --> 00:36:45.670
So that's how the story started

1385
00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:46.670
That was passionate

1386
00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:48.250
Touched~

1387
00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:48.450
It's a relief that you thought of me nicely

1388
00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:51.280
What else is there? Hurry, let's eat!

1389
00:36:48.730 --> 00:36:51.220
I also
..want to..
be praised

1390
00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:53.330
Lastly, you are not allowed to release spoilers of the show!

1391
00:36:53.330 --> 00:36:54.530
I agree on this one

1392
00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:59.330
I heard that someone was talking about our show before at a fansign

1393
00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:59.470
171111 Super Junior Sincheon Fansign Fanacc
T SJ Returns- since the response was so good, they are preparing an individual
SJ variety show similar to EHB~ get excited!

1394
00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:59.470
And they said there will be a group variety show like EHB ㅠㅜㅜ

1395
00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:59.470
Since the response to Returns was so good, they said they're preparing an SJ variety show like EHB~

1396
00:36:55.170 --> 00:36:59.430
Recently Super TV has been
spoiled for some people

1397
00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:00.620
What did he talk about?

1398
00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:02.300
Hahah~

1399
00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:02.620
I never say things like that?

1400
00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:07.000
But for me- I wasn't spoiling the show I just

1401
00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:07.180
Members attack

1402
00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:08.580
Then from these punishments-

1403
00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:12.030
Hey, you guys were there too! You were there too! You all were there!

1404
00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:14.080
We were kinda surprised. Is he allowed to talk about it?

1405
00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:16.730
Humiliated leader's drowning plan

1406
00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:15.330
I was just saying we are doing something together

1407
00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:16.730
He talked about the repackage too

1408
00:37:16.730 --> 00:37:19.730
But you have to think it from the staffs perspective, they might have not liked it

1409
00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:21.500
Only after consulting with the crew we can do spoilers

1410
00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:20.780
Keeping your mouth shut

1411
00:37:21.730 --> 00:37:22.630
Rules decided~

1412
00:37:22.130 --> 00:37:25.480
All satisfied (?)

1413
00:37:22.130 --> 00:37:25.480
finishing the rules

1414
00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:24.230
How did they know though?

1415
00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:24.880
We don't have many

1416
00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:26.630
If there's misregulation of our rules-

1417
00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:28.260
But how
..did you..
know about it?

1418
00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:27.320
How did you know?

1419
00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:28.120
It was on SNS?

1420
00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:30.930
Is there seal at this house? Do I have my seal?

1421
00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:33.430
You are not going to eat, are you?

1422
00:37:35.090 --> 00:37:38.400
0-hae gets full points on voluntary variety

1423
00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:36.330
You are good~!

1424
00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:38.880
No, there was stuff to eat in that room, I saw

1425
00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:39.880
Get your fingers printed here

1426
00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:40.730
You have to get your fingerprints

1427
00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:44.560
- EH: The rules this time round is quite simple
- HC: Yesung's finger is really small

1428
00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:45.430
YS: I did it with my pinky finger

1429
00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:46.630
DH: Were you making a promise?

1430
00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:51.450
Shindong returns with something

1431
00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:48.590
No

1432
00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:50.030
But this can't be broadcasted

1433
00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:51.450
What's that?

1434
00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:51.570
Do we have to do it with our thumbs?

1435
00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:54.330
He really brought out his seal!

1436
00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:57.960
Official seal is ready

1437
00:37:56.730 --> 00:37:57.930
What is this?

1438
00:37:57.930 --> 00:38:00.430
This is... what I use when I need to sign.. for business

1439
00:38:00.730 --> 00:38:02.030
You are doing business again?

1440
00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:03.730
Stop that already!

1441
00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:07.030
Let's forbid business! No business!

1442
00:38:07.330 --> 00:38:10.660
Why do you wanna forbid bussiness? It's my personal life!

1443
00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:10.400
Unfair

1444
00:38:10.830 --> 00:38:15.930
Then, there's something I wanna add. No personal schedules on filming days

1445
00:38:16.090 --> 00:38:23.690
Don't say things like you have something to do at whatever time. Because of an individual, we always have change things up.

1446
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:21.480
Uh-oh

1447
00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:24.520
This is
..not okay..

1448
00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:25.030
No! That won't do for me.

1449
00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:27.630
- LT: That's not for us but for the sake of the staffs
- HC: I know right?!

1450
00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:30.230
- LT: That's probably what the staff want
- EH: Hyung, you were bribed by the staff, right?

1451
00:38:30.410 --> 00:38:31.480
Me? Me?

1452
00:38:31.530 --> 00:38:35.660
When we were writing, the PD and staff were saying something

1453
00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:34.960
.Truthfully.

1454
00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:34.960
Smack

1455
00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:34.960
.Confess .

1456
00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:34.960
Smack

1457
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:39.180
Thanks to Shindong

1458
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:39.180
Completed rules they are all satisfied with

1459
00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:38.090
But, it is kinda right to do

1460
00:38:38.090 --> 00:38:39.630
But not just this-

1461
00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:41.790
It is for the sake of the show to do well

1462
00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:42.990
That's for our sake too then

1463
00:38:43.330 --> 00:38:46.730
So it is completed~

1464
00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:46.910
Super Junior Rules Finished ver. 2018

1465
00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:48.330
Super TV Rules

1466
00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:48.810
1. Don't be late

1467
00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:48.810
(Have to buy food for the staff, butt slap)

1468
00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:50.700
2. Have to promote the show on SNS before it airs

1469
00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:50.700
(Includes members, managers, film crew)

1470
00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:54.430
3. No spoilers, keep your mouth shut

1471
00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:54.430
4. No businesses

1472
00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:54.430
5. No personal schedules on filming day

1473
00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:54.450
Will everyone be able to follow them?

1474
00:38:54.730 --> 00:38:55.940
Now let's go eat

1475
00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:56.940
Let's eat

1476
00:38:57.330 --> 00:38:59.630
We will change location for the first filming

1477
00:38:59.630 --> 00:39:00.720
This is the the first shoot?

1478
00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:00.930
Yes

1479
00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:04.330
We are only starting the first filming. No, it hasn't even started.

1480
00:39:04.330 --> 00:39:10.030
That Owl PD really talks too much! His glasses look like an owl too!

1481
00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:10.500
Hoot~

1482
00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:10.500
Hoot~

1483
00:39:11.130 --> 00:39:15.830
Since xTVN is a new broadcast channel, we will open up a party

1484
00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:16.480
Prepared a grand party

1485
00:39:15.830 --> 00:39:17.190
Will we be wearing tuxedos?

1486
00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:19.280
Excited

1487
00:39:18.430 --> 00:39:18.930
Really?

1488
00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:21.630
Isn't it that kind of party? The one where we kept eating last time?

1489
00:39:22.350 --> 00:39:23.920
Crazy Variety SUPER TV

1490
00:39:24.130 --> 00:39:25.730
Ready? Let's go!

1491
00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:26.890
Let's go to the location of the mysterious (?) party!

1492
00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:33.690
Through 0Hae's lead

1493
00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:33.690
The ride's already in a party mood

1494
00:39:34.490 --> 00:39:37.730
Charging up the excitement

1495
00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:40.930
So far, his variety show energy is still alive

1496
00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:42.570
Working hard

1497
00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:42.570
Simply excited

1498
00:39:42.730 --> 00:39:45.130
It can't be simply a party. There must be something when we get there

1499
00:39:42.970 --> 00:39:44.800
(worrying about the show by himself)

1500
00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:44.800
I'm sure it's not just a party...

1501
00:39:43.730 --> 00:39:44.800
We'll have to do something...

1502
00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:46.120
Is it like Amor Fati?

1503
00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:46.070
Amor Fati?

1504
00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:50.110
Up and down

1505
00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:50.110
Up and down

1506
00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:51.930
Since it is the first episode, it must be something tough

1507
00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:52.280
(worried about the show)

1508
00:39:52.130 --> 00:39:53.430
I wanna have a pajama party

1509
00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:53.310
I wanna have a Pajama Party

1510
00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:57.850
0Hae who's working hard in giving reactions

1511
00:39:57.930 --> 00:40:02.230
Wearing pajamas~

1512
00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:01.290
In the midst of all this, the sorrowful 1Sung

1513
00:40:02.090 --> 00:40:09.430
Why does Yesung Hyung sing so sadly?

1514
00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:11.200
When did I do that?

1515
00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:10.530
When did I do that?

1516
00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:12.530
Check it later on the broadcast

1517
00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:18.930
So, where are we heading right now?

1518
00:40:18.930 --> 00:40:20.030
We’re going somewhere to party

1519
00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:22.310
curious

1520
00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:22.310
Really

1521
00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:22.630
I’m really curious, what are they going to film?

1522
00:40:22.730 --> 00:40:24.130
We're having a party

1523
00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:28.730
But everyone here is probably thinking in their heads, it's not just a party

1524
00:40:29.130 --> 00:40:31.030
I thought it's just a normal party

1525
00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:32.730
We really became 6 people

1526
00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:33.430
How?

1527
00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:35.130
I don't know you bastard

1528
00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:37.460
Suddenly a cursing party(?)

1529
00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:37.530
Why are you ******* swearing!?

1530
00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:38.930
*******

1531
00:40:40.490 --> 00:40:42.560
Wild reactions at the violent show of affection

1532
00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:44.130
It's fun when I curse right?

1533
00:40:44.130 --> 00:40:45.230
I don't think this can air

1534
00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:46.730
It's because there's no real malice behind it

1535
00:40:47.330 --> 00:40:48.930
Of course Hyung has no malice

1536
00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:51.330
What about a Bachelor party?

1537
00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:51.170
How about a bachelor party?

1538
00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:53.210
That’s good

1539
00:40:51.730 --> 00:40:53.330
Oh that sounds great

1540
00:40:53.830 --> 00:40:56.930
There are a lot of people who think Shindong isn't a bachelor

1541
00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:57.840
Hitting with strong words

1542
00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:57.840
Speechless

1543
00:40:57.660 --> 00:41:00.930
The name of the program I did was called ‘A Bachelor In a Relationship’

1544
00:40:59.210 --> 00:41:02.950
The Bachelor goes on a Date (2008)

1545
00:40:59.210 --> 00:41:02.950
Leeteuk as the MC, a hidden camera kind of program
where distracting events keep happening while on a date

1546
00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:04.730
Let's do this kind of thing too

1547
00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:07.850
Putting one person up to a blind date!

1548
00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:13.930
Put one member on a blind date. We know about each other but we don't know what their attitude is like toward a girl.

1549
00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:13.660
How will the members act in the presence of the opposite sex?

1550
00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:15.530
I think that would be interesting

1551
00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:17.560
That seems fun?

1552
00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:17.830
Thrilling Suju-ting

1553
00:41:17.830 --> 00:41:21.230
The girl will do a date for six times with all the members

1554
00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:22.570
[T/N: From MNET's show 'The Thrilling Blind Date']

1555
00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:22.570
The Thrilling SUJU-ting

1556
00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:22.570
A program wherein SUJU members
compete for one girl's heart

1557
00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:26.030
Let's do something similar to that and choose the best man

1558
00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:29.530
I really wanted to make an appearance on X-Men and Love Letter in the past

1559
00:41:27.010 --> 00:41:31.740
1Sung who wished to appear on a dating show...

1560
00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:32.130
Seeing other members on those programs… I was envious

1561
00:41:32.130 --> 00:41:35.230
It's good that you didn't, I got hurt because I was edited out

1562
00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:35.480
Only got hurt because of being edited out

1563
00:41:35.230 --> 00:41:37.630
Just because you got hurt, that doesn't mean I would get hurt too

1564
00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:39.990
Somehow this feels bitter..
.                                                 0Hae and 1Sung

1565
00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:40.230
But I think you would get hurt back then, same as me

1566
00:41:40.330 --> 00:41:41.460
Let's do a We Got Married between us

1567
00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:42.230
Between the members?

1568
00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:44.160
We vote between us

1569
00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:45.730
Ah between the members?

1570
00:41:44.490 --> 00:41:46.130
Between

1571
00:41:44.490 --> 00:41:46.130
Us guys?

1572
00:41:45.930 --> 00:41:47.530
Let's do "We GTLT"

1573
00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:50.900
We Live Together

1574
00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:55.030
A program where SUJU members
will be living with each other

1575
00:41:53.530 --> 00:41:56.330
Let's do a We Got To Live Together by making couples between the members

1576
00:41:56.330 --> 00:41:59.030
Let's put the most awkward members together!!

1577
00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:58.500
The two most awkward people together

1578
00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:02.040
Uncomfortable combination line 1
Donghae x Shindong

1579
00:41:59.030 --> 00:42:00.130
Then I want to live with Shindong Hyung

1580
00:42:00.130 --> 00:42:02.130
SD: No!! Don't! Please!

1581
00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:03.930
YS: Heechul-Leeteuk

1582
00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:08.880
Uncomfortable combination line 2
Heechul x Leeteuk

1583
00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:09.130
EH: That's right! Leeteuk Hyung and Heechul Hyung living together will match even less

1584
00:42:09.150 --> 00:42:12.950
Uncomfortable combination line 3
Eunhyuk x Yesung

1585
00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:11.690
He's really mean isn't he?

1586
00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:16.530
Shall we talk about a variety program we've watched recently?

1587
00:42:16.530 --> 00:42:19.530
Let's take some ideas from those

1588
00:42:19.730 --> 00:42:21.330
For me, SJ returns was the most fun

1589
00:42:21.930 --> 00:42:24.130
Going on a group trip, that was so much fun

1590
00:42:24.130 --> 00:42:26.230
The trip! Escape the restaurant!

1591
00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:33.430
When it was released on Naver, it topped on the Daily, Weekly, Monthly Charts.

1592
00:42:27.870 --> 00:42:34.640
SJ Returns channel ranked 1st
on daily, weekly, monthly charts

1593
00:42:27.930 --> 00:42:34.640
Total number of views: 25M (according to Naver)

1594
00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:34.830
And even surpassed 240,000 views

1595
00:42:34.830 --> 00:42:41.530
Other celebrities said they had fun watching SJ returns so I was really happy

1596
00:42:41.830 --> 00:42:44.530
Gugudan’s Mina said she enjoyed watching it

1597
00:42:42.050 --> 00:42:44.620
Devoted viewer gugudan Mina

1598
00:42:44.530 --> 00:42:46.230
When is Mina going to appear here?

1599
00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:47.430
Oh, I hope she can come

1600
00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:53.730
Lets do a Mina special and call GGD’s Mina, Twice’s Mina, and World Cup singer Mina

1601
00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:57.860


1602
00:42:56.830 --> 00:42:57.930
DH: Old fashioned people

1603
00:42:58.430 --> 00:43:00.730
Praises for quick wit regarding the 'Mina' idea~

1604
00:42:58.430 --> 00:43:01.230
Please call Gugudan’s Mina as a guest

1605
00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:02.570
What else can we do?

1606
00:43:01.930 --> 00:43:05.730
Oh! What do you think about watching a movie as a group? Sounds good right?

1607
00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:04.770
All watching a movie together?

1608
00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:04.770
0Hae’s idea

1609
00:43:05.730 --> 00:43:07.430
It won't even air a thing due to copyright

1610
00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:08.630
It can just show our faces

1611
00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:12.930
EH: Only the scene of us going into the theater would be shown

1612
00:43:12.930 --> 00:43:14.830
DH: But it would be fun if we do it together

1613
00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:15.150
A plan which is very 0Hae like....

1614
00:43:15.430 --> 00:43:23.330
Or let's do Sujumanman, something like Yashimmanman and have a talk show with those people who look down on us

1615
00:43:16.450 --> 00:43:21.090


1616
00:43:16.450 --> 00:43:21.090
SUJUMANMAN

1617
00:43:23.330 --> 00:43:26.530
EH: Let's do a staring competition since it's Pyeongchang Olympics

1618
00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:30.360
HC: Let's do fortune telling for 2018

1619
00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:33.960
I want to have my fortune told by a physiognomist

1620
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.830
Super fortune-telling

1621
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.830
A program which explains your fortune
based on facial features and palm reading

1622
00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:34.990
Yeah something like that!

1623
00:43:34.990 --> 00:43:38.260
Let's do shamanism special episode

1624
00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:43.630
We'll do shamanism and then the next episode, we'll do T-moneyism

1625
00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:43.630
[T/N: Play on words]

1626
00:43:43.630 --> 00:43:44.440
Stuff like a tour using public transport

1627
00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:48.150
Tmoney-ism

1628
00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:48.150
A program wherein SUJU
will be using the public transportation

1629
00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:48.490
Using different public transports each

1630
00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:50.920
Shamanism -> Tmoney-ism -> Rainism

1631
00:43:48.490 --> 00:43:51.460
And then after that we do Rainism and then all take turns to perform rainism

1632
00:43:53.130 --> 00:43:54.630
What will you do?

1633
00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:56.530
Donghae should try to hold his pee in

1634
00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:56.760
Donghae pee

1635
00:43:57.090 --> 00:43:58.930
Holding your pee in, in a car

1636
00:43:59.230 --> 00:43:59.930
Suddenly?

1637
00:43:59.430 --> 00:44:01.890
Su...ddenly?

1638
00:44:00.330 --> 00:44:01.730
But Donghae's scared of water

1639
00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:04.230
HC: If you're scared of water, does it mean you can't pee?

1640
00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:07.230
DH: I'm 0 points at receiving jokes, I can't answer

1641
00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:07.630
I'm 0hae... what are you expecting...

1642
00:44:07.730 --> 00:44:09.730
EH: Let's do hearing test

1643
00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:12.730
SD: There's something like this right, get evaluated by drawing...

1644
00:44:12.730 --> 00:44:13.730
HC: Oh yeah!

1645
00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:17.030
HC: Super Vitamin

1646
00:44:16.310 --> 00:44:20.610
Super Vitamin

1647
00:44:16.310 --> 00:44:20.610
A program wherein SUJU members
take a medical examination

1648
00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:20.430
SD: Yeah! Mental Medical checkup...

1649
00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:22.710
Let's test our IQ's

1650
00:44:21.130 --> 00:44:22.530
EH: How about we do an IQ test?

1651
00:44:22.530 --> 00:44:26.190
HC: I got scolded by my teacher because my IQ came out as 20 when I was in middle school

1652
00:44:23.550 --> 00:44:29.120
Middle school student

1653
00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:27.730
"Won't you do things properly?!"

1654
00:44:29.130 --> 00:44:31.960
HC: I don't know where are we going to. They aren't giving any instructions either

1655
00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:34.230
EH: I really have no idea what we're doing

1656
00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:38.330
SD: No one ask us to do it but we talked a lot because the cameras are on!

1657
00:44:38.330 --> 00:44:41.730
HC: No one even told us to do anything

1658
00:44:39.730 --> 00:44:42.800
No one gave directed them to do anything...

1659
00:44:44.170 --> 00:44:47.040
Leeteuk who is taking a rest for a bit

1660
00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:50.340
Saving up energy for the party filming later

1661
00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:52.330
LT: I think I have to sleep now so that I can film later

1662
00:44:52.330 --> 00:44:54.230
HC: I’m so sleepy, I'm done now, I wanna go home

1663
00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:55.710
Please look at our Hyungㅋㅋ

1664
00:44:56.110 --> 00:45:01.090
Yawn_that also wants to be_shown on broadcast

1665
00:44:58.130 --> 00:45:00.530
HC: I've talked more than on Knowing Bros

1666
00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:02.410
DH: Ah, but

1667
00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:04.330
T/N: (geundae means 'but' in Korean and it has a similar pronunciation with army=gundae)

1668
00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:04.190
No but...

1669
00:45:02.830 --> 00:45:04.130
SD: We’ve already discharged from the army

1670
00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:04.190
You've been to the army

1671
00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:05.590
No..but

1672
00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:08.230
No but...

1673
00:45:05.590 --> 00:45:07.210
I said we’ve already discharged from the army

1674
00:45:05.890 --> 00:45:08.230
I said you've been to the army already

1675
00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:09.890
DH: BUT

1676
00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:10.530
Clearly

1677
00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:10.530
But.

1678
00:45:09.890 --> 00:45:11.690
Yeah, it’s modern (geundae) society

1679
00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:13.530
HC: But -> Muscled Pig

1680
00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:13.530
[T/N: He means Geundae is an abbreviation for muscle=Geun(yook) pig=Dwae(ji)]

1681
00:45:14.850 --> 00:45:18.190
No, but… that... you know...

1682
00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:19.870
Say something!

1683
00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:20.970
Frustrated

1684
00:45:21.550 --> 00:45:23.330
HC: Let’s teach Donghae Korean first

1685
00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:25.210
Forget variety show

1686
00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:26.810
Let's take a Korean proficiency test

1687
00:45:26.810 --> 00:45:29.390
Hyung, you know that right? What was it...

1688
00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:34.890
HC: We should let Donghae and people like Sam Okyere battle to see who speaks Korean better

1689
00:45:32.050 --> 00:45:35.120
[T/N: Woorimal battle is also a TV show]

1690
00:45:32.050 --> 00:45:35.120
Woorimal Battle (with Donghae)

1691
00:45:32.050 --> 00:45:35.120
Foreigner VS. Donghae
A match on whose better at our
language

1692
00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:36.560
He'd be much better

1693
00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:41.390
Korean language ability is also 0...?

1694
00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:41.490
HC/SD: Okyere’s Korean is really good

1695
00:45:41.710 --> 00:45:42.490
It's Oil Bank!

1696
00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:44.930
Oil Party?

1697
00:45:43.490 --> 00:45:44.310
Oil party?

1698
00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:49.640
Let's go to the dentist

1699
00:45:45.890 --> 00:45:46.950
Let's go to the Dentist

1700
00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:49.640
Teeth(?) party?

1701
00:45:47.170 --> 00:45:48.150
SD: Teeth party?

1702
00:45:49.970 --> 00:45:52.170
My_members_are_the funniest in the world

1703
00:45:52.070 --> 00:45:54.630
Wow seriously, you guys are really good

1704
00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:56.940
Amazed

1705
00:45:54.910 --> 00:45:55.790
At what?

1706
00:45:56.010 --> 00:45:56.890
Everything

1707
00:45:57.090 --> 00:46:00.670
You guys would be the best at talking among idols right?

1708
00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:01.350
No

1709
00:46:01.350 --> 00:46:02.510
I feel prideful of you

1710
00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:04.110
No, there are people better than your Hyungs

1711
00:46:04.110 --> 00:46:08.760
EH: We have both the best talkers and the worst talkers in our team

1712
00:46:09.930 --> 00:46:11.070
How can we have both?

1713
00:46:10.890 --> 00:46:15.090
From 0 to 5, they are evenly distributed, which makes them the best combination

1714
00:46:11.450 --> 00:46:13.530
We have to be a mix to do well

1715
00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:16.950
Wait I think we're here?

1716
00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:19.200
I think we're here?

1717
00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:20.450
No, the atmosphere doesn't have a party feeling

1718
00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:21.970
There's no party
feeling here?

1719
00:46:22.650 --> 00:46:24.010
It's a market here

1720
00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:26.010
Are we doing something at the market?

1721
00:46:26.690 --> 00:46:28.260
Who will be in charge of this market?

1722
00:46:26.690 --> 00:46:27.970
[T/N: Word play on the words "market" and "charge" that sound similar in Korean]

1723
00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:28.570
Who will take over this market?

1724
00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:33.180
What is this party place which surprised the members..

1725
00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:35.250
What is that blue box?

1726
00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:34.490
EH: What's that

1727
00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:36.170
LT: Food show

1728
00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:38.920
Ey. This. Can't. Be!

1729
00:46:38.170 --> 00:46:38.930
SD: Oh no way!

1730
00:46:39.050 --> 00:46:42.620
That's why we prepared

1731
00:46:39.050 --> 00:46:42.620
Escape the restaurant IRL

1732
00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:42.390
SD: Escape the restaurant?

1733
00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:44.110
SD: Do we go the place we pick?

1734
00:46:47.610 --> 00:46:48.630
EH: We have to eat all the food here?

1735
00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:51.360
The board game pan was remade with restaurants!

1736
00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:55.050
You rented this whole place?

1737
00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:52.500
A number from the board game represents a restaurant

1738
00:46:52.830 --> 00:46:54.530


1739
00:46:55.050 --> 00:46:56.370
DH: It will be fun today

1740
00:46:55.490 --> 00:46:57.700
Escape the restaurant: Real life version

1741
00:46:56.370 --> 00:46:57.690
SD: This sounds okay though

1742
00:46:57.930 --> 00:47:01.460
EH: Escape The Restaurant is fun and all but you've made the scale too big!

1743
00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:02.890
Let's not do things like this!
