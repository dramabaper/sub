Jae Beom.

4
00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:59.965
Take the next flight
coming back to Korea.

5
00:01:00.484 --> 00:01:01.793
Soo Jin...

6
00:01:02.456 --> 00:01:04.142
just walked in.

7
00:01:13.352 --> 00:01:15.034
You're here?

8
00:01:15.034 --> 00:01:17.001
Have you been doing well?

9
00:01:19.373 --> 00:01:22.183
I'm so shocked that
I'm at a loss for words.

10
00:01:25.618 --> 00:01:27.719
So you speak, instead.

11
00:01:31.404 --> 00:01:33.028
Have you been doing well?

12
00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:36.144
How have you been doing up until now?

13
00:01:36.861 --> 00:01:41.573
You're still wearing the coat that
I bought you 10 years ago, I see.

14
00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:59.104
I have a favor to ask of you.

15
00:02:00.241 --> 00:02:02.211
So that's why you came.

16
00:02:03.386 --> 00:02:05.162
I need money.

17
00:02:06.855 --> 00:02:08.425
How much?

18
00:02:08.425 --> 00:02:10.134
10 million won.

19
00:02:12.164 --> 00:02:13.783
Are you ill?

20
00:02:13.783 --> 00:02:15.135
No.

21
00:02:18.916 --> 00:02:20.773
Did you cause trouble, then?

22
00:02:22.138 --> 00:02:26.937
You never asked me for even
10,000 won after becoming an adult

23
00:02:26.937 --> 00:02:30.693
and you insisted on paying for
your own meals, no matter what

24
00:02:30.693 --> 00:02:32.194
so, what's going on?

25
00:02:33.015 --> 00:02:37.183
What on earth had to happen that
you'd come to me to borrow money?

26
00:02:37.707 --> 00:02:39.501
Can't you just...

27
00:02:42.648 --> 00:02:45.575
not ask me anything and
lend it to me, just this once?

28
00:02:49.426 --> 00:02:51.229
Do you want it in cash?

29
00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:52.926
Or as a bank transfer?

30
00:02:53.785 --> 00:02:55.766
Cash, please.

31
00:03:29.423 --> 00:03:31.204
I have one condition.

32
00:03:35.147 --> 00:03:37.296
Meet with me just 10 times.

33
00:03:38.121 --> 00:03:40.140
Every time you meet with me...

34
00:03:40.718 --> 00:03:42.752
I'll give you a million won.

35
00:03:42.752 --> 00:03:44.096
How does that sound?

36
00:04:02.812 --> 00:04:04.607
My mom...

37
00:04:05.108 --> 00:04:06.702
will come.

38
00:04:06.702 --> 00:04:08.846
She's not the kind of person
who wouldn't come.

39
00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.302
Where do you live?

40
00:04:14.521 --> 00:04:16.011
Um...

41
00:04:16.514 --> 00:04:17.850
a sauna?

42
00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:19.963
Do you know about saunas?

43
00:04:19.963 --> 00:04:21.598
They're so nice!

44
00:04:21.598 --> 00:04:23.281
You don't have a home?

45
00:04:23.281 --> 00:04:24.944
I was told we'd find one soon.

46
00:04:31.716 --> 00:04:34.944
But... what is this sound?

47
00:04:35.735 --> 00:04:38.954
Jingle... jangle.

48
00:04:40.555 --> 00:04:42.038
Hello.

49
00:04:42.038 --> 00:04:43.382
Ah, yes. Please take
a seat over there.

50
00:04:43.382 --> 00:04:44.420
Sure.

51
00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.439
Get me a chemotherapy appointment.

52
00:04:47.156 --> 00:04:49.351
I feel like I'll be able to do it
all of the sudden.

53
00:04:51.398 --> 00:04:54.324
When will I find out whether or
not I'll be able to get surgery?

54
00:05:02.776 --> 00:05:04.771
I waited for you.

55
00:05:04.771 --> 00:05:06.146
I know.

56
00:05:41.163 --> 00:05:42.766
Yoon Bok!

57
00:05:45.625 --> 00:05:47.288
Yoon Bok?

58
00:05:48.225 --> 00:05:49.701
Yoon Bok.

59
00:05:53.223 --> 00:05:55.177
Did I surprise you?

60
00:05:58.831 --> 00:06:00.531
Mom!

61
00:06:00.531 --> 00:06:02.298
What is it, Hye Na?

62
00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.322
Have you ever seen such nice towels?

63
00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:21.050
Where has she been all this time?

64
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:22.314
Let's...

65
00:06:22.944 --> 00:06:25.064
all eat dinner together tomorrow.

66
00:06:27.324 --> 00:06:29.843
Don't ask her where she's been.

67
00:06:29.843 --> 00:06:35.471
Or why she came, why she left,
or what she plans to do now, either.

68
00:06:35.471 --> 00:06:40.636
And definitely don't tell her
that I have cancer.

69
00:06:40.636 --> 00:06:43.680
What am I supposed to talk to
her about, then? The weather?

70
00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:44.776
Politics?

71
00:06:44.776 --> 00:06:47.071
Or celebrity gossip,
as if we're just acquaintances?

72
00:06:47.071 --> 00:06:48.853
About the fact that you got married.

73
00:06:49.579 --> 00:06:52.216
About how you almost died
giving birth to twins.

74
00:06:52.826 --> 00:06:54.970
About how your mother-in-law is peculiar.

75
00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:56.355
And...

76
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:59.432
the cat you guys are raising is cute.

77
00:06:59.901 --> 00:07:03.254
And about how you almost
got divorced last year.

78
00:07:05.442 --> 00:07:06.480
Hey!

79
00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.101
Be quiet, you guys!

80
00:07:10.077 --> 00:07:12.963
You weren't scared of the lady
at the barber shop?

81
00:07:14.564 --> 00:07:16.694
Why would I be scared?

82
00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:21.430
Kids used to be really scared
of her when I was young.

83
00:07:22.374 --> 00:07:24.271
That lady...

84
00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:27.516
is missing a pinky.

85
00:07:28.108 --> 00:07:29.288
Did you see it?

86
00:07:30.151 --> 00:07:31.672
Really?

87
00:07:32.173 --> 00:07:35.024
There are rumors that
she lost it while in prison.

88
00:07:35.846 --> 00:07:38.189
And some say that she killed someone.

89
00:07:39.851 --> 00:07:41.697
When I was young

90
00:07:41.697 --> 00:07:43.966
guys would go into the barber shop

91
00:07:43.966 --> 00:07:46.473
and yell, "Murderer!"

92
00:07:46.473 --> 00:07:49.365
as a test of courage.

93
00:07:51.766 --> 00:07:55.718
I had to pass by it every day
on my way home.

94
00:07:56.636 --> 00:07:59.701
When I saw the sign for the
barber shop from far away...

95
00:08:00.216 --> 00:08:03.509
I got so scared that I started running.

96
00:08:03.509 --> 00:08:06.161
I feel so sorry for that lady.

97
00:08:37.342 --> 00:08:38.918
<i>Miss Ye Eun.</i>

98
00:08:38.918 --> 00:08:42.105
<i>I am hoping that I won't be
needing to send you this letter.</i>

99
00:08:42.706 --> 00:08:47.668
<i>Because I am only planning
to send you this letter</i>

100
00:08:47.668 --> 00:08:50.929
<i>if Hye Na and I couldn't escape
this country safely, as planned.</i>

101
00:08:52.788 --> 00:08:54.831
<i>What I fear the most right now</i>

102
00:08:54.831 --> 00:08:58.244
<i>isn't that I'll be arrested
for kidnapping</i>

103
00:08:58.244 --> 00:09:02.493
<i>but that things go wrong, and Hye Na will
have to return to her mom and that man.</i>

104
00:09:03.038 --> 00:09:05.855
<i>Please look over the materials
that I've sent you</i>

105
00:09:05.855 --> 00:09:10.462
<i>and please help us so that Hye Na
will not have to return to those people.</i>

106
00:09:10.462 --> 00:09:14.888
<i>I don't think there is a person
who could do this better than you.</i>

107
00:09:16.038 --> 00:09:20.419
<i>I won't resent you even if
you report me to the cops.</i>

108
00:09:21.149 --> 00:09:24.210
<i>Please take care of this
matter as you see fit.</i>

109
00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:25.434
<i>[Kim Hye Na]</i>

110
00:09:25.946 --> 00:09:27.469
This way.

111
00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:31.652
A lot of people worry about their safety
with these types of homes.

112
00:09:31.652 --> 00:09:33.787
But you needn't worry
about that here.

113
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.730
Because as you can see,
the police station is right up front.

114
00:09:42.254 --> 00:09:43.389
Um...

115
00:09:43.888 --> 00:09:45.907
do you have any other
homes available?

116
00:09:46.652 --> 00:09:48.168
Please come in.

117
00:09:50.894 --> 00:09:52.644
Take a look around.

118
00:09:55.768 --> 00:09:57.828
How long are you looking
to stay here?

119
00:09:57.828 --> 00:09:59.909
At the very least,
half a month.

120
00:09:59.909 --> 00:10:01.673
And no longer than two months.

121
00:10:01.673 --> 00:10:04.807
Goodness, not even three months,
but just one or two months?

122
00:10:04.807 --> 00:10:06.629
I'll give you two months'
worth of rent up front.

123
00:10:06.629 --> 00:10:09.152
The owner won't want to do that.

124
00:10:09.152 --> 00:10:11.181
Because if you live here for only
two months, but ruin the floor

125
00:10:11.181 --> 00:10:13.441
it'll be a huge nuisance for them.

126
00:10:13.441 --> 00:10:15.131
And you have a kid, to boot!

127
00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:19.701
You should look into a student hostel
or something, instead.

128
00:10:19.701 --> 00:10:22.306
Other real estate brokers
will tell you the same thing.

129
00:10:37.485 --> 00:10:39.952
"To Oh Cheol, in Heaven."

130
00:10:39.952 --> 00:10:42.357
"Oh Cheol,
I'm Kim Hye Na from Class 1-3."

131
00:10:42.357 --> 00:10:44.208
"Where are you right now?"

132
00:10:44.208 --> 00:10:46.080
"Do you not feel any pain anymore?"

133
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:49.072
"I want to go there, too."

134
00:10:49.072 --> 00:10:50.320
<i>Dear Miss Soo Jin.</i>

135
00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.802
<i>I received your letter.</i>

136
00:10:52.802 --> 00:10:56.831
<i>I hope that you reach your
destination safely.</i>

137
00:10:56.831 --> 00:11:01.121
<i>I hope that I can be of help
to you, if only a little.</i>

138
00:11:05.083 --> 00:11:08.212
<i>"Then, I'll follow you."</i>

139
00:11:09.625 --> 00:11:11.255
"But until then, goodbye."

140
00:11:12.182 --> 00:11:15.575
By "where you are,"
she means Heaven.

141
00:11:15.575 --> 00:11:17.418
And by, "I'll follow you,"
she means...

142
00:11:17.418 --> 00:11:18.635
Does she mean that she'll kill herself?

143
00:11:18.635 --> 00:11:20.841
I thought the same thing, too.

144
00:11:20.841 --> 00:11:23.096
How could a nine year old
think of committing suicide?

145
00:11:24.197 --> 00:11:26.091
While Hye Na was walking
down to the harbor

146
00:11:26.091 --> 00:11:28.451
she kept on looking
at the birds that were flying.

147
00:11:29.081 --> 00:11:33.283
So, on the day she went to the harbor,
she followed Oh Cheol.

148
00:11:33.283 --> 00:11:35.596
I feel like this totally makes sense.

149
00:11:36.634 --> 00:11:39.607
Um, there are other things
that you also need to see.

150
00:11:39.607 --> 00:11:42.756
I found these among the temporary
homeroom teacher's records.

151
00:11:42.756 --> 00:11:46.950
And there's a part where Hye Na clearly
confesses that her mom abused her.

152
00:11:49.001 --> 00:11:52.639
<i>[Consultation Record Card]</i>

153
00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:00.952
Aren't you going to sleep?

154
00:12:01.683 --> 00:12:04.046
I feel like I'll go crazy
if I just sit still.

155
00:12:12.236 --> 00:12:14.860
I shouldn't have given birth to her.

156
00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:18.510
I shouldn't have given birth to her!

157
00:12:19.683 --> 00:12:20.857
But I...

158
00:12:23.173 --> 00:12:25.951
why did I give birth to her?

159
00:12:28.919 --> 00:12:30.113
Honey.

160
00:12:31.817 --> 00:12:33.897
Hold me, please.

161
00:12:59.259 --> 00:13:00.541
Oh yeah.

162
00:13:00.541 --> 00:13:03.485
Don't touch the electric kettle.

163
00:13:03.485 --> 00:13:05.850
And be careful when you use
the hot water at the sink, too.

164
00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:07.970
And be careful when you
jump on the bed.

165
00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:09.519
And don't open the door for anyone.

166
00:13:09.519 --> 00:13:10.558
Okay.

167
00:13:10.558 --> 00:13:12.158
I'll be right back after having dinner.

168
00:13:12.158 --> 00:13:14.248
I won't be back too late,
so don't worry, okay?

169
00:13:14.248 --> 00:13:16.130
All right, I got it.

170
00:13:16.621 --> 00:13:18.312
So hurry up and go.

171
00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:41.591
Location of emergency shelters.

172
00:13:55.273 --> 00:13:56.798
<i>To be honest...</i>

173
00:13:57.721 --> 00:14:01.182
there were many times that I thought
that it'd be nice if she died.

174
00:14:02.609 --> 00:14:04.238
But, Honey...

175
00:14:07.412 --> 00:14:09.471
Why does my heart feel like...

176
00:14:09.961 --> 00:14:11.755
it'll shatter?

177
00:14:15.775 --> 00:14:17.081
It hurts...

178
00:14:18.951 --> 00:14:20.870
so much.

179
00:14:46.595 --> 00:14:48.601
Is that you, Soo Jin?

180
00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:52.270
These are Yi Jin's twins.
Seven years old.

181
00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:54.095
Their names are Tae Hoon and Tae Mi.

182
00:14:54.095 --> 00:14:56.990
- Hello!
- Hello!

183
00:14:58.091 --> 00:14:59.447
Hi there.

184
00:14:59.447 --> 00:15:01.604
Big Sis!

185
00:15:01.604 --> 00:15:05.548
Big Sis! It's been so long!

186
00:15:05.548 --> 00:15:06.952
It's been a while.

187
00:15:06.952 --> 00:15:09.287
Oh, sorry. I ate a little
before you got here.

188
00:15:09.287 --> 00:15:11.426
I left work for a bit
even though we're busy

189
00:15:11.426 --> 00:15:13.278
just so that I could see you.

190
00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:15.330
You're here, Big Sis?

191
00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:17.908
This is about to overflow,
so I can't come out to greet you.

192
00:15:23.267 --> 00:15:25.677
- Wow!
- Wow!

193
00:15:25.677 --> 00:15:28.201
- Wow, I'm so hungry!
- You like crab, right?

194
00:15:28.201 --> 00:15:31.006
I went to Noryangjin this morning
to make you some crab stew.

195
00:15:31.006 --> 00:15:33.616
Wow, this is so good!

196
00:15:33.616 --> 00:15:35.119
But I have to go now.

197
00:15:35.119 --> 00:15:36.544
You should eat more before you go.

198
00:15:36.544 --> 00:15:39.336
I was planning to leave after I just
got a glimpse of Big Sis's face.

199
00:15:40.076 --> 00:15:42.528
It's so nice to see your face, Big Sis!

200
00:15:42.528 --> 00:15:45.254
You'll be in Seoul until
the weekend, right? I'll call you.

201
00:15:45.254 --> 00:15:46.528
Big Sis Yi Jin.

202
00:15:46.528 --> 00:15:48.086
The food was so delicious.

203
00:15:48.086 --> 00:15:50.062
Your kimchi casserole is
truly a work of art.

204
00:15:50.062 --> 00:15:51.476
I'll be going now, Mom!

205
00:15:51.476 --> 00:15:52.707
Your auntie is leaving now, kids!

206
00:15:52.707 --> 00:15:54.749
- See you later!
- See you later!

207
00:15:55.652 --> 00:15:57.836
That's what she's been like lately

208
00:15:57.836 --> 00:16:01.085
since she became a reporter
at a daily newspaper last month.

209
00:16:01.085 --> 00:16:02.231
That's great for her.

210
00:16:02.231 --> 00:16:04.134
And she causes trouble every day.

211
00:16:04.134 --> 00:16:06.359
I'm worried that she'll
get fired one of these days.

212
00:16:06.359 --> 00:16:08.929
Well, she works really hard, though.

213
00:16:11.648 --> 00:16:13.286
This is delicious.

214
00:16:13.286 --> 00:16:14.323
Really.

215
00:16:15.403 --> 00:16:18.448
Mom said that you'd probably
want to eat home-cooked food.

216
00:16:18.448 --> 00:16:20.125
She's right.

217
00:16:20.125 --> 00:16:22.120
I did want to eat something like this.

218
00:16:23.392 --> 00:16:25.663
Did you two greet your
big aunt properly?

219
00:16:25.663 --> 00:16:26.999
- Yes!
- Yes!

220
00:16:26.999 --> 00:16:31.275
I thought she'd be huge
since she's called "Big Aunt"

221
00:16:31.275 --> 00:16:33.428
but she's not even that big!

222
00:16:33.428 --> 00:16:35.452
She's similar to Aunt Hyun Jin.

223
00:16:35.452 --> 00:16:38.178
What are you talking about?
I'm so much bigger.

224
00:16:40.018 --> 00:16:43.102
You didn't know that you had
such a big niece and nephew, right?

225
00:16:43.102 --> 00:16:44.432
Yes.

226
00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:48.347
The kids really take after you.

227
00:16:49.269 --> 00:16:52.528
Tae Hoon looks like his dad
and Tae Mi looks like me.

228
00:16:52.528 --> 00:16:53.673
No.

229
00:16:54.391 --> 00:16:56.861
A part of Tae Hoon looks like you did
when you were young.

230
00:16:56.861 --> 00:16:57.980
Really?

231
00:17:58.055 --> 00:18:00.076
My Tae Hoon hates losing.

232
00:18:00.076 --> 00:18:01.624
He has to be number one at everything.

233
00:18:01.624 --> 00:18:03.384
He's just like his dad.

234
00:18:03.384 --> 00:18:07.778
His dad is number one when it comes to
his studies, his work, and drinking.

235
00:18:07.778 --> 00:18:11.928
And my Tae Mi loves all things beautiful.
She's just like me in that sense.

236
00:18:12.438 --> 00:18:14.346
You hate losing too, though.

237
00:18:14.346 --> 00:18:15.467
Really?

238
00:18:15.467 --> 00:18:20.382
She wants to raise her kids to be clever,
so she takes them everywhere.

239
00:18:21.396 --> 00:18:22.814
What about the piano?

240
00:18:23.992 --> 00:18:25.602
I'm not really passionate
about it anymore.

241
00:18:25.602 --> 00:18:28.093
I haven't been passionate about
anything else since I've had my kids.

242
00:18:28.093 --> 00:18:30.844
There are other people besides me
who are good at playing piano

243
00:18:30.844 --> 00:18:33.259
but my kids need me.

244
00:18:33.259 --> 00:18:36.307
Blood relations are such
a scary thing, in that sense.

245
00:18:36.307 --> 00:18:38.667
I don't know what I would've done
if I didn't have my kids.

246
00:18:49.778 --> 00:18:52.395
"Bus ticket."

247
00:18:53.644 --> 00:18:57.999
"Automatic ticket machine."

248
00:19:05.468 --> 00:19:08.032
"Word game."

249
00:19:12.159 --> 00:19:14.395
"When a balloon gets bigger and bigger."

250
00:19:15.766 --> 00:19:17.941
"The road that leads to the ocean."

251
00:19:20.211 --> 00:19:27.813
<i>"The snip-snip sound
of hair being cut."</i>

252
00:19:34.059 --> 00:19:35.999
<i>"Mom."</i>

253
00:19:35.999 --> 00:19:38.182
<i>"The sound of mom laughing."</i>

254
00:19:44.622 --> 00:19:45.936
13 times 1 is 13.

255
00:19:45.936 --> 00:19:47.952
13 times 2 is 26.

256
00:19:47.952 --> 00:19:49.557
13 times 3 is 39.

257
00:19:49.557 --> 00:19:51.076
13 times 4 is 52.

258
00:19:51.076 --> 00:19:52.496
13 times 5 is 65.

259
00:19:52.496 --> 00:19:54.506
13 times 6 is 78.

260
00:19:54.506 --> 00:19:57.222
Do kids usually memorize their
multiplication tables at seven years old?

261
00:19:57.222 --> 00:19:59.633
He memorized up to the
nine times table when he was five.

262
00:19:59.633 --> 00:20:01.046
Now he knows up to the 19 times table.

263
00:20:01.046 --> 00:20:03.589
13 times 10 is 130.

264
00:20:27.605 --> 00:20:29.899
19 times 17 is 323.

265
00:20:29.899 --> 00:20:31.655
19 times 18 is 342.

266
00:20:31.655 --> 00:20:33.522
19 times 19 is 361!

267
00:20:33.522 --> 00:20:35.041
Wow!

268
00:20:35.041 --> 00:20:36.660
Great job!

269
00:20:39.811 --> 00:20:43.126
That's amazing, Tae Hoon.

270
00:20:43.126 --> 00:20:44.848
I was so, so surprised.

271
00:20:44.848 --> 00:20:46.522
Thanks for reciting that for me.

272
00:20:48.539 --> 00:20:52.298
I'm sure you were quite taken aback
since I came here out of the blue.

273
00:20:52.298 --> 00:20:55.041
So thank you, most of all,
for being so hospitable toward me.

274
00:20:55.041 --> 00:20:56.758
I feel like you're
the older sister here.

275
00:21:00.186 --> 00:21:02.347
I'll be going now for today.

276
00:21:02.347 --> 00:21:04.641
- I have something I must do...
- Excuse me.

277
00:21:05.124 --> 00:21:07.195
I have something to show you, too.

278
00:21:10.443 --> 00:21:14.512
<i>What are little boys made of?</i>

279
00:21:14.512 --> 00:21:18.582
<i>What are little boys made of?</i>

280
00:21:56.026 --> 00:21:57.534
Yoon Bok.

281
00:22:01.233 --> 00:22:02.769
Yoon Bok?

282
00:22:06.432 --> 00:22:08.268
Yoon Bok!

283
00:22:12.009 --> 00:22:15.291
Yoon Bok, hurry and come out!
We're not playing hide-and-seek!

284
00:22:21.896 --> 00:22:24.377
<i>I'm going to the barber shop.</i>

285
00:22:30.794 --> 00:22:32.007
Mom.

286
00:22:32.007 --> 00:22:33.886
Why are you here?

287
00:22:34.832 --> 00:22:36.815
Do you know how scared I was?

288
00:22:36.815 --> 00:22:38.130
I'm sorry.

289
00:22:38.593 --> 00:22:40.835
There were no cartoons
on our TV, so...

290
00:22:42.617 --> 00:22:45.717
I apologize for being such a burden.

291
00:22:45.717 --> 00:22:47.709
- Let's go.
- Mom.

292
00:22:47.709 --> 00:22:49.391
I have to use the bathroom.

293
00:22:53.722 --> 00:22:56.867
Let's chat for a second, Mother.

294
00:22:57.761 --> 00:22:59.409
Pardon me.

295
00:23:11.558 --> 00:23:14.196
She didn't come here to watch cartoons.

296
00:23:14.196 --> 00:23:17.594
<i>She wasn't even wearing proper clothes
and her lips were all blue</i>

297
00:23:17.594 --> 00:23:19.228
<i>and she was shivering
when she ran over here.</i>

298
00:23:19.228 --> 00:23:23.136
I... want to watch cartoons.

299
00:23:26.531 --> 00:23:28.067
I may be overstepping my boundaries

300
00:23:28.067 --> 00:23:30.297
by saying this to you, but...

301
00:23:31.092 --> 00:23:34.623
she seems to be too young
to be left alone at night.

302
00:23:36.319 --> 00:23:38.279
You're right.

303
00:23:38.903 --> 00:23:40.442
Thank you.

304
00:23:42.182 --> 00:23:43.590
Let's go.

305
00:23:48.976 --> 00:23:50.329
You're cold, right?

306
00:23:57.729 --> 00:23:59.749
To be honest, Mom...

307
00:24:00.319 --> 00:24:02.750
someone came by before to catch us.

308
00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:04.032
Who?

309
00:24:04.032 --> 00:24:08.951
Someone knocked on the door
and then let themselves in.

310
00:24:08.951 --> 00:24:13.457
And they looked through the bathroom
and under the sheets, too.

311
00:24:13.457 --> 00:24:15.886
They looked under the sheets, too?

312
00:24:15.886 --> 00:24:18.126
I was hiding in the wardrobe

313
00:24:18.126 --> 00:24:21.698
and barely managed to get out by looking
at the emergency shelter instructions.

314
00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:26.376
Didn't they also look through the garbage
and organize the towels, too?

315
00:24:26.376 --> 00:24:27.571
Yes!

316
00:24:28.542 --> 00:24:30.885
What do we do now?

317
00:24:32.881 --> 00:24:35.210
All we need to do now is wash up
and get some rest.

318
00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:37.286
They came by to clean up
our room, is all.

319
00:24:37.816 --> 00:24:39.104
Why?

320
00:24:39.104 --> 00:24:40.464
Let's go.

321
00:24:49.528 --> 00:24:52.709
Wow, she truly is crazy.

322
00:24:52.709 --> 00:24:54.844
Is she really her biological mother?

323
00:24:55.597 --> 00:24:58.685
What about the footage from the hospital
hallway, and the stairs on the road?

324
00:24:58.685 --> 00:25:00.863
There's no CCTV camera
in the hallway.

325
00:25:00.863 --> 00:25:03.368
And we're checking for any footage
taken at the staircase now.

326
00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:07.275
You were scared today, right?

327
00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:10.878
I wasn't scared at all.

328
00:25:10.878 --> 00:25:13.557
I should have thought about that sooner.

329
00:25:13.557 --> 00:25:14.990
I'm sorry.

330
00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:17.920
I wasn't scared, so don't be sorry.

331
00:25:21.326 --> 00:25:23.265
But, Yoon Bok.

332
00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:28.019
About the lady from the barber shop.

333
00:25:28.563 --> 00:25:31.681
Don't go see her too often
just because she's nice to you.

334
00:25:31.681 --> 00:25:34.084
We're on the run right now, after all.

335
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.782
We can't get too close to people.

336
00:25:37.782 --> 00:25:40.183
But she's not a bad person.

337
00:25:41.286 --> 00:25:42.641
Still.

338
00:25:43.104 --> 00:25:44.772
All right.

339
00:25:46.881 --> 00:25:48.311
Thanks.

340
00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:52.855
But...

341
00:25:53.524 --> 00:25:55.634
Do you know your times tables?

342
00:25:55.634 --> 00:25:56.719
Yes.

343
00:25:56.719 --> 00:25:58.218
<i>Two times one is two.</i>

344
00:25:58.218 --> 00:25:59.555
<i>Two times two is four.</i>

345
00:25:59.555 --> 00:26:01.121
<i>Two times three is six.</i>

346
00:26:01.121 --> 00:26:03.680
<i>Two times four is...</i>

347
00:26:07.797 --> 00:26:09.517
<i>Two times one is two.</i>

348
00:26:09.517 --> 00:26:11.065
<i>Two times two is four.</i>

349
00:26:11.065 --> 00:26:12.443
<i>Two times three is six.</i>

350
00:26:12.443 --> 00:26:13.807
<i>Two times...</i>

351
00:26:48.316 --> 00:26:51.073
I really won't be late today.

352
00:26:51.584 --> 00:26:52.584
I promise.

353
00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:00.035
I'll hang this in front of the door.

354
00:27:00.035 --> 00:27:01.356
So that nobody can come in.

355
00:27:01.356 --> 00:27:04.701
"Do not enter."

356
00:27:07.759 --> 00:27:09.236
Are you coughing?

357
00:27:09.759 --> 00:27:12.180
Something is caught in my throat.

358
00:27:13.683 --> 00:27:15.173
Go ahead.

359
00:27:25.207 --> 00:27:26.292
Oh, she's here.

360
00:27:26.292 --> 00:27:28.442
Sorry for being late.

361
00:27:28.442 --> 00:27:29.926
Soo Jin!

362
00:27:30.642 --> 00:27:31.951
Mister!

363
00:27:31.951 --> 00:27:34.186
Where have you been
all this time?

364
00:27:34.186 --> 00:27:35.354
Chief Yoo.

365
00:27:35.354 --> 00:27:37.038
Show them to us, in order.

366
00:27:37.038 --> 00:27:38.038
Yes, Ma'am.

367
00:27:45.659 --> 00:27:47.546
We'll start with this.

368
00:28:45.076 --> 00:28:47.671
Wow!

369
00:28:47.671 --> 00:28:49.547
This looks kind of like the dress that

370
00:28:49.547 --> 00:28:51.332
Jackie Kennedy wore before
the inauguration, right?

371
00:28:51.332 --> 00:28:55.586
She has a straight, firm silhouette
going down from her neck to shoulders.

372
00:28:55.586 --> 00:28:57.661
That's why refined things suit her.

373
00:28:57.661 --> 00:28:59.851
I don't need such extravagant clothes.

374
00:28:59.851 --> 00:29:00.999
Why not?

375
00:29:00.999 --> 00:29:03.202
I have nowhere to go
with these sorts of clothes on.

376
00:29:03.202 --> 00:29:07.326
You can go anywhere if you
wear clothes like these, Soo Jin!

377
00:29:07.326 --> 00:29:11.196
No man will overstep his bounds toward
a woman who is dressed in a refined way.

378
00:29:11.196 --> 00:29:13.337
So, even in your weakest moment

379
00:29:13.337 --> 00:29:15.018
your clothes will protect you.

380
00:29:15.018 --> 00:29:19.728
I'd like it if I could be the one to
protect myself at any time, instead.

381
00:29:20.346 --> 00:29:22.425
Exactly! That's exactly
what I'm saying!

382
00:29:22.425 --> 00:29:25.803
We're busy, Chief Yoo.
Please, hurry it up.

383
00:29:25.803 --> 00:29:28.574
Um, we'll need a coat, pants

384
00:29:28.574 --> 00:29:31.845
and lots and lots of
your best sweaters.

385
00:29:31.845 --> 00:29:36.638
Because I may not be able to buy her
clothes again for another 10 years.

386
00:29:38.278 --> 00:29:39.670
Oh yes, and things she likes.

387
00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:40.826
She, um...

388
00:29:40.826 --> 00:29:42.747
likes simple things.

389
00:29:42.747 --> 00:29:47.659
You know, boring clothes
like a Catholic school's uniform.

390
00:29:48.403 --> 00:29:50.053
She quite likes clothes like that.

391
00:29:56.077 --> 00:30:01.077
<font color="#fcc89b">[DramaFever Ver] tvN E04 Mother</font>

392
00:31:07.788 --> 00:31:09.259
Wow.

393
00:31:09.259 --> 00:31:10.933
You look great, Young Miss.

394
00:31:10.933 --> 00:31:12.756
Yes, that suits you.

395
00:31:12.756 --> 00:31:15.265
Which clothes from the spring collection
do you currently have?

396
00:31:15.265 --> 00:31:17.986
They're downstairs.
Shall we go?

397
00:31:26.935 --> 00:31:29.308
Let's chat for a bit, Mister.

398
00:31:35.246 --> 00:31:37.740
I know that you're good
at keeping secrets.

399
00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:39.692
And I also know that
there's nothing you can't do.

400
00:31:39.692 --> 00:31:42.921
You'd always come find me
whenever I ran away from home.

401
00:31:42.921 --> 00:31:45.402
Do you know how surprised
I was each time you found me?

402
00:31:45.402 --> 00:31:47.711
I can't do that anymore, Soo Jin.

403
00:31:47.711 --> 00:31:49.921
I've gotten old now, too.

404
00:31:49.921 --> 00:31:54.403
If you go too far away,
it'll be too rough on me.

405
00:31:54.403 --> 00:31:55.940
Mister.

406
00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:58.164
I need your help.

407
00:31:58.164 --> 00:32:01.913
For the first time in my life.
I truly need your help.

408
00:32:04.135 --> 00:32:06.642
I'm not going to do anything
that involves hurting anyone.

409
00:32:06.642 --> 00:32:10.500
And I can't help you leave
and never come back.

410
00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:14.442
Because if I do that,
your mother will rip me to shreds.

411
00:32:16.238 --> 00:32:19.422
It's okay...

412
00:32:20.395 --> 00:32:21.983
if it's a little illegal, right?

413
00:32:32.932 --> 00:32:36.190
<i>"If you become a tree, Mom..."</i>

414
00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:37.676
"I..."

415
00:32:37.676 --> 00:32:43.392
"will become a small sailboat..."

416
00:32:43.392 --> 00:32:49.291
"and float far, far away."

"If I become a small

418
00:33:27.662 --> 00:33:29.065
Miss Shin Ja Young.

419
00:33:29.065 --> 00:33:32.025
You are under arrest
for child abuse.

420
00:33:32.025 --> 00:33:34.729
You have the right to remain silent.

421
00:33:34.729 --> 00:33:37.451
And you have the right
to an attorney.

422
00:33:37.451 --> 00:33:38.769
Do you understand?

423
00:33:56.484 --> 00:33:58.355
Let go.

424
00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:25.785
Welcome.

425
00:34:25.785 --> 00:34:27.660
Your guest is already here.

426
00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:29.497
We will store your
belongings for you.

427
00:34:29.497 --> 00:34:30.599
All right.

428
00:34:44.168 --> 00:34:45.553
You're here?

429
00:34:45.553 --> 00:34:47.023
Oh, Doctor Jung!

430
00:34:47.023 --> 00:34:48.428
Did we keep you waiting?

431
00:34:48.428 --> 00:34:49.903
I just got here myself.

432
00:34:49.903 --> 00:34:52.633
Oh, you always say that.

433
00:34:52.633 --> 00:34:53.840
Soo Jin.

434
00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:56.267
This is Doctor Jung Jin Hong.

435
00:34:56.267 --> 00:35:00.322
I always pester him,
and visit him quite a bit.

436
00:35:01.912 --> 00:35:04.361
And this is my daughter,
Kang Soo Jin.

437
00:35:04.930 --> 00:35:06.410
I've heard a lot about you.

438
00:35:07.137 --> 00:35:08.389
Take a seat.

439
00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.986
You didn't tell me about
how beautiful she is.

440
00:35:14.986 --> 00:35:16.231
I'm a bit flustered.

441
00:35:18.445 --> 00:35:20.894
Oh, you're still a man
through and through, I see.

442
00:35:20.894 --> 00:35:23.061
Even you know how to
say such pleasantries.

443
00:35:23.706 --> 00:35:26.890
Because frankly,
she's no beauty.

444
00:35:27.508 --> 00:35:29.564
A supplementary shoot?

445
00:35:36.131 --> 00:35:39.135
Why didn't you tell me that I had
a supplementary shoot scheduled?

446
00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:42.892
All right, I'll head over
there right now, then.

447
00:35:43.624 --> 00:35:47.805
Oh, I'm sorry, everyone,
but something came up.

448
00:35:47.805 --> 00:35:49.035
A supplementary shoot.

449
00:35:49.693 --> 00:35:51.227
Oh yes, please go ahead.

450
00:35:51.227 --> 00:35:52.235
All right, then.

451
00:35:52.235 --> 00:35:54.385
Take your time and
enjoy your meals, then.

452
00:35:54.385 --> 00:35:56.610
Soo Jin, smile while you're eating.

453
00:36:08.898 --> 00:36:11.220
So, my mom is a regular
at your office?

454
00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:12.938
Yes, she is.

455
00:36:12.938 --> 00:36:14.785
It must be quite tough for you.

456
00:36:14.785 --> 00:36:16.303
Well...

457
00:36:16.303 --> 00:36:17.582
yes.

458
00:36:17.582 --> 00:36:20.186
But she's a patient I respect, so...

459
00:36:20.186 --> 00:36:21.780
Res... pect?

460
00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:23.604
She's honest,
just like a young child.

461
00:36:23.604 --> 00:36:24.722
And she's so cool.

462
00:36:24.722 --> 00:36:28.883
Don't you realize that she's lying
about there being a shoot?

463
00:36:28.883 --> 00:36:30.039
Pardon?

464
00:36:32.456 --> 00:36:35.633
May I explain today's menu?

465
00:36:35.633 --> 00:36:38.055
No. Later, please.

466
00:36:38.055 --> 00:36:39.160
Yes, ma'am.

467
00:36:40.923 --> 00:36:43.798
She uses that kind of excuse whenever
she has to rush off somewhere.

468
00:36:43.798 --> 00:36:46.640
"Supplementary shoot.
Rehearsal. A fitting."

469
00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:48.463
And why is she in a hurry today?

470
00:36:48.463 --> 00:36:50.934
Because she wants to get us together.

471
00:36:51.943 --> 00:36:53.428
Oh.

472
00:36:53.428 --> 00:36:55.106
I'm sorry.

473
00:36:55.106 --> 00:36:56.505
But I...

474
00:36:57.126 --> 00:36:58.983
have someone who is waiting for me.

475
00:36:58.983 --> 00:37:00.823
Oh, really?

476
00:37:00.823 --> 00:37:04.322
I'm not always such an
impolite person

477
00:37:04.322 --> 00:37:07.492
but I really don't want to fall
for one of Mom's tricks today.

478
00:37:07.492 --> 00:37:08.948
I apologize.

479
00:37:10.077 --> 00:37:12.990
Yes, that's no good to be
tricked by your mother.

480
00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:14.813
I'll be going now.

481
00:37:14.813 --> 00:37:16.412
I'll see you off.

482
00:37:16.412 --> 00:37:18.160
I can go by myself.

483
00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:19.914
I apologize for everything.

484
00:37:28.088 --> 00:37:29.682
To the hospital.

485
00:37:30.244 --> 00:37:32.972
You're getting chemotherapy
tomorrow morning, correct?

486
00:37:32.972 --> 00:37:35.818
I'm going to be hospitalized tonight
and undergo some tests first.

487
00:37:35.818 --> 00:37:38.111
You've made a wise decision.

488
00:37:39.331 --> 00:37:40.834
To the hospital.

489
00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:42.921
I'm so tired.

490
00:38:08.532 --> 00:38:10.249
May I give you a ride?

491
00:38:14.394 --> 00:38:17.631
I always tell myself that
I should clean inside my car, but...

492
00:38:18.512 --> 00:38:21.019
if I knew this would happen,
I would've cleaned it beforehand.

493
00:38:21.852 --> 00:38:23.383
I apologize.

494
00:38:23.383 --> 00:38:25.323
You're going camping, I see.

495
00:38:25.323 --> 00:38:27.023
Yes.

496
00:38:30.012 --> 00:38:33.178
This has been bothering me
since before, but...

497
00:38:33.749 --> 00:38:35.077
to be honest

498
00:38:35.077 --> 00:38:39.764
Ms. Cha wasn't plotting to
try and get us together.

499
00:38:39.764 --> 00:38:42.823
I'm the one who begged her
to introduce me to you.

500
00:38:42.823 --> 00:38:44.985
Ms. Cha refused, saying that
she didn't want to be a bother

501
00:38:44.985 --> 00:38:47.278
when you'd come back after so long.

502
00:38:48.238 --> 00:38:50.912
I've always loved birds,
since I was young.

503
00:38:51.570 --> 00:38:54.816
I'd get up at 5:30 in the morning
in the summer and go to the hills

504
00:38:54.816 --> 00:38:58.160
and in the winter,
I'd take the bus to Namhangang.

505
00:38:58.990 --> 00:39:01.691
There was nobody else who shared
my interests, so I did it alone.

506
00:39:18.043 --> 00:39:19.727
It's a mockingbird.

507
00:39:20.284 --> 00:39:23.610
Probably a male who is making confident
movements to attract a female.

508
00:39:23.610 --> 00:39:27.499
It's sitting on a high branch and is
declaring ownership of its turf.

509
00:39:27.499 --> 00:39:30.015
I wanted to have these
sorts of conversations.

510
00:39:30.639 --> 00:39:33.775
Just like you, I wanted to
study birds in college

511
00:39:33.775 --> 00:39:36.086
and travel all over the world.

512
00:39:36.646 --> 00:39:38.265
But...

513
00:39:38.265 --> 00:39:39.914
I didn't have the courage.

514
00:39:41.126 --> 00:39:43.615
The courage to disappoint my parents.

515
00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:47.927
I'm still letting my
mother down, even now.

516
00:39:47.927 --> 00:39:51.347
Ms. Cha is quite proud of you, though.

517
00:39:52.709 --> 00:39:55.246
It's the result of
a desperate effort, on her part.

518
00:39:55.829 --> 00:39:56.988
Just look.

519
00:39:56.988 --> 00:39:59.044
I usually don't wear
these sorts of clothes.

520
00:39:59.044 --> 00:40:03.615
This is my mom's way of
asserting her dominance over me.

521
00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:22.227
<i>Mooryung Police Station, which is

527
00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:43.452
When people ask me why I like birds

528
00:40:43.452 --> 00:40:45.981
I've never been able to provide them
with a proper answer.

529
00:40:46.534 --> 00:40:50.101
So I've always wanted to meet someone
I didn't need to explain this to...

530

Please stop right over there.

531

Over there?

532
00:40:53.595 --> 00:40:54.756
Yes.

Thanks to you, I was able
to get here comfortably.

534
00:41:15.396 --> 00:41:18.095
I did drop you off,
but the ride seemed so short.

535
00:41:19.517 --> 00:41:21.006
Please get home safely.

536
00:41:21.006 --> 00:41:22.124

Yoon Bok!

I'm sorry.

That person isn't your mom.

00:43:30.988 --> 00:43:32.758
And you're not Hye Na, either.

571

You're Yoon Bok.

572
00:43:34.807 --> 00:43:36.805

take away Yoon Bok's mom, too?

575
00:43:52.575 --> 00:43:58.159
<i>There have been no leads in identifying
the location of the missing child.</i>

576
00:43:58.159 --> 00:44:01.630
<i>And amidst all this, it has been revealed
that Ms. Shin, her mother, abused her.</i>

577
00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:05.291
<i>So many people are
wondering if her mother</i>

578

<i>had something to do

<i>The police found an alibi for the
mother during the investigation</i>

580
00:44:12.611 --> 00:44:15.394
<i>so it'll be difficult to
prove that her abuse was</i>

581
00:44:15.394 --> 00:44:18.101
<i>linked to the child's
disappearance, won't it?</i>

582
00:44:18.101 --> 00:44:20.999
<i>Yes, but if this had been
planned beforehand</i>

583
00:44:20.999 --> 00:44:22.898
<i>the situation will
become more complicated.</i>

584
00:44:33.303 --> 00:44:34.901
Damn it.

585
00:44:51.146 --> 00:44:52.941
Yoon Bok, are you okay...

586
00:44:53.325 --> 00:44:54.332
Oh my gosh.

587
00:44:54.332 --> 00:44:55.570
You're burning up!

588
00:45:02.365 --> 00:45:03.660
Look at how much you're sweating!

589
00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:04.760
Yoon Bok.

590
00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:06.881
Can you hear me? Huh?

591
00:45:06.881 --> 00:45:08.639
Answer me if you can hear me.

592
00:45:08.639 --> 00:45:10.486
Okay? Yoon Bok.

593
00:45:17.930 --> 00:45:19.793
I'm calling from Suite 816.

594
00:45:19.793 --> 00:45:22.653
Do you have any fever-relieving medicine?

595
00:45:23.177 --> 00:45:25.637
No, it's fine.
We don't need to go to the hospital.

596
00:45:29.323 --> 00:45:30.463
Oh gosh, what do I do now?

597
00:45:30.463 --> 00:45:31.907
Get it together.
Get it together.

598
00:45:55.227 --> 00:45:57.251
Hello, this is Kang Soo Jin.

599
00:46:02.847 --> 00:46:03.877
Um...

600
00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:10.425
Seven years old?
Eight years old?

601
00:46:10.425 --> 00:46:12.359
She just turned nine.

602
00:46:12.359 --> 00:46:13.847
- Her clothes, please.
- Sure.

603
00:46:19.660 --> 00:46:20.696
What's her name?

604
00:46:21.207 --> 00:46:23.216
It's Yoon Bok.
Kim Yoon Bok.

605
00:46:23.216 --> 00:46:24.350
Yoon Bok.

606
00:46:26.595 --> 00:46:28.459
- Can you sit her up?
- Yes.

607
00:46:39.412 --> 00:46:40.528
All done.

608
00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:48.372
Yoon Bok.

609
00:46:48.372 --> 00:46:50.600
Say "Ah," Yoon Bok.

610
00:46:52.330 --> 00:46:54.856
Open wide. Good job.

611
00:47:00.428 --> 00:47:01.843
It's inflamed.

612
00:47:01.843 --> 00:47:03.388
She has laryngitis.

613
00:47:04.162 --> 00:47:05.720
Since when has she been unwell?

614
00:47:06.292 --> 00:47:08.495
She's been coughing
since yesterday afternoon

615
00:47:08.495 --> 00:47:10.655
and she vomited once before bed.

616
00:47:12.421 --> 00:47:15.126
Her larynx is badly swollen.

617
00:47:15.126 --> 00:47:17.934
If it gets any more swollen,
she may have to go to the ER.

618
00:47:18.964 --> 00:47:20.995
You must take her to
the hospital tomorrow.

619
00:47:22.039 --> 00:47:23.225
Do you understand?

620
00:47:30.472 --> 00:47:32.530
Please fill the tub with hot water.

621
00:47:44.751 --> 00:47:46.754
Is she conscious?

622
00:47:47.289 --> 00:47:49.051
It's because she has a high fever.

623
00:47:49.051 --> 00:47:52.711
Her fever would go down and her coughs
would become less severe after 30 minutes

624
00:47:52.711 --> 00:47:55.089
but, um, the air in the room is too dry.

625
00:47:55.562 --> 00:47:57.999
Go to the front desk
and ask for a humidifier.

626
00:47:57.999 --> 00:47:59.151
All right.

627
00:48:00.984 --> 00:48:02.986
All right, there we go.

628
00:48:10.059 --> 00:48:11.296
Mom.

629
00:48:15.044 --> 00:48:16.327
Yoon Bok.

630
00:48:17.042 --> 00:48:18.397
Are you conscious now?

631
00:48:23.039 --> 00:48:25.044
Can you say your name?

632
00:48:26.182 --> 00:48:27.843
What is your name?

633
00:48:31.519 --> 00:48:33.120
Kim Hye Na.

634
00:48:35.868 --> 00:48:37.870
Can you... repeat your
name for me...

635
00:48:37.870 --> 00:48:38.897
Yoon Bok?

636
00:48:40.571 --> 00:48:42.006
Kim Hye Na.

637
00:48:47.419 --> 00:48:49.048
What about your mom's name?

638
00:48:49.941 --> 00:48:51.934
Shin Ja Young.

639
00:49:04.573 --> 00:49:07.120
This could turn into
acute bronchitis or pneumonia

640
00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:08.711
so you must take her
to the hospital.

641
00:49:12.591 --> 00:49:15.312
Is there... a reason why you
can't take her to the hospital?

642
00:49:19.613 --> 00:49:21.584
Come to my hospital and
pick up medicine for her.

643
00:49:21.584 --> 00:49:24.584
And make sure to give her all of it.
I'll give you a call after three days.

644
00:49:26.267 --> 00:49:27.827
Thank you.

645
00:49:28.582 --> 00:49:30.801
This place isn't good for a young child.

646
00:49:31.450 --> 00:49:33.254
Can't you go to your mother's place?

647
00:49:37.705 --> 00:49:38.707
Oh.

648
00:49:38.707 --> 00:49:40.919
There are three rooms at my place.

649
00:49:40.919 --> 00:49:42.428
But I live alone.

650
00:49:42.899 --> 00:49:45.600
I leave early in the morning
and come home late at night.

651
00:49:46.464 --> 00:49:48.026
If you need me,
please give me a call.

652
00:49:49.926 --> 00:49:51.548
Um, Doctor.

653
00:49:58.055 --> 00:49:59.307
You're thankful, right?

654
00:50:02.144 --> 00:50:03.493
All right.

655
00:50:03.493 --> 00:50:05.120
Let's talk later.

656
00:50:34.986 --> 00:50:37.019
She's been sleeping for 20 hours now.

657
00:50:37.019 --> 00:50:39.397
I think she took a ton
of sleeping pills.

658
00:50:39.397 --> 00:50:42.459
We can't investigate her
if she's not fully conscious.

659
00:50:48.381 --> 00:50:50.559
<i>What about the man she lives with?
Did you locate him?</i>

660
00:50:50.559 --> 00:50:53.865
<i>He hasn't picked up his phone
since that day.</i>

661
00:51:16.993 --> 00:51:21.019
<i>[Samhwa Barber Shop]</i>

662
00:51:25.707 --> 00:51:26.984
Thank you.

663
00:51:39.164 --> 00:51:41.017
Is she... sick?

664
00:51:41.495 --> 00:51:44.908
I'm sorry, but please take care
of Yoon Bok for a bit.

665
00:52:15.528 --> 00:52:17.457
I finally know what that sound is.

666
00:52:17.939 --> 00:52:21.626
Jingle... jangle... jingle.

667
00:52:29.914 --> 00:52:30.977
This?

668
00:52:31.408 --> 00:52:34.513
I bet you always get caught
when you play hide-and-seek

669
00:52:34.513 --> 00:52:35.747
because of that sound.

670
00:52:45.030 --> 00:52:47.604
- Hello.
- Hello.

671
00:52:47.604 --> 00:52:48.908
You're here, Big Sis?

672
00:52:49.341 --> 00:52:50.519
Where's Mom?

673
00:52:50.986 --> 00:52:52.111
She's resting.

674
00:52:55.827 --> 00:52:58.053
She's resting since she's sick!

675
00:52:59.379 --> 00:53:00.743
Mom.

676
00:53:00.743 --> 00:53:01.756
Oh!

677
00:53:01.756 --> 00:53:03.004
You're here?

678
00:53:05.354 --> 00:53:06.990
This won't work.

679
00:53:07.568 --> 00:53:09.169
I definitely will
repay you your money.

680
00:53:09.169 --> 00:53:11.611
But I can't let you
treat me as you please...

681
00:53:12.091 --> 00:53:13.461
just because you lent me money.

682
00:53:13.461 --> 00:53:15.513
What are you talking about, Soo Jin?

683
00:53:15.513 --> 00:53:18.059
Say it clearly,
in a way that I'll understand.

684
00:53:19.573 --> 00:53:21.879
Wearing the clothes you like.

685
00:53:21.879 --> 00:53:24.687
Going on a date with
a man that you like.

686
00:53:24.687 --> 00:53:26.738
I did so much of that in the past.

687
00:53:28.361 --> 00:53:31.298
I said that I'd meet with you
to spend time with you

688
00:53:31.298 --> 00:53:34.227
not that I'd readjust my life
to suit you again.

689
00:53:34.934 --> 00:53:36.028
Big Sis.

690
00:53:40.019 --> 00:53:42.131
You're so selfish, Big Sis.

691
00:53:42.597 --> 00:53:44.102
You left without a word.

692
00:53:44.102 --> 00:53:46.140
Do you know how upset Mom was

693
00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:48.077
and how much she must
have missed you, that...

694
00:53:48.077 --> 00:53:49.872
even though she has cancer...

695
00:53:52.952 --> 00:53:55.472
someone like her,
who is so scared of hospitals

696
00:53:55.472 --> 00:53:57.959
got chemo and underwent
surgery by herself?

697
00:53:57.959 --> 00:54:01.388
And this time, her cancer relapsed,
and it's been so hard for all of us!

698
00:54:01.388 --> 00:54:02.955
And yet, you...

699
00:54:02.955 --> 00:54:05.077
went off and did
everything you wanted to...

700
00:54:05.077 --> 00:54:06.890
Go outside, Yi Jin.

701
00:54:06.890 --> 00:54:09.604
What did Mom do that was
so wrong, Big Sis?

702
00:54:09.604 --> 00:54:11.754
She's done so much for you!

703
00:54:11.754 --> 00:54:13.700
Yi Jin, go outside. Please.

704
00:54:22.368 --> 00:54:23.577
Mom.

705
00:54:24.794 --> 00:54:26.544
You have cancer?

706
00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:37.365
Why didn't you tell me?

707
00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:43.354
I didn't get cancer because of you.

708
00:54:44.323 --> 00:54:46.629
Remember how my mom passed
away because of breast cancer

709
00:54:46.629 --> 00:54:48.537
when I was a second year in high school?

710
00:54:51.513 --> 00:54:53.888
I was so angry then.

711
00:54:54.390 --> 00:54:56.537
I felt as if she'd
left me behind on purpose.

712
00:54:57.568 --> 00:55:00.350
And after that,
I was determined to never get cancer.

713
00:55:00.995 --> 00:55:02.457
In case you girls would get mad.

714
00:55:07.537 --> 00:55:08.955
Soo Jin.

715
00:55:10.655 --> 00:55:12.370
I knew you'd come back.

716
00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:18.193
That's why I bravely underwent chemo and
got surgery by myself, seven years ago.

717
00:55:18.193 --> 00:55:20.519
So that I could be healthy
when I welcomed you back.

718
00:55:21.671 --> 00:55:24.321
But then, I heard that
it had relapsed, and...

719
00:55:25.823 --> 00:55:27.484
I got a bit scared.

720
00:55:32.042 --> 00:55:34.903
I had no idea
where in the world you were

721
00:55:34.903 --> 00:55:38.010
and whether you were even alive or dead.

722
00:55:39.214 --> 00:55:42.147
And I was scared that
I'd die here, all alone.

723
00:55:44.522 --> 00:55:45.711
Mom.

724
00:55:48.990 --> 00:55:50.687
Will you stay with me?

725
00:55:59.466 --> 00:56:01.048
Mom, I...

726
00:56:01.048 --> 00:56:02.173
Must you go?

727
00:56:12.124 --> 00:56:14.874
Can't you at least meet with me
10 times before you leave again?

728
00:56:25.321 --> 00:56:27.024
Also, you...

729
00:56:27.484 --> 00:56:30.062
don't usually care
about the clothes you wear.

730
00:56:30.591 --> 00:56:33.269
So what's so wrong about you
wearing the clothes I buy for you?

731
00:56:33.269 --> 00:56:35.506
Also, about Doctor Jung.

732
00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:38.716
He definitely isn't the
type of guy that I like.

733
00:56:39.609 --> 00:56:41.859
He's the type of guy who spends
seven days a week at the hospital

734
00:56:41.859 --> 00:56:43.821
and eats all three of his meals
per day at the hospital.

735
00:56:43.821 --> 00:56:46.046
Are you afraid that I'll try to
set you up with him?

736
00:56:49.765 --> 00:56:52.658
I'm going to pretend that
I didn't hear what you said before

737
00:56:52.658 --> 00:56:54.839
about repaying the money and such.

738
00:56:55.526 --> 00:56:57.468
I'm tired, so get going now.

739
00:56:57.468 --> 00:57:00.370
And don't count today among the 10
days I have. That wouldn't be fair.

<i>But...</i>

742
00:57:11.022 --> 00:57:12.053
no matter how much I think about it

743
00:57:12.053 --> 00:57:14.466
I don't think the child
went there to die.

744
00:57:14.466 --> 00:57:17.044
Look at her pace and her movements.

745
00:57:17.044 --> 00:57:19.781
Don't you think that she'd be smiling
if we could see her face?

746
00:57:20.481 --> 00:57:22.537
You're letting your emotions
cloud your judgment.

747
00:57:22.537 --> 00:57:26.651
Nobody wants to see a child
walking toward her death, after all.

748
00:57:27.437 --> 00:57:32.283
To me, it looks like Hye Na
is saying her final farewell.

749
00:57:32.283 --> 00:57:35.339
Like she's saying,
"Bye, you guys. Take care."

750
00:57:35.339 --> 00:57:36.430
Like this.

751
00:57:36.430 --> 00:57:38.126
9 times out of 10, in cases like this

752
00:57:38.126 --> 00:57:41.720
the case is closed with the body
of the child being discovered.

753
00:57:42.220 --> 00:57:45.055
But I just can't give up on the
possibility of that 10 percent chance.

754
00:57:45.055 --> 00:57:46.624
For example.

755
00:57:46.624 --> 00:57:51.769
The lady living next door or a teacher
from her school could've taken her away.

756
00:57:51.769 --> 00:57:52.850
Maybe...

757
00:57:52.850 --> 00:57:56.115
someone like that teacher
who is a bird researcher.

758
00:57:56.115 --> 00:57:57.984
You mean the temporary homeroom teacher?

759
00:57:57.984 --> 00:58:00.214
She's definitely not the type
to do such a thing!

760
00:58:00.214 --> 00:58:02.872
She has no interest in
other people's problems.

761
00:58:02.872 --> 00:58:04.539
And she hates kids, too.

762
00:58:06.691 --> 00:58:07.885
Really?

I didn't take you to be
this kind of person
