24
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.870
She definitely fell here!

She definitely died, but she's gone again!

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.550
I think I caused him to get hurt!

31
00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.540
Ultimately,

32
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.090
you made him like that.

33
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.320
I'm sorry.

34
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.430
Don't say anything and stay still.

35
00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.610
Are you okay?

36
00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.810
I'm not someone who should be getting consoled by a mutilated zombie.

37
00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.040
Just be quiet.

38
00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.470
Let's just for a moment

39
00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.120
stay put quietly.

40
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.700
Are you hurt?

41
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.390
I'm not hurt, I'm just surprised.

42
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:11.620
Stop chattering and stay still. After I calm down, I'll treat you too.

43
00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.060
<i>Don't! Stop, Son Oh Gong!</i>

44
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.520
<i>Don't! Don't! Don't!</i>

45
00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.240
Is the Great Sage going to die in the hands of Sam Jang?

46
00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.400
It seems she will really kill me.

47
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.940
<i>[Episode 12]</i>

48
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.430
What happened to Son Oh Gong all of a sudden?

49
00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:05.100
Since you ordered him to stop, and he went against it,

50
00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.420
the pain in his heart seems to have intensified.

51
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.520
Even if there was an occasion where he was hurt because of me,

52
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.800
that was because he was hurt emotionally. I never caused him to be physically injured.

53
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.760
And isn't he really strong?

54
00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.210
You said there's nothing that can hurt him!

55
00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:28.260
I did say that, but now the Great Sage can be injured.

56
00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.520
- You had made him that way.
- I did?

57
00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.730
Because of the Geumganggo. To say it simply,

58
00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:37.360
his love for you

59
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.300
made the stone-hearted monkey's heart go soft.

60
00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.550
Then, because of the Geumganggo, he became weak?

61
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:52.080
He ended up having a fatal weakness. He could die from it. Of course,

62
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.660
what can kill him

63
00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.230
is only the one he loves,

64
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.760
which is you.

65
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:08.370
I can possibly kill him?

66
00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:29.890
It's all healed now. Son Oh Gong, thank you.

67
00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:33.650
Drink it, it will also relax you.

68
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:38.820
This is really precious. I'm really letting you live in luxury.

69
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.120
Is this place Sureumdong?

70
00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.340
Yeah, this is my home.

71
00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:03.260
Where is Unnie?

72
00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:07.420
She's probably also surprised somewhere.

73
00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:10.740
<i>What's the matter? Are you hurt?</i>

74
00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:21.510
Unnie is feeling sad.

75
00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:24.970
I know very well how she feels because she and I are connected.

76
00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:29.710
She is very sad.

77
00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:36.620
Zombie, if you continue talking, the wound which I barely patched up will open up again. Be quiet.

78
00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:42.280
I'm not just "Zombie" anymore. I found my name.

79
00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:47.860
My name is Jeong Se Ra.

80
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:51.300
Isn't my name quite pretty?

81
00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.410
It's not that pretty,

82
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.110
Miss Jeong Se Ra.

83
00:07:56.110 --> 00:08:00.370
I also want to tell Jeo Pal Gye that I found out my name.

84
00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.300
Indeed. Pal Gye is your hyung.

85
00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.130
Yes, I have to hurry and see him.

86
00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:11.400
You too should go out to see Unnie.

87
00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:21.890
Zombie Jin Bu Ja was really annoying but Miss Jeong Se Ra is also quite bothersome.

88
00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:24.740
Let's go out together, Son Oh Gong.

89
00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:30.500
All right. Let's go, Miss Jeong Se Ra.

90
00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.600
What now?

91
00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:53.270
Later, please burn me here at Sureumdong.

92
00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.680
I'd like it to be here.

93
00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.260
Will you do that?

94
00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:08.300
I'll give you a luxurious send-off.

95
00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:11.720
Thank you.

96
00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:18.510
Where on earth is Bu Ja? I can't get in touch with her either.

97
00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:23.320
According to my oppa, she left after saying goodbye like a person going on a very long trip.

98
00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:27.910
For some reason, I'm feeling uneasy. You don't think anything will happen, right?

99
00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:30.370
It was kind of weird when she said goodbye.

100
00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:33.730
Oh. I should have just tagged along.

101
00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:37.220
Zombie is already dead so even if she wants to, she can't die.

102
00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:39.670
Unless you burn her with strong energy.

103
00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:42.430
She said she was going somewhere with the Great Sage.

104
00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:47.930
By chance, he isn't burning Bu Ja, is he?

105
00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:55.480
Is he that worried about Zombie?

106
00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:59.650
How did the pig get so into the zombie?

107
00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:03.240
Are you jealous now, Prince?

108
00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:09.340
How did an octopus get attracted to a pig?

109
00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:25.700
<i>Jeo Pal Gye. I am most grateful to you.</i>

110
00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:29.400
<i>It was nice of you to say you were my younger brother.</i>

111
00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:44.120
- Bu Ja!
- Jeo Pal Gye-nim.

112
00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:48.620
What a relief. You scared me.

113
00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:51.340
I'm fine.

114
00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:55.030
I couldn't contact you. I really thought something happened

115
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:57.020
so I was about to crash into 5050.

116
00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:02.290
Jeo Pal Gye-nim, I found my name.

117
00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:04.400
Really?

118
00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:08.200
Jeong Se Ra called her mother's cell phone.

119
00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:12.510
After those two tried to handle it by themselves, it seems they ran away.

120
00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:19.070
That, that's not it. The dead girl is dead again. This time too, she disappeared.

121
00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:24.030
- Y-y-yes.
- He keeps saying weird things like that.

122
00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:29.060
You say she called her mother's cell phone?

123
00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:32.190
Then call her on the cell phone.

124
00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:37.030
If she isn't dead this time, she'll show up alive again.

125
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:49.640
- Excuse me but...- Hyungnim isn't in at the moment.

126
00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:51.250
I think he might be in Sureomdong..

127
00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:53.360
Do you think you can take me over there?

128
00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:58.610
If you want to go meet with him then you can contact Samjang, can't you?

129
00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:02.610
I won't be able to do that since I'm afraid that he might get hurt.

130
00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:09.150
Nobody is able to go into the place in Sureomdong unless he calls for it.

131
00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:11.200
I'm so sorry.

132
00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:15.910
Suremdong.

133
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:21.330
I know the way over there but I don't know the way to get in.

134
00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:30.220
Please let me in. Let's have a chit chat.

135
00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.910
What should I do?

136
00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:07.190
Hey.

137
00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.620
Does it hurt?

138
00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:22.680
I was super hurt earlier because of you.

139
00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.160
We are even now.

140
00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:45.870
You know, you always told me not to come up with any schemes

141
00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:48.780
but you have a tendency to start stuff.

142
00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:58.060
Being hurt seems to have a purpose.

143
00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:19.200
It's a warm tea so go ahead and drink some. You like warm things, don't you?

144
00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.080
Hey, are you hungry?

145
00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:30.640
-Do you want me to get you something to eat?
- Nah, I'm fine.

146
00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:34.890
Hey, would you like me to get you some fruit then?

147
00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:38.570
Why are you constantly saying, "Hey" instead of saying honey?

148
00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:40.550
When you say, "Hey", who are you referring to?

149
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:47.230
I'm not saying your name because I don't want you to be hurt by it.

150
00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:51.540
You were feeling hurt when I called you by your name earlier.

151
00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:58.830
So, you're not gonna call me by my name ever again?

152
00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:05.560
Oh so, you want to break our contract then?

153
00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.680
So are you gonna help me take off my golden bracelet then?

154
00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:14.860
- Do you want me to take it off for you?
- Seriously?

155
00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:42.520
I can't do this.

156
00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:46.080
I still need you and I would have to constantly call on you.

157
00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:48.730
You said that you came to really like me

158
00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:52.380
but I guess you don't like me that much since you don't want to help me take off this bracelet.

159

Do you think Son Oh Gong would let her know that it's the Death Bell instead of the Love Bell?

176
00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:28.310
If Sam Jang mistook it as the Love Bell

177
00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:32.120
and keeps on falling in love with Son Oh Gong. it will be more advantageous for him.

178
00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:35.140
He's never going to tell her, ever.

179
00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:39.810
Don't you think he won't be able to say anything since he doesn't want her to be heartbroken for expecting it to be the Love Bell?

180
00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:41.590
Son Oh Gong is a mean little bastard, you know.

181
00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:43.710
He would never lose when it comes to love.

182
00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:48.690
Ma Wang, it looks like you're cheering for Son Oh Gong not to die since he's such a mean little bastard.

183
00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:50.810
Why are you making me into his ally huh?

184
00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:52.500
I freaking hate that punk.

185
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.570
I really hate him.

186
00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:56.700
Yes, Ma Wang.

187
00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:59.920
Using her sense of duty, Son Oh Gong

188
00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:04.370
will bewitch Sam Jang more and more.

189
00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:06.770
It's because he's a punk, that's why.

190
00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:25.300
He told me to throw him out in the ocean because he hates him so much.

191
00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:31.110
Hyungnim, this is a bit creepy.

192
00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:39.530
My name is Jeong Se Ra.

193
00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:44.240
Jeong Se Ra? Wow, you have such a pretty name.

194
00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:47.300
Man, I gave you such a tacky name asJin Bu Ja.

195
00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:48.680
And now this piggy feels so embarrassed for that.

196
00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:52.260
Jin Bu Ja was also great. Bu Ja is so blessed.

197
00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:53.980
It's the best indeed.

198
00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:58.860
Jeo Pal Gye, you can continue to remember me and think of me as Bu Ja as long as you want.

199
00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:02.130
I will continue to be your younger brother, Jin Bu Ja.

200
00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:06.800
Sure, I will continue to be your Jin Bu Ja, just for you.

- What's wrong?
- I think it's because I put my arm back together after my it fell off earlier today.

I'm alright now

203

I put aside some life preservatives for you earlier today, let me go bring you some.

Nobody is here.

220
00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:27.100
Sa Oh Jeong obviously knows that I like porridge.

221

But he will never make it for me ever.

This kid knows nothing about cleaning for goodness sake.

What if this gets in the way of work?

226
00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:58.140
Bu Ja isn't here so there is no way Pal Gye will be there either.

227
00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:02.560
I guess the Jade Dragon won't be coming either.

228
00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:11.570
Let's see here.

229
00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:16.490
Darn it.

230
00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:22.650
Ma Wang, you're home.

231
00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:31.450
Why are you here so late?

232
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:35.610
Did you clean up the place?

233
00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:40.160
Yeah, I haven't been here in awhile and now the house is such a mess.

234
00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:42.440
I've been hospitalized and now I'm finally home

235
00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:44.430
and I see this house in such a mess, you should've cleaned it up a little.

236
00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:47.030
Oh Jeong has been so busy with the shareholders meeting so there was no chance to keep up the house.

237
00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:49.530
Is this Oh Jeong's house or something?

238
00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:53.540
You don't even know how to differentiate regular trash from food and drink trash huh?

239
00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:56.080
I put the house under too

240
00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:58.500
but you still don't even want to contribute in anyway whatsoever, don't ya?

241
00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:00.910
Ma Wang., congratulations for being discharged.

242
00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:05.330
What's all this?

243
00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:08.070
This is porridge, which is your favorite.

244
00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:11.070
I don't know how to make it so I bought it. And here's your congratulatory wine.

245
00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:15.070
Oh, you bought some porridge for me, eh?

246
00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:16.830
You bought mushroom porridge which I really like.

247
00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:18.080
Yup, I heard that this porridge place makes delicious porridge.

248
00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:20.900
Eat this while I go out to take out the trash.

249
00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:23.510
And have some wine while you're at it too.

250
00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:27.100
You didn't put anything strange in here right?

251
00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:29.760
Right? Seriously for goodness sake.

252
00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:35.880
It looks like you added some mushrooms in here after all.

253
00:23:55.210 --> 00:23:57.920
- You should come and sit down here, too. Let's eat together.
- Me, too?

254
00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:01.500
I mean, you almost died too after all.

255
00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:05.310
Ma Wang, are you being thoughtful of me?

256
00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:11.400
Come on, I'm worried you put something weird in here so I'm sharing it with you.

257
00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:14.120
I didn't put anything in it. Nothing!

258
00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:16.400
You're so full of fears.

259
00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:21.300
Looks good.

260
00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:27.080
Did you tell Sam Jang about the Death Bell?

261
00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:31.540
Why? Are you worried because you think I might die? Scared of being left alone?

262
00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:35.400
Forget it. Just stuff yourself with the porridge.

263
00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:40.120
Ah, I heard from Sam Jang that you caught an evil spirit attached to a tree today.

264
00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:43.730
That's right. She took care of it all with Secretary Ma.

265
00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:46.260
That really was an evil spirit, right?

266
00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:49.570
You didn't accidentally mess with something else?

267
00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:54.510
Hey, because I have to clean up the shit I made by releasing you I'm suffering like this right now.

268
00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:56.970
Do you think I'd make shit again? Am I some kind of shit-maker?

269
00:24:56.970 --> 00:24:59.410
Right? Surely, you wouldn't have made shit again.

270
00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:00.820
Exactly.

271
00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:02.700
Nothing's going to happen.

272
00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:29.660
I didn't think you'd actually come, but I see you're here.

273
00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:32.240
I guess you're fearless since you don't die.

274
00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:36.330
Were you the person that killed me?

275
00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:39.950
I'm sorry. That was an accident.

276
00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:42.770
My death was an accident?

277
00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:46.990
How are you still alive though?

278
00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:49.420
That's really intriguing.

279
00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:52.860
Where is my mother?

280
00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:56.900
I asked a question but you're answering with another question.

281
00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:58.140
I hate that.

282
00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:00.520
Help me meet with my mother.

283
00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:04.700
And it looks like you have no intention of answering me either.

284
00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:07.880
But even so, I'll be nice and answer you.

285
00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:13.870
She's over there.

286
00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:18.960
Over there?

287
00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:24.860
Open this up!

288
00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:27.100
Please open it!

289
00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:29.240
Throw her into the sea together with the coffin.

290
00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:32.320
- Then she won't be able to come back again.
- Open this up!

291
00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:37.050
Please open this!

292
00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:40.480
Please open it!

00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:45.410
Open this up!

294
00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:53.410
What the heck?

295
00:28:53.410 --> 00:28:55.120
What's going on?

296
00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:01.020
What the heck is this?

297
00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:02.780
Now what's happening?

298
00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:08.590
Go in and check it out.

299
00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:48.780
What are you?

300
00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:53.970
You all are going to have to become a sacrificial offering for me.

301
00:30:32.150 --> 00:30:34.280
Now what's this?

302
00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:36.850
<i>[Lucifer Entertainment]</i>

303
00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:43.200
It looks like you woke up a real headache-inducer yesterday.

304
00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:48.400
So you're saying the thing that was sealed under that tree

305
00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:53.300
was an Ah Sa Nyeo that had been resting there for over 1,000 years?

306
00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:55.880
Ah Sa Nyeo? What's that?

307
00:30:55.880 --> 00:31:00.780
A shaman that served a king. She was sealed after dying.

308
00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:05.730
If it's an evil spirit that's been around over 1,000 years, I imagine it will be worth quite a lot of points.

309
00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:10.820
- Oh. Ma Wang, how many points do you still need? You're keeping track, right?
- Of course I am.

310
00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:13.580
You have to do it right. You're always trying to con me.

311
00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:19.290
Ah Sa Nyeo is not something you can take lightly.

312
00:31:19.290 --> 00:31:23.850
Unlike an evil spirit, if she hides in a human you won't be able to tell the difference.

313
00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:28.790
She can use a human by controlling their mind.

314
00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:37.590
It's a shaman that has the ability to even wake a dragon and create a king.

315
00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:43.130
If something were to go wrong, it's possible she could turn the whole world upside down.

316
00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:45.800
So Ma Wang woke up a huge problem.

317
00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:49.550
Hey, why is that my fault? Sam Jang was the one that did it.

318
00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:51.610
Why are you pushing that onto Sam Jang?

319
00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:55.960
You set that evil spirit free just like how you set me free. Ma Wang should lose points then.

320
00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:59.020
Hey, why should my points be taken away! Have you no idea what I went through to get them!

321
00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:04.590
This isn't the time to be pointing fingers at each other.

322
00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:08.290
At any rate, Ma Wang started this business

323
00:32:08.290 --> 00:32:11.370
so find the Ah Sa Nyeo, Ma Wang.

324
00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:21.110
Because of the side effects of the medicine that was suppressing my strength,

325
00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:24.630
I still need to recuperate.

326
00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:28.170
It hasn't been long since I came back to life.

327
00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:34.670
I think that will be difficult. Please give me a break.

328
00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:39.060
Then, Great Sage, you should go find and take care of it.

329
00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:41.990
Why's this acting up again? Ow...

330
00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:43.440
I'm dying!!

331
00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:45.440
Don't you know that my heart has gone all soft.

332
00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:47.940
Ever since then, I get heart attacks often.

333
00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:50.270
Ohh, my heart...

334
00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:52.280
I have to take medicine to endure it.

335
00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:54.770
Just watch me. Watch.

336
00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:57.070
Hey, these are breath mints.

337
00:32:57.070 --> 00:32:59.820
Oh? You're not coughing. You must be fine.

338
00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:02.190
You two!

339
00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:06.440
Enough with trying to get out of it.

340
00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:13.580
I'll have to discuss with the rest of the heavenly realm how to handle Ah Sa Nyeo.

341
00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:20.130
Ugh, really now...

342
00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:23.930
Why did you have to go and wake that thing up! I clearly asked you about it!

343
00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:27.870
And you went and said it was nothing! How could a bull be so careless.

344
00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:30.350
Ugh, seriously!

345
00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:32.120
Hey, stop that!

346
00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:33.610
You stupid bull!

347
00:33:33.610 --> 00:33:35.540
Don't! Don't do that!

348
00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:38.090
- Stop it!
- This stupid bull. Sheesh.

349
00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:41.860
Hey, it was thanks to my carelessness that you were set free from the Five Elements Mountain, wasn't it?

350
00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:45.980
You ungrateful thug.

351
00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:52.590
Anyway, don't call Sam Jang for something so dangerous and clean up your own shit.

352
00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:55.120
You're the first shit that I made.

353
00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:59.500
I see Shit Number 1 has the gall to criticize Shit Number 2. Really...

354
00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:02.340
At any rate, avoiding shit is the best thing to do. I'm going to stay away from it.

355
00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:04.950
It woke up from Sam Jang's blood.

356
00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:07.230
Ah Sa Nyeo is going to go after Sam Jang

357
00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:09.540
and, in the end, that shit

358
00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:13.840
is going to be yours to clean up! You monkey banana.

359
00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:22.280
Stop spitting! Are you out of your mind!

360
00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:31.750
Oh? This tree is...

361
00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:33.280
<i>[Korea Foundation in Icheon City, Large-scale Culture and Art Space is Being Built]</i>

362
00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:35.260
It came out in the press.

363
00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:39.950
CEO, you plan on buying land in Icheon? Good choice!

364
00:34:39.950 --> 00:34:41.650
Is the land price for this going up?

365
00:34:41.650 --> 00:34:46.360
Of course. That entire area is owned by the Korea Foundation.

366
00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:50.320
That professor, Kang Dae Seong. His family is the Korea Foundation.

367
00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:54.100
He's from the most prestigious family, smart, and handsome.

368
00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:57.760
My wife likes him even more than idols.

369
00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:02.870
If he becomes president, it will be awesome for the city of Icheon.

370
00:35:04.850 --> 00:35:07.010
So he's a really impressive person.

371
00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:11.750
By the way, are the roads icy or something? Why's the Jajjangmyeon taking so long?

372
00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:23.190
Huh? Why's that girl looking up here? Does she want to rent a room?

373
00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:25.440
Ugh, I'm so hungry...

374
00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:31.420
That girl is in there. Shall I say hi?

375
00:35:41.444 --> 00:35:46.444
<font color="#80ffff">[Viki Ver] E12 A Korean Odyssey (Hwayugi)</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

376
00:35:58.170 --> 00:36:00.330
Who sent them?

377
00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:13.400
Did Jonathan send them?

378
00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:15.150
As I expect he is a romantic.

379
00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:18.720
My friend, my Jonathan.

380
00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:22.760
CEO, I will get you a vase. Please leave them on the desk.

381
00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:24.540
When was it stolen?

382
00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:54.720
Tasty.

383
00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:05.480
Hey? Did your hyung take it?

384
00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:22.010
I see she likes flowers.

385
00:39:23.330 --> 00:39:25.520
Does he know it?

386
00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:32.640
During Su Bo Ri's journey to the celestial realm, you will become the Taoist monk's substitute.

387
00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:35.990
If I understand the substitute's job well, I can do the work.

388
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:38.230
I'm sure I will earn more points.

389
00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:43.730
The work you'll do today ...you're going to bring down divine retribution upon a human.

390
00:39:43.730 --> 00:39:45.110
<i>Police Report</i>

391
00:39:45.110 --> 00:39:48.890
He's done evil things.

392
00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:53.840
When it is informed, they say that heaven is not indifferent. There is nothing like divine retribution.

393
00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:56.340
But now a days, punishment is so rare.

394
00:39:56.400 --> 00:40:03.500
When I become a god, I'm just going to let the chips fall where they may.

395
00:40:05.450 --> 00:40:08.650
Oh! The one who is doomed has arrived there.

396
00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:11.310
Really.

397
00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:15.400
That wretched dude.

398
00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:23.750
Excuse me.

399
00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:29.450
Could you hand me your cellphone for a second?

400
00:40:29.450 --> 00:40:31.830
What the heck?

401
00:40:34.830 --> 00:40:36.410
What the hell are you doing?

402
00:40:36.410 --> 00:40:40.040
You bastard Jo Sae Pal, scammed 23,600 people

403
00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:42.480
out of 1.35 trillion won, didn't you?

404
00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:47.180
Ninety-nine people committed suicide because of you and 2,600 orphans were created.

405
00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:50.560
7,856 households were broken.

406
00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:56.190
You murderous bastard were happy and overjoyed that you escaped human punishment.

407
00:40:56.190 --> 00:41:04.790
So today you will receive the wrath which heaven brings down.

408
00:41:08.530 --> 00:41:11.100
After falling down here today, you won't die.

409
00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:13.520
even though all of your limbs are broken you won't die and

410
00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:16.050
after surviving for 9 days you'll be rescued.

411
00:41:16.050 --> 00:41:20.570
Even if you breathe, you will suffer agony in all of your joints.

412
00:41:20.570 --> 00:41:25.050
And live like that for the rest of your life.

413
00:41:25.050 --> 00:41:29.150
Now you must fall.

414
00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:36.450
I-I-I was wrong.

415
00:41:36.450 --> 00:41:38.180
P-p-please spare me.

416
00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:41.330
Because to spare some one like you,

417
00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:44.860
there would be talk that heaven is indifferent.

418
00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:47.730
Here! Go!

419
00:41:47.730 --> 00:41:49.980
Sp-sp-spare me

420
00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:57.140
Bastard.

421
00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:06.720
Ma Wang, carrying out retribution work is very gratifying.

422
00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:10.980
It wouldn't do for the sort of human to keep popping up.

423
00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:13.340
In any case, when I become a deity

424
00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:17.980
I can become officially involved in human affairs.

425
00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:51.620
<i>That woman</i>

426
00:42:53.970 --> 00:42:57.130
<i>where in the world now has she been born?</i>

427
00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:09.800
<i>That woman... where in the world now has she been born?</i>

428
00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:15.460
Na Chal

429
00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:17.670
You can't, Ma Hwang.

430
00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:20.750
You know you must never become involved.

431
00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:23.230
Even if the Devil is involved, it doesn't prevent a tragic death

432
00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:26.180
and there will be an even worse misfortune in the next life.

433
00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:03.230
You're back, President.

434
00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:05.760
I just got back. You worked hard Eun Ji.

435
00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:08.100
Yes. Work hard.

436
00:44:55.410 --> 00:44:57.220
Who are you?

437
00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:04.010
- Ah. It's Bu Ja.
- Ma Wang.

438
00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:09.730
Why have you come here?

439
00:45:09.730 --> 00:45:11.570
I have been eating the energy beads.

440
00:45:11.570 --> 00:45:15.340
I heard that you fell from a high location.

441
00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:17.230
Take the beads and leave.

442
00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:19.590
Thank you, Ma Wang.

443
00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:27.910
Have you found the beautiful Sinsan?

444
00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:36.980
I've told you everything about her.

445
00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:39.710
Actually, today

446
00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:45.080
I might have seen her.

447
00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:50.310
In this life too she was beaten down and crying.

448
00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:58.000
You said you couldn't interfere with her fate becoming a human.

449
00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:02.730
That's right.

450
00:46:05.130 --> 00:46:11.090
Can I help you?

451
00:46:11.090 --> 00:46:16.520
I am not existing as a human, a goblin or a ghost.

452
00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:22.120
If I interfere in such a status, might heaven not be aware?

453
00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:28.910
How did you come up with that idea?

454
00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:33.660
I told you I was hoping I could do something for you.

455
00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:41.160
However, deceiving the heavens is not easy.

456
00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:45.070
I've beyond my time.

457
00:46:45.070 --> 00:46:48.250
Then, please relax for now.

458
00:47:06.740 --> 00:47:10.180
Ma Wang gave me the energy beads.

459
00:47:12.790 --> 00:47:14.460
Bu Ja?

460
00:47:17.070 --> 00:47:20.430
You're emitting an unfamiliar scent.

461
00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:30.950
I've changed the scent which masks the rotting smell.

462
00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:34.940
It's the scent of roses. It's not bad.

463
00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:52.210
Bu Ja! Where did you go?

464
00:47:52.210 --> 00:47:56.760
Are you going to keep making me worried by going off the radar and disappearing like this?

465
00:47:57.670 --> 00:48:01.820
Pig, we're on our way to our couple photo shoot right now.

466
00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:05.880
If you keep acting like this there won't be a break-up article!

467
00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:07.780
Why, you!

468
00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:14.710
I'll be going straight home once my schedule is finished so stay right at home. Got it?

469
00:48:27.490 --> 00:48:30.830
This Bu Ja girl was quite loved.

470
00:48:31.930 --> 00:48:35.060
But even so, rather than this zombie,

471
00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:38.150
it would be better to steal Sam Jang's body.

472
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.260
It's Son Oh Gong.

473
00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:51.660
Hey, zombie!

474
00:48:52.310 --> 00:48:54.550
- Son Oh Gong
- Are you on your way back from seeing Ma Wang?

475
00:48:54.550 --> 00:48:57.670
Yes. He gave me energy beads.

476
00:48:58.630 --> 00:49:00.040
He did?

477
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:04.160
What's wrong?

478
00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:08.370
I feel like I fixed up a girl that was ripped to shreds way too well.

479
00:49:08.370 --> 00:49:13.930
You probably don't need energy beads. I'm the that needs a pick-me-up. Me. Give them here.

480
00:49:13.930 --> 00:49:19.560
If I've graced you with that much luxury then you should at least pay up this much, right? I'm going.

481
00:49:23.410 --> 00:49:24.800
Hey!

482
00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:38.600
I picked it up off the road on my way here.

483
00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:44.760
You like flowers, don't you? You said you wanted to disappear while you're pretty like a flower.

484
00:49:47.390 --> 00:49:48.820
Yes, I did.

485
00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:53.370
I'll be sure to burn you while you're pretty (also means good).

486
00:49:53.370 --> 00:49:54.970
Jin Bu Ja.

487
00:49:58.970 --> 00:50:01.560
You're not Jin Bu Ja now, right?

488
00:50:04.450 --> 00:50:07.930
It's Jeong Se Ra. Jeong Se Ra. Geez.

489
00:50:07.930 --> 00:50:11.060
- Yes.
- I'll burn you next time for sure.

490
00:50:19.010 --> 00:50:22.570
<i>Great Sage, equal to heaven, Son Oh Gong.</i>

491
00:50:22.570 --> 00:50:27.820
<i>If I possess Sam Jang, will he become mine?</i>

492
00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:35.350
Ma Wang! Ma Wang!

493
00:50:35.350 --> 00:50:38.020
Ah, what's with him now?

494
00:50:38.020 --> 00:50:41.340
Did you see it? You did, didn't you! They said you met.

495
00:50:42.110 --> 00:50:45.360
- What?
- You didn't know? That thing just now!

496
00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:46.980
Who?

497
00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:50.720
That shaman hiding behind Bu Ja's face and body!

498
00:50:52.030 --> 00:50:54.460
That wasn't Bu Ja?

499
00:50:54.460 --> 00:50:58.870
Wow, there's really no helping you when you're energy is low, Ma Wang. That wasn't Bu Ja.

500
00:50:58.870 --> 00:51:01.310
Instead of Bu Ja,

501
00:51:01.310 --> 00:51:03.980
- that was a shaman?
- Yes. Ah Sa Nyeo.

502
00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:05.750
Ah Sa Nyeo?

503
00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:09.710
Why did it come here?

504
00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:12.850
What does it want to get by pretending it's Bu Ja?

505
00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:17.410
Ugh, this is...

506
00:51:17.410 --> 00:51:21.670
I must not have realized because I was tired.

507
00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:25.950
And so? What did you do with the Ah Sa Nyeo? Did you take care of her?

508
00:51:25.950 --> 00:51:28.050
- I just let her go of course.
- What?

509
00:51:28.050 --> 00:51:29.930
You already recognized her so what did you let her go for?

510
00:51:29.930 --> 00:51:35.890
Why do I have to do that by myself? A guy with pitch-black eyes doesn't seem ordinarily strong. We should do it together!

511
00:51:35.890 --> 00:51:40.940
Come on now, I don't have any strength right now because I'm low on energy. Take care of it yourself. Geez.

512
00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:44.830
Is this how you're going to be? I'm going to have to grab my heart again. I'm taking out the meds. I'm taking them out.

513
00:51:44.830 --> 00:51:47.850
Okay, okay!

514
00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:53.430
Instead of shirking it off on each other, let's just split the work between us.

515
00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:57.730
I'll capture her so you figure out a way to seal her again.

516
00:51:57.730 --> 00:52:03.030
Since she came out from under the divine tree, checking things out there should be enough.

517
00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:04.660
Okay.

518
00:52:08.690 --> 00:52:11.340
But, Ma Wang

519
00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:14.940
why do you think she looked for you first?

520
00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:22.790
You didn't make some kind of hush-hush deal with her, did you?

521
00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:27.440
She just took the energy beads and left.

522
00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:29.770
Don't stab me in the back. I mean it.

523
00:52:29.770 --> 00:52:34.160
I'm not going to! Do you think I'm some kind of thug like you!

524
00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:37.720
You think everyone's just like you. Sheesh.

525
00:52:48.830 --> 00:52:51.750
Ah Sa Nyeo's proposal

526
00:52:52.810 --> 00:52:55.460
was extremely tempting.

527
00:52:56.590 --> 00:52:59.740
Shall I help her

528
00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:02.770
for you, Ma Wang?

529
00:53:04.580 --> 00:53:08.410
I ignored it when I thought it was just Bu Ja saying that.

530
00:53:08.410 --> 00:53:13.640
But it's a different story if a shaman with immense power is offering to help me.

531
00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:18.770
Then you should ruthlessly backstab Son Oh Gong of course.

532
00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:25.350
Once Son Oh Gong lures her, you should entice her onto your side.

533
00:53:25.350 --> 00:53:31.380
Yeah. We don't know what will happen

534
00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:33.990
so get another contract ready.

535
00:53:39.940 --> 00:53:41.760
You're going back to America?

536
00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:45.340
Yes. I'm going back tomorrow.

537
00:53:45.340 --> 00:53:48.700
When my movie comes out next year I'll invite you to the film festival for it.

538
00:53:48.700 --> 00:53:50.630
Thank you.

539
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:55.810
Ah! Also, thank you for sending the roses.

540
00:53:55.810 --> 00:53:59.060
Even though a rotten fairy took them all away right afterwards.

541
00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:00.700
Roses?

542
00:54:01.610 --> 00:54:06.400
Weren't you the one that sent the roses?

543
00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:09.640
I had prepared a different gift for you.

544
00:54:26.470 --> 00:54:31.270
That necklace's name is "Happy Ending." Just as in my movie's ending,

545
00:54:31.270 --> 00:54:33.970
the brave little girl gets a happy ending

546
00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:39.280
and so I hope for a happy ending for you and your fairy, Seon Mi.

547
00:54:53.930 --> 00:54:58.620
Happy ending? So it's pretty much the same as the match-made in heaven.

548
00:55:03.780 --> 00:55:07.900
Oh? Where did it go?

549
00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:12.790
Did it disappear after ringing once?

550
00:55:14.170 --> 00:55:17.730
I didn't even get to show it to Son Oh Gong.

551
00:55:18.810 --> 00:55:23.500
The bell sound that Sam Jang heard was the sound of the Death Bell.

552
00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:26.660
Although she thinks it was the sound of a Love Bell.

553
00:55:29.370 --> 00:55:32.290
Don't tell her. Just let her think that.

554
00:55:32.290 --> 00:55:36.700
Right. Leaving it be like that will let her be happy.

555
00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:40.950
The matter of death and killing is too sad.

556
00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:46.340
Knowing in advance will just make it sad for longer.

557
00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:51.450
Did Bu Ja come here today?

558
00:55:51.450 --> 00:55:55.570
Yes. Just a bit ago. She took a stick of lipstick.

559
00:55:55.570 --> 00:55:59.850
She like the rose-colored lipstick so I gave it to her.

560
00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.230
Wow, such a sly fox.

561
00:56:03.230 --> 00:56:05.960
Sly fox? Me?

562
00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:09.350
No. Say, Summer Fairy,

563
00:56:09.350 --> 00:56:12.390
do you by chance know anything about shamans?

564
00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:18.770
You're under the impression that I know a lot about shamans because I'm a Taoist fairy, but I don't.

565
00:56:18.770 --> 00:56:20.240
When it comes to shamans,

566
00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:25.350
- isn't there a person that you know well that's similar to one?
- Who?

567
00:56:25.350 --> 00:56:29.720
Sam Jang. Sam Jang is also a kind of shaman.

568
00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:33.800
She's a human but she's able to do things connected to the spiritual world.

569
00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:35.750
You don't say.

570
00:56:38.360 --> 00:56:42.200
So is that why that shaman is hanging around Sam Jang.

571
00:56:44.620 --> 00:56:47.980
Wanting to eat meat wasn't such a big deal for you, I see.

572
00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:52.810
Bu Ja, didn't you not like meat?

573
00:56:53.570 --> 00:56:58.170
After getting severely injured, I wanted to eat meat.

574
00:56:59.340 --> 00:57:04.040
I heard hyungnim took you to Sureumdong and fixed you up?

575
00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:05.720
Yes.

576
00:57:12.230 --> 00:57:17.140
Bu Ja, weren't you originally right-handed?

577
00:57:25.030 --> 00:57:26.700
Sa Oh Jeong,

578
00:57:27.900 --> 00:57:30.770
wasn't I left-handed?

579
00:57:40.940 --> 00:57:46.620
Oh. Yes, that's right. You were left-handed.

580
00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:49.510
Help yourself to lots of meat.

581
00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:51.750
Thank you.

582
00:57:51.750 --> 00:57:55.670
Sa Oh Jeong, could you make some of Unnie's favorite food?

583
00:57:55.670 --> 00:57:58.530
I want to go see her.

584
00:58:04.740 --> 00:58:06.630
What do you want to do about that coffin?

585
00:58:06.630 --> 00:58:12.230
Throw it out. Toss it into the ocean with the trailer as orginally planned.

586
00:58:25.430 --> 00:58:27.320
A rose.

587
00:58:30.540 --> 00:58:32.820
It still has a scent.

588
00:58:36.690 --> 00:58:38.800
Is it not dead?

589
00:58:40.100 --> 00:58:42.490
I was told a stone coffin came out from under the tree.

590
00:58:42.490 --> 00:58:46.960
That's right. The tree's roots were wrapped around the coffin like a cocoon.

591
00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:50.240
Then where is that stone coffin now?

592
00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:54.360
It was moved to a warehouse so it wouldn't be talked about.

593
00:59:01.390 --> 00:59:04.300
There's still a scent of roses.

594
00:59:04.300 --> 00:59:07.400
It must be true that it was moved after being in here.

595
00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:10.150
It looks like they already threw it out.

596
00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:13.630
Or it's possible it was taken somewhere else.

597
00:59:13.630 --> 00:59:17.510
What use would a human have for Ah Sa Nyeo's stone coffin?

598
00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:21.340
You mentioned Korean Foundation's Kang Dae Seong, right?

599
00:59:21.340 --> 00:59:26.600
Did he learn that Ah Sa Nyeo is a shaman that can create a king

600
00:59:27.250 --> 00:59:30.770
and so he took away the stone coffin?

601
00:59:51.860 --> 00:59:58.330
I think that woman will come look for this again.

602
00:59:58.330 --> 01:00:01.120
I came to see you, Unnie.

603
01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:03.280
Bu Ja, you got a lot better.

604
01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:08.210
Yes. I brought food that Sa Oh Jeong made.

605
01:00:08.210 --> 01:00:10.050
Thank you.

606
01:00:10.050 --> 01:00:12.550
These are roses.

607
01:00:12.550 --> 01:00:13.980
They're pretty.

608
01:00:13.980 --> 01:00:15.370
Let's go in and eat together.

609
01:00:15.370 --> 01:00:17.600
Oh, come inside.

610
01:00:38.770 --> 01:00:42.410
You have a lotus flower smell.

611
01:00:42.410 --> 01:00:45.010
Yes, my blood is like that.

612
01:00:45.010 --> 01:00:48.090
You also have my blood in you.

613
01:00:48.090 --> 01:00:53.190
Yes. The one who woke me up was Sam Jang.

614
01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:59.240
Son Oh Gong isn't here?

615
01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:03.980
Yes. These days, we're in an awkward situation.

616
01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:07.070
Honestly, on the day you were hurt, he was hurt a little too.

617
01:01:07.070 --> 01:01:11.110
I know. He was hurt because of you, right?

618
01:01:13.490 --> 01:01:15.830
Because you called for him.

619
01:01:17.930 --> 01:01:20.460
Then you shouldn't keep calling for him.

620
01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:22.910
That would cause him so much harm.

621
01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:25.820
I know.

622
01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:30.000
If you don't call Son Oh Gong,

623
01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:33.020
you won't be able to do anything, right?

624
01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:45.080
To be protected by the Great Sage,

625
01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:48.470
don't you think you should have a special ability?

626
01:01:48.470 --> 01:01:50.500
What ability?

627
01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:03.400
- Son Oh Gong.
- Are you two coming together secretly to eat good food?

628
01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:08.250
How much luxury have I provided to you all of this time? All the food you are eating here was brought by Oh Jeong.

629
01:02:08.250 --> 01:02:10.540
You should have called me first.

630
01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:14.990
Then, you two go ahead and eat.

631
01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:19.600
Where are you going? Come over here.

632
01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:21.370
Come over here.

633
01:02:22.270 --> 01:02:24.170
Sit over here.

634
01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:39.620
Why are you throwing away perfectly fine flowers?

635
01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:41.740
You threw away all the flowers too which came to my real estate office as gifts, didn't you?

636
01:02:41.740 --> 01:02:43.760
- Yes.
- Why?

637
01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:46.210
You're already so pretty like this. Why would I need to look at flowers?

638
01:02:46.210 --> 01:02:49.200
I don't need flowers.

639
01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:51.150
And those flowers are dangerous.

640
01:02:51.150 --> 01:02:52.590
What?

641
01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:01.840
I told you not to get hurt, didn't I?

642
01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:06.920
I got a scratch without realizing it.

643
01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:08.790
Don't get hurt.

644
01:03:08.790 --> 01:03:12.350
Even though I'll still think you're pretty with the scar, it upsets me.

645
01:03:37.050 --> 01:03:40.030
Looks like I don't have to wait anymore.

646
01:03:40.030 --> 01:03:41.760
What?

647
01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:45.640
There's something. A bad bull bastard.

648
01:03:46.930 --> 01:03:49.470
If we want to find the sarcophagus that Kang Dae Seong has,

649
01:03:49.470 --> 01:03:53.380
I think you are going to have to the risk of exposing your existence.

650
01:03:53.380 --> 01:03:55.980
Why go through that risk?

651
01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:59.560
I plan to find the stone coffin later.

652
01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:01.530
Son Oh Gong is probably waiting for you.

653
01:04:01.530 --> 01:04:06.120
After holding onto Ah Sa Nyeo, knowing his personality, he'll probably get into a fight with her.

654
01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:08.660
It'll be dangerous to fight it out in Sam Jang's house,

655
01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:10.810
so he'll drag her to Sureumdong.

656
01:04:10.810 --> 01:04:13.500
When the two of them are done fighting it out,

657
01:04:14.250 --> 01:04:19.240
we'll know what it is that Ah Sa Nyeo wants.

658
01:04:20.350 --> 01:04:22.820
As expected, Ma Wang, you're great.

659
01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:31.320
But... what exactly does the Priestess want?

660
01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:46.540
- Come with me.
- To where?

661
01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:48.510
- Sureumdong.
- Your house?

662
01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:50.010
Yes.

663
01:04:51.010 --> 01:04:53.070
I told you I would burn you.

664
01:04:53.070 --> 01:04:55.840
Ah, that's not necessary anymore.

665
01:04:55.840 --> 01:05:01.090
No. I think I must burn you.

666
01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:06.700
Let's go quietly.

667
01:05:10.180 --> 01:05:13.640
Go ahead and eat. I'll go to Sureumdong to get a nice bottle of alcohol.

668
01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:16.170
Alcohol? I have alcohol at home.

669
01:05:16.170 --> 01:05:21.900
No, I'll get you a really priceless bottle that you'll like.

670
01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:23.210
You have to take Bu Ja with you?

671
01:05:23.210 --> 01:05:28.390
Yes. Bu Ja came with me to Sureumdong last time too.

672
01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:29.930
Right?

673
01:05:29.930 --> 01:05:31.370
Yes.

674
01:05:32.010 --> 01:05:34.680
- We'll be back.
- Okay.

675
01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:45.850
<i>[Difficult college entrance exams.
"We will be your guide."]</i>

676
01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:53.730
The food is cold now. Why aren't they back?

677
01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:57.320
Should I call him?

678
01:06:05.780 --> 01:06:09.740
Oh, why are you here, Ma Wang?

679
01:06:14.550 --> 01:06:18.020
- I came to stop you from doing it.
- What?

680
01:06:18.020 --> 01:06:21.820
Sam Jang, don't call Son Oh Gong tonight.

681
01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:28.500
Son Oh Gong has to take care of something important there.

682
01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:42.370
Did we come here to fight?

683
01:06:42.370 --> 01:06:43.860
Are you crazy?

684
01:06:43.860 --> 01:06:47.130
There are so many expensive bottles of alcohol here. Why would we fight here?

685
01:06:56.030 --> 01:07:00.230
- You're Ah Sa Nyeo?
- Yes, Great Sage Son Oh Gong.

686
01:07:00.230 --> 01:07:03.970
You've been asleep for 1,000 years so there must be many things you want to do now that you're awake.

687
01:07:03.970 --> 01:07:06.120
I don't want to stop you.

688
01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:10.660
Ma Wang is going to interrupt you while you do what you want.

689
01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:13.330
He also went to find your stone coffin.

690
01:07:13.330 --> 01:07:17.130
Don't tell him that I told you and go to Ma Wang.

691
01:07:17.130 --> 01:07:23.500
You really won't stop me from what I want to do?

692
01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:26.170
What do you want to do?

693
01:07:26.170 --> 01:07:27.700
I have to do what I can do.

694
01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:29.880
What can you do?

695
01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:39.720
I want to become Sam Jang.

696
01:07:41.620 --> 01:07:45.030
I want to have you.

697
01:07:58.390 --> 01:08:03.270
Son Oh Gong, you will protect me from now on.

698
01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:10.900
Why am I so popular these days?

699
01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:19.780
That sounds like something I can't do.

700
01:08:54.740 --> 01:09:00.480
I can manipulate souls.

701
01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:08.040
What I want is you.

702
01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:16.720
From now on, you'll stay by my side forever, unchanged.

703
01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:20.020
You will protect me.
