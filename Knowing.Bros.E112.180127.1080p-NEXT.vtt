00:00:10.983 --> 00:00:12.953
(January 18, 2018/Bros School)

3
00:00:12.978 --> 00:00:14.671
Clap! Clap! Clap!

4
00:00:16.125 --> 00:00:17.250
Let's go!

5
00:00:17.275 --> 00:00:20.554
- All right. - Oh, Class President Seo.

6
00:00:21.117 --> 00:00:23.570
- You guys did your homework, right? - Yes.

7
00:00:23.694 --> 00:00:25.132
Yesterday, our teacher-

8
00:00:25.615 --> 00:00:27.109
Wait, we have a teacher?

9
00:00:27.134 --> 00:00:28.593
There's Mr. Jang Sung-kyu.

10
00:00:28.618 --> 00:00:34.601
He gave us homework to write down our wish list for the year 2018.

11
00:00:34.703 --> 00:00:36.015
- Yes. - You guys did it, right?

12
00:00:36.328 --> 00:00:39.976
Then let's present it one by one. Starting with Sang-min.

13
00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:42.115
My wish list for 2018.

14
00:00:42.388 --> 00:00:44.911
One, to repay all my debts.

15
00:00:47.185 --> 00:00:50.700
- That means he'll be able to repay all of them back this year. - Two, to donate.

16
00:00:52.693 --> 00:00:55.107
You're not going to go back into debt after donating, right?

17
00:00:56.537 --> 00:00:59.693
- After you donate two million dollars. - Then you're the angel of debt.

18
00:00:59.982 --> 00:01:02.708
Three, to go on vacation for a month.

19
00:01:04.443 --> 00:01:08.380
- What about "Ask Us Anything?" - Are you leaving after departing from all shows?

20
00:01:08.405 --> 00:01:09.505
Including this one?

21
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.115
- So you're rich now? - No!

22
00:01:12.013 --> 00:01:16.200
- Then why'd you come up with that? - It's impossible to do.

23
00:01:16.568 --> 00:01:21.466
- It can happen one day. - When you're cut from all programs.

24
00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:24.435
Words are frightening things.

25
00:01:25.513 --> 00:01:28.286
- Knock on wood. - Knock, knock, knock.

26
00:01:28.311 --> 00:01:31.575
Long time ago, I said I wanted a break for a week, and look what happened.

27
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.099
Be careful of what you say.

28
00:01:33.124 --> 00:01:35.669
When I say I'm going on a month-long vacation, it doesn't mean-

29
00:01:35.694 --> 00:01:38.029
- Knock on wood. - I did. Knock, knock, knock.

30
00:01:38.054 --> 00:01:39.380
On Ho-dong's face.

31
00:01:42.857 --> 00:01:45.716
He can go on a month-long vacation. Just come back for recording.

32
00:01:45.857 --> 00:01:49.747
How could he when he doesn't even have a private plane like you do?

33
00:01:50.146 --> 00:01:51.146
Nice one.

34
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.488
- Next. - He's enjoying it now.

35
00:01:54.513 --> 00:01:56.104
- Young-chul. - It's my turn next?

36
00:01:56.464 --> 00:01:57.721
I put my sincerity in it.

37
00:01:58.214 --> 00:02:02.487
It's my wish to become the ace of this show.

38
00:02:02.512 --> 00:02:04.635
"Ask Us Anything" is finally losing its touch.

39
00:02:04.956 --> 00:02:06.089
What do you mean?

40
00:02:06.472 --> 00:02:09.391
If you want to become the ace, Ho-dong, Soo-geun,

41
00:02:09.416 --> 00:02:11.808
Sang-min, and Kyung-hoon have to go down.

42
00:02:11.833 --> 00:02:14.776
- Hurry up and knock on wood. - Knock, knock, knock.

43
00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:17.278
- On your own face. - Knock, knock, knock.

44
00:02:17.521 --> 00:02:20.121
Whenever I bother Hee-chul, the writers go, "Why

45
00:02:20.146 --> 00:02:22.427
do you keep bothering the ace of the show?"

46
00:02:22.825 --> 00:02:26.184
I envied that, so I wanted to be the ace.

47
00:02:26.404 --> 00:02:29.692
- If you get married and have kids, you'll become the ace. - Really?

48
00:02:31.333 --> 00:02:32.973
Ho-dong, what was that?

49
00:02:33.403 --> 00:02:36.247
Second on my list is to meet a Korean woman.

50
00:02:37.786 --> 00:02:40.380
That's cool! You met a woman from New York, too.

51
00:02:40.864 --> 00:02:43.903
- I had a fling with a foreign woman. - Amazing.

52
00:02:43.928 --> 00:02:46.669
Third on my list is that I hope one of my two wishes come true.

53
00:02:46.694 --> 00:02:48.794
Which one is more difficult to achieve?

54
00:02:50.318 --> 00:02:54.012
I wrote something realistic because there are many people I'm grateful to around me.

55
00:02:54.622 --> 00:02:58.786
I want the health of my personal staff who have worked with me for 14 years.

56
00:02:59.505 --> 00:03:04.606
I want you to not be sick and work with me for a long time. Scream loudly, Kims!

57
00:03:05.747 --> 00:03:06.747
Good girls.

58
00:03:08.512 --> 00:03:10.755
You guys have extreme jobs.

59
00:03:10.997 --> 00:03:14.731
Submit a complaint to the human rights bureau.

60
00:03:15.075 --> 00:03:17.778
Next up, I'm very grateful for these people.

61
00:03:17.803 --> 00:03:20.333
I wish for the happiness of the staff of "Ask Us Anything."

62
00:03:21.685 --> 00:03:23.830
Scream for the ace!

63
00:03:24.838 --> 00:03:25.838
That's right!

64
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.674
Last of all, I wish this will come true.

65
00:03:29.892 --> 00:03:35.291
I hope Ho-dong can live for a long, long time and take care of his health.

66
00:03:35.401 --> 00:03:37.299
That's your 2018 wish list?

67
00:03:38.111 --> 00:03:41.556
I want Ho-dong to live for a long time and-

68
00:03:43.064 --> 00:03:45.447
(Worry about the real things.)

69
00:03:45.712 --> 00:03:47.447
(Cheering on his long life)

70
00:03:47.612 --> 00:03:49.682
I don't even want to waste my words on him.

71
00:03:50.895 --> 00:03:53.830
(The champion still has enough energy to throw water.)

72
00:03:53.855 --> 00:03:56.447
My first wish is for Buzz to become global.

73
00:03:58.744 --> 00:04:01.658
But there's a condition. I'm not going to go abroad.

74
00:04:02.721 --> 00:04:06.456
- What do you mean? - Only my music will.

75
00:04:06.481 --> 00:04:09.525
- Second one? - For Buzz albums to be popular.

76
00:04:09.752 --> 00:04:14.521
My third wish is to receive at least three confessions from women.

77
00:04:15.841 --> 00:04:18.154
Wait a minute. You're going to date this year?

78
00:04:18.403 --> 00:04:22.388
Rather than dating, I think it'd be nice to receive such confessions.

79
00:04:22.413 --> 00:04:25.747
If you like someone, you can confess to her. How can you receive confessions?

80
00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.357
My wish list for 2018.

81
00:04:28.654 --> 00:04:30.833
First, to not mature this year.

82
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.536
That's great. I sincerely praise you.

83
00:04:35.709 --> 00:04:38.786
Right, especially for people whose job is to make others laugh.

84
00:04:38.811 --> 00:04:42.552
That means your innocence would be destroyed. You have to preserve it.

85
00:04:42.935 --> 00:04:44.732
Second, for my two sons to grow.

86
00:04:46.232 --> 00:04:48.271
I hope they can grow taller in 2018.

87
00:04:48.304 --> 00:04:52.357
Tae-joon is going onto 4th grade, but his height is remaining in the previous grade.

88
00:04:52.537 --> 00:04:54.935
- It's very dangerous. - "I wish I was taller."

89
00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.857
And I want our "Ask Us Anything" members and writers to date.

90
00:05:01.568 --> 00:05:05.927
That's why I'm preparing a 6:6 blind date with the writers.

91
00:05:06.083 --> 00:05:08.150
- With who? - My older brother will be there, too.

92
00:05:10.209 --> 00:05:12.490
He was born in 1971, but he doesn't have a girlfriend.

93
00:05:13.756 --> 00:05:15.755
So that's why I'm going to hook them up.

94
00:05:17.045 --> 00:05:18.427
I'm the real deal though.

95
00:05:18.575 --> 00:05:23.615
Something for me is a small victory. Something for others is a great victory.

96
00:05:24.435 --> 00:05:25.871
I'm looking forward to this.

97
00:05:25.896 --> 00:05:30.091
I want Jang-hoon to become more handsome.

98
00:05:32.122 --> 00:05:35.247
Therefore, I want him to get a girlfriend.

99
00:05:35.951 --> 00:05:38.107
So he's single because he's ugly.

100
00:05:41.185 --> 00:05:44.822
Finally, I want them to date for a long time.

101
00:05:46.401 --> 00:05:50.955
- So it's a wish list for Jang-hoon. - By that, you mean for the year 2018? (Pun)

102
00:05:53.354 --> 00:05:55.119
I want him to surpass the year...

103
00:05:55.901 --> 00:05:57.447
I want them to last forever.

104
00:05:59.323 --> 00:06:01.596
- You go, too, class president. - Okay, for me...

105
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.596
- First off, let's be happy! - Good one.

106
00:06:05.862 --> 00:06:08.025
Second, my parents' health.

107
00:06:08.807 --> 00:06:10.650
- That's nice. - Third...

108
00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:14.549
"Ask Us Anything" is doing well now,

109
00:06:15.292 --> 00:06:19.815
but I hope it will continue to do well.

110
00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.908
Then don't whine during filming.

111
00:06:24.134 --> 00:06:27.643
- Freedom of speech. - "Freedom of speech."

112
00:06:28.135 --> 00:06:34.854
Anyways, let's all make an effort to fulfill our wishes for 2018.

113
00:06:35.135 --> 00:06:36.932
Let's do our best!

114
00:06:44.046 --> 00:06:49.971
(Lee Da-hee & Han Hyun-min are here!)

115
00:06:49.996 --> 00:06:52.994
(Brothers are buzzing with excitement.)

116
00:06:53.221 --> 00:06:56.084
Hello. I'm model Han Hyun-min who came from a

117
00:06:56.109 --> 00:06:59.034
school where the whole world was focused on me.

118
00:06:59.533 --> 00:07:03.150
- It's nice to meet you. - It's like seeing a celebrity.

119
00:07:03.175 --> 00:07:05.799
- You're super tall. - He's currently a real high school student.

120
00:07:05.824 --> 00:07:07.315
I'm a real high schooler.

121
00:07:09.573 --> 00:07:12.557
Actually, you don't call us high schoolers now. You call us meal service.

122
00:07:12.838 --> 00:07:14.815
- "Meal service."  - Why?

123
00:07:15.494 --> 00:07:17.702
There are students who go to school to study,

124
00:07:17.727 --> 00:07:19.790
but there are students who go to eat meals.

125
00:07:19.815 --> 00:07:21.861
Do you give water to your hair and grow it out?

126
00:07:22.479 --> 00:07:23.479
My hair...

127
00:07:25.198 --> 00:07:27.994
It was popular to water plants and make them grow back in the days.

128
00:07:28.019 --> 00:07:30.424
If you count his hair, he'll be 2 meters high.

129
00:07:30.449 --> 00:07:35.455
- I think so. - If you came out next month, you'd be the same height as Jang-hoon.

130
00:07:35.768 --> 00:07:38.416
I feel like Hyun-min was the torch for the Pyeongchang Olympics.

131
00:07:42.503 --> 00:07:43.503
That's true!

132
00:07:44.503 --> 00:07:47.908
I met Da-hee on "X-Men..."

133
00:07:48.346 --> 00:07:50.854
"Beautiful Sunday."

134
00:07:51.189 --> 00:07:54.947
We met on "Beautiful Sunday!"

135
00:07:55.346 --> 00:07:57.674
- You remember that? - Of course!

136
00:07:58.182 --> 00:08:00.135
- Hi. - Hi.

137
00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.160
You're bright.

138
00:08:01.838 --> 00:08:07.291
I'm Lee Da-hee from a school where people fell for my charms after just ten minutes.

139
00:08:07.316 --> 00:08:09.299
- It's nice to meet you. - It's nice to meet you.

140
00:08:09.324 --> 00:08:12.596
Liar. It's only been a minute, and I fell for you already.

141
00:08:14.462 --> 00:08:16.479
It's been a while since I threw an amorous look.

142
00:08:16.769 --> 00:08:18.221
Are you guys good at swimming?

143
00:08:18.557 --> 00:08:19.963
- Swimming? - Are you swimming?

144
00:08:19.988 --> 00:08:21.947
- Are you good at swimming? - I swim in the sea.

145
00:08:21.972 --> 00:08:27.408
You're good at swimming? Fine, then. Dive into my charms and...

146
00:08:28.862 --> 00:08:33.166
- Can't you say it with confidence? - Let me do it one more time.

147
00:08:33.643 --> 00:08:37.565
- What do you mean? - This isn't a drama. It's a variety show. You're done.

148
00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:40.486
Dive into my charms and let's have a good time.

149
00:08:40.737 --> 00:08:43.986
- All right. - What charms do you have?

150
00:08:44.659 --> 00:08:47.533
- Do you really not know? - We wouldn't know.

151
00:08:48.151 --> 00:08:51.182
My face is fine. My height is fine. My body is fine.

152
00:08:51.207 --> 00:08:55.575
- Hey, we have a pig here, too. (Pun) - I was born a pig.

153
00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:59.088
I can dance and sing. There's nothing I can't do.

154
00:08:59.113 --> 00:09:02.041
- You're good at dancing? - I think she wants us to make her dance.

155
00:09:02.066 --> 00:09:05.275
- No, that's no what I meant! - Music cue!

156
00:09:07.432 --> 00:09:11.635
Not yet! I have to start from the beginning! No!

157
00:09:17.138 --> 00:09:20.424
("Likey" - TWICE)

158
00:09:29.588 --> 00:09:30.760
Awesome!

159
00:09:37.509 --> 00:09:38.854
She didn't change at all.

160
00:09:54.674 --> 00:09:56.010
Did you learn it from the video?

161
00:09:56.035 --> 00:09:59.711
There was the dance in the intro, but the music turned on too quickly.

162
00:10:00.813 --> 00:10:01.813
Good job.

163
00:10:04.027 --> 00:10:06.531
(Good job. Take a breath)

164
00:10:06.645 --> 00:10:09.779
When the music turns on, we can tell if you have a sense of rhythm or not.

165
00:10:09.804 --> 00:10:10.804
Are you good at singing?

166
00:10:12.094 --> 00:10:14.945
- Can you sing an OST? - Did you see her expression just now?

167
00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:17.719
You sang an OST? Did you bring the accompaniment?

168
00:10:18.243 --> 00:10:19.453
No, why do I need one?

169
00:10:19.774 --> 00:10:21.953
- Really? - Amazing.

170
00:10:21.978 --> 00:10:24.476
- So acoustic on the spot? - Hold on.

171
00:10:24.578 --> 00:10:29.039
Da-hee wasn't like that. She used to be shy and turn red whenever you talked to her.

172
00:10:29.064 --> 00:10:32.336
Back then, I was like that because I was scared of you.

173
00:10:32.361 --> 00:10:33.687
Many people say that.

174
00:10:33.712 --> 00:10:35.875
What on earth have you done?

175
00:10:37.219 --> 00:10:38.578
Seriously!

176
00:10:39.188 --> 00:10:42.980
Did I bite people? Why would you be so scared of me?

177
00:10:43.005 --> 00:10:46.594
Your first impression was just frightening.

178
00:10:47.618 --> 00:10:48.618
What can I do?

179
00:10:50.922 --> 00:10:53.070
(Anticipating)

180
00:11:00.101 --> 00:11:01.101
Don't laugh!

181
00:11:01.126 --> 00:11:04.430
- No one laughed! - You were just wrong!

182
00:11:05.391 --> 00:11:07.062
(Embarrassed...)

183
00:11:07.087 --> 00:11:09.687
Your voice cracked.

184
00:11:09.712 --> 00:11:12.101
You're really good at blaming people!

185
00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:17.406
- Can't you sincerely listen to me? - Try sincerely singing it.

186
00:11:26.297 --> 00:11:27.497
It's a nice voice.

187
00:11:29.383 --> 00:11:31.015
She's preparing to blame someone else!

188
00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:34.648
- No. I'm good as long as I heard those words. Thank you. - Good job!

189
00:11:37.453 --> 00:11:40.680
- Hyun-min, don't you have anything to do? - Drop the beat.

190
00:11:40.907 --> 00:11:43.226
- Drop the beat? - You have music, too?

191
00:11:43.868 --> 00:11:46.375
- Out of the blue? - I bet it's an amazing dance!

192
00:11:49.106 --> 00:11:53.573
(What is the glamorous groove that will come out from Hyun-min...?)

193
00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:56.773
- What? - What's that?

194
00:12:00.875 --> 00:12:02.586
He's Ssamja!

195
00:12:04.571 --> 00:12:05.750
Do the wave!

196
00:12:16.609 --> 00:12:18.812
You have groove. The Ssamja groove.

197
00:12:18.984 --> 00:12:20.039
This is troublesome.

198
00:12:20.064 --> 00:12:23.305
You guys don't know,

199
00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:26.004
but Hyun-min was chosen as one of "The 30 Most

200
00:12:26.029 --> 00:12:28.532
Influential Teens of 2017" by TIME Magazine.

201
00:12:28.557 --> 00:12:30.226
Why do they keep picking people?

202
00:12:30.251 --> 00:12:31.390
How'd you get chosen?

203
00:12:31.867 --> 00:12:36.586
It's not easy to be a model in Korea with these kind of looks.

204
00:12:37.117 --> 00:12:42.320
Despite that fact, I did about 50 fashion shows last year.

205
00:12:43.922 --> 00:12:46.792
I also went abroad, so I think TIME Magazine presented

206
00:12:47.039 --> 00:12:49.633
me with this award as an encouragement to work harder.

207
00:12:49.658 --> 00:12:51.476
At what age did you start modeling?

208
00:12:51.696 --> 00:12:54.281
I started when I was in eighth grade.

209
00:12:54.586 --> 00:12:57.195
- I uploaded a photo on social media. - It's that photo.

210
00:12:59.321 --> 00:13:03.180
- Your hair is shaved. - The agency saw this photo and discovered me.

211
00:13:03.735 --> 00:13:08.250
We met in Itaewon, and they told me to walk on the streets.

212
00:13:09.039 --> 00:13:13.672
I did, and they offered a contract right away, so that's when I started modeling.

213
00:13:14.024 --> 00:13:15.633
He looks like a model in that photo.

214
00:13:15.658 --> 00:13:21.062
That photo went out on Britain's BBC.

215
00:13:21.493 --> 00:13:23.656
It became a hot issue.

216
00:13:23.828 --> 00:13:26.117
- At 16? - You were 16? You look very young.

217
00:13:26.789 --> 00:13:29.015
- That's cool. - That was in middle school?

218
00:13:31.155 --> 00:13:34.328
That photo was in TIME Magazine.

219
00:13:35.071 --> 00:13:39.289
- He gives off the vibe of SHINee's Minho. - Yeah, he does.

220
00:13:39.314 --> 00:13:42.578
- Your mom is Korean and your dad is Nigerian. - Right.

221
00:13:42.657 --> 00:13:44.844
Is your father good at Korean?

222
00:13:45.038 --> 00:13:47.765
- My mom translates between us. - Goodness!

223
00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:50.063
That's hilarious!

224
00:13:51.235 --> 00:13:53.367
- Look at Da-hee. - Why?

225
00:13:53.797 --> 00:13:59.633
We need to find out why Da-hee danced and sang as soon as she came here.

226
00:14:00.446 --> 00:14:03.804
That's because she wants to look good to someone!

227
00:14:04.413 --> 00:14:07.000
(Out of the bros?)

228
00:14:07.399 --> 00:14:09.836
- Seo Jang-hoon! - Me?

229
00:14:11.548 --> 00:14:14.180
Hold on. My wish list is being fulfilled.

230
00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:18.157
Jang-hoon is very tall, you know?

231
00:14:18.182 --> 00:14:25.868
So I wanted to see him in real person and stand next to him in order to feel petite.

232
00:14:25.893 --> 00:14:30.008
- So let's stand together. - Stay there.

233
00:14:31.399 --> 00:14:33.641
He must have brought his cartilage today.

234
00:14:33.666 --> 00:14:39.339
How about being this petite?

235
00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:41.125
Why are you laughing at me?

236
00:14:42.572 --> 00:14:45.016
(Let's see.)

237
00:14:46.149 --> 00:14:47.216
Do I look small?

238
00:14:48.813 --> 00:14:50.703
Da-hee is really tall though.

239
00:14:50.728 --> 00:14:53.524
- How tall are you? - 176 centimeters.

240
00:14:57.938 --> 00:15:01.789
- Come up, Hyun-min. - It's the first time I feel so small.

241
00:15:02.774 --> 00:15:06.000
Hold on. If you count the end of his hair, he could be two meters tall.

242
00:15:07.102 --> 00:15:09.196
He's nearly two meters tall right now.

243
00:15:10.446 --> 00:15:15.586
- Da-hee is super tall. - She is, and she told our writers...

244
00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:19.243
- That she wants to see Jang-hoon. - I really wanted to see you.

245
00:15:19.268 --> 00:15:21.086
- Thank you. - She really wanted to see you.

246
00:15:21.188 --> 00:15:24.586
- Their age gap isn't so big either. - Of course not.

247
00:15:24.953 --> 00:15:26.891
- Are you 34? - I was born in 1985.

248
00:15:26.916 --> 00:15:29.086
- 11 years apart. - They're nearly 12 years apart.

249
00:15:29.891 --> 00:15:31.125
You guys are 11 years apart.

250
00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:35.899
When Jang-hoon used to play basketball, his number was 11!

251
00:15:40.087 --> 00:15:44.102
You put those two together?

252
00:15:44.127 --> 00:15:46.032
You live on the 11th floor, too!

253
00:15:46.571 --> 00:15:48.743
Just say yes!

254
00:15:51.563 --> 00:15:57.953
- But all women who come out are connected to Jang-hoon. - Right.

255
00:15:59.415 --> 00:16:03.516
- We put them together until he finally catches a woman. - He's so popular.

256
00:16:03.673 --> 00:16:07.110
Hyun-min, you're a high school student right now.

257
00:16:07.135 --> 00:16:09.016
- He has a girlfriend, too. - No, I don't.

258
00:16:09.041 --> 00:16:12.414
Does your school know a lot about "Ask Us Anything?"

259
00:16:12.439 --> 00:16:15.469
Yes, many of my friends watch it, and I do, too.

260
00:16:15.494 --> 00:16:17.813
Then who is the most popular...?

261
00:16:19.133 --> 00:16:20.727
What do they think of me?

262
00:16:21.493 --> 00:16:23.282
What on earth is going on?

263
00:16:23.307 --> 00:16:25.836
(He asked a personal question out of the blue!)

264
00:16:26.721 --> 00:16:29.360
(He got the chance of asking a rare genuine high school student.)

265
00:16:29.385 --> 00:16:31.602
(Very curious!)

266
00:16:31.627 --> 00:16:35.125
- I think you have to make yourself known more? - Me?

267
00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:36.922
Do high school students not know me?

268
00:16:37.938 --> 00:16:40.969
First off, Hee-chul is the most popular one.

269
00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:45.914
So they don't have a lot of interest in the rest of us.

270
00:16:45.939 --> 00:16:50.641
- Ho-dong! He looks like someone. - Who?

271
00:16:51.118 --> 00:16:53.907
He looks like the crock pots at my grandmother's house.

272
00:16:58.209 --> 00:17:00.828
(D-line face that looks just like a crock pot)

273
00:17:01.764 --> 00:17:05.000
(Zero incompatibility!)

274
00:17:06.321 --> 00:17:09.680
This is the lid.

275
00:17:10.923 --> 00:17:13.563
The kimchi has ripened well! Close the lid!

276
00:17:17.501 --> 00:17:20.344
- That's the first time you heard of that, right? - It is.

277
00:17:20.369 --> 00:17:21.446
He's that pure.

278
00:17:21.742 --> 00:17:25.907
We're talking way too long about this. Bring me your enrollment forms.

279
00:17:30.485 --> 00:17:33.883
- You're so handsome. - No, I'm ugly.

280
00:17:34.632 --> 00:17:36.352
You know you're handsome.

281
00:17:36.657 --> 00:17:39.852
How could you dare say I look handsome when Hee-chul is right there?

282
00:17:39.877 --> 00:17:42.805
Oh, wow. Rather, I thought...

283
00:17:44.602 --> 00:17:46.539
Hyun-min really liked Hee-chul.

284
00:17:47.087 --> 00:17:51.313
He loves Hee-chul.

285
00:17:52.048 --> 00:17:54.328
It's not that much, but I highly respect him.

286
00:17:55.524 --> 00:17:59.446
- Hug him. - I wonder, how could those kinds of words come from his head?

287
00:17:59.471 --> 00:18:02.430
- Come here. I'll give you a hug. Whoa, you're tall. - Yeah, hug him.

288
00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:07.203
Don't I seem like an aunt he met after a long time?

289
00:18:07.462 --> 00:18:13.602
"Continue to do best in your modeling career, and tell your mom I said hi."

290
00:18:14.423 --> 00:18:16.689
First off, her name is Lee Da-hee.

291
00:18:16.837 --> 00:18:19.797
- Hyun-min, you're just... - I'm a Hyun from Cheongju.

292
00:18:20.563 --> 00:18:23.594
Didn't your dad give you a Nigerian name?

293
00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:26.180
My ID will come out in five months.

294
00:18:26.899 --> 00:18:29.555
- Oh, right, you don't have your ID yet. - That's right!

295
00:18:30.829 --> 00:18:35.149
- When my mom applied for it, she did it with my Korean name. - Of course.

296
00:18:35.462 --> 00:18:37.655
I never went to Nigeria before.

297
00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:40.063
What does your dad call you? Just Hyun-min?

298
00:18:40.266 --> 00:18:42.066
- Han Hyun-min. - Hyun-min.

299
00:18:42.649 --> 00:18:44.055
What's your father's name?

300
00:18:45.204 --> 00:18:46.204
It's Titus.

301
00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:50.375
You can't say it like that. You have to respectfully say his name.

302
00:18:50.541 --> 00:18:53.102
My father's name is Titus, sir.

303
00:18:59.032 --> 00:19:02.860
When adults ask you, you must reply like that from now on.

304
00:19:03.515 --> 00:19:04.715
I was thoughtless.

305
00:19:06.649 --> 00:19:08.243
We'll reveal the nicknames now.

306
00:19:08.268 --> 00:19:09.935
First off, Da-hee's is...

307
00:19:10.688 --> 00:19:14.172
- I think you guys can get it. It's kind of silly. - Guess it.

308
00:19:15.009 --> 00:19:16.696
Isn't there something that comes to mind?

309
00:19:17.048 --> 00:19:21.321
- "Let's fight." (Pun) - It's nothing like that or die die either.

310
00:19:21.774 --> 00:19:24.664
This is a bit... I think you guys will get it.

311
00:19:24.689 --> 00:19:28.305
- "And I..." (Pun) - Right. Please express it exactly.

312
00:19:33.391 --> 00:19:34.727
It's not that long.

313
00:19:35.188 --> 00:19:36.500
It's up to "And I..."

314
00:19:38.743 --> 00:19:40.797
What do your friends call you then?

315
00:19:40.822 --> 00:19:44.313
Just as if you're singing.

316
00:19:44.338 --> 00:19:47.657
Your bodyguard isn't far away.

317
00:19:49.048 --> 00:19:53.227
(207 cm bodyguard is on wait!/Shy.)

318
00:19:53.252 --> 00:19:56.469
So he's changing from the center to Da-hee's bodyguard?

319
00:20:01.305 --> 00:20:05.618
Hyun-min's weakness is that he has a keen nose? What's that?

320
00:20:05.643 --> 00:20:08.602
It's a problem because I can smell things too well.

321
00:20:09.571 --> 00:20:14.110
I went to New York for a photo shoot, and I smelled Korean sausage soup.

322
00:20:14.135 --> 00:20:16.164
- In New York? - On the streets of Manhattan.

323
00:20:16.501 --> 00:20:19.594
I said I smell Korean sausage soup, and the person with me said, "Don't lie."

324
00:20:21.196 --> 00:20:23.092
After going straight and taking a right, there

325
00:20:23.118 --> 00:20:24.892
really was a Korean sausage soup restaurant.

326
00:20:25.071 --> 00:20:28.813
- In Korean town? - It is there.

327
00:20:29.423 --> 00:20:30.618
So I ate it right away.

328
00:20:31.212 --> 00:20:34.016
I can guess most Korean foods with just my sense of smell.

329
00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:39.110
We have a Korean food expert here.

330
00:20:39.135 --> 00:20:40.618
I want to compete against him.

331
00:20:42.438 --> 00:20:46.352
- It's not easy to win against him. - He guesses it right with just a whiff.

332
00:20:46.596 --> 00:20:50.633
Ho-dong might not be good at this because he eats the food before he can smell it.

333
00:20:51.181 --> 00:20:53.782
(The tongue is faster than the nose! - Eating Expert Dr. Kang)

334
00:20:53.807 --> 00:20:56.261
- Hyun-min, come out. - He's going to compete against me?

335
00:20:56.286 --> 00:21:00.745
I'll put the food to your nose, and on three, you will name it.

336
00:21:01.222 --> 00:21:03.339
Da-hee will participate, too.

337
00:21:05.152 --> 00:21:07.808
One of us should try it, too.

338
00:21:08.042 --> 00:21:10.659
- I like eating, but the smell... - I'm good with the smell.

339
00:21:11.121 --> 00:21:14.464
I have bad vision, but I have a keen sense of smell.

340
00:21:14.574 --> 00:21:15.808
Please take a step back.

341
00:21:18.824 --> 00:21:21.339
Give me a bigger blind. My blood won't flow.

342
00:21:28.042 --> 00:21:30.941
This is stuffy! My eyes are being pressed inside right now.

343
00:21:31.152 --> 00:21:33.542
We prepared five different kinds of Korean foods.

344
00:21:33.793 --> 00:21:36.230
The one who guesses the most is the winner.

345
00:21:36.511 --> 00:21:37.909
We'll start from the first one.

346
00:21:39.004 --> 00:21:40.004
Oh, this is...

347
00:21:41.026 --> 00:21:42.691
(1. Soft Tofu Stew)

348
00:21:42.716 --> 00:21:44.277
It might be easy.

349
00:21:44.574 --> 00:21:47.831
- I can't smell anything. - You must get this one right!

350
00:21:47.856 --> 00:21:49.987
- Here we go. - You went too close!

351
00:21:50.012 --> 00:21:51.012
Keep going.

352
00:21:52.612 --> 00:21:54.683
- Got it? - It's too close.

353
00:21:55.034 --> 00:21:56.769
- Got it? - I got it.

354
00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:58.636
Got it? Get ready.

355
00:21:58.879 --> 00:22:00.550
- Say it at the same time? - Yes.

356
00:22:00.575 --> 00:22:01.862
One, two, three.

357
00:22:01.887 --> 00:22:03.792
- Soft tofu stew. - Soft tofu stew.

358
00:22:04.863 --> 00:22:08.253
- Soft tofu, soft tofu, soft tofu. You, Hee-chul? You said something else. - Stew...

359
00:22:08.278 --> 00:22:12.081
You said stew. To be exact, it's soft tofu stew.

360
00:22:15.035 --> 00:22:17.105
Soft tofu stew have their own special smell.

361
00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:19.808
- I thought it was ramen. - I thought it was bean paste stew.

362
00:22:20.597 --> 00:22:22.902
- There's a savory smell. - That's unique.

363
00:22:23.113 --> 00:22:25.011
Hyun-min is good. We'll go with number two.

364
00:22:27.073 --> 00:22:29.737
(2. Sausage Stew)

365
00:22:29.972 --> 00:22:30.972
I'm hungry.

366
00:22:32.167 --> 00:22:34.394
Here we go. Da-hee first.

367
00:22:34.855 --> 00:22:35.855
Got it?

368
00:22:37.254 --> 00:22:40.362
Got it? Hyun-min knows already.

369
00:22:40.715 --> 00:22:44.066
- You can't get this wrong. - This is amazing!

370
00:22:44.091 --> 00:22:45.091
Swag.

371
00:22:45.222 --> 00:22:46.347
One, two, three.

372
00:22:46.372 --> 00:22:49.667
- Sausage stew! - Kimchi stew!

373
00:22:50.605 --> 00:22:52.331
- What did you say? - Sausage stew.

374
00:22:52.356 --> 00:22:53.378
- Sausage stew. - Yes.

375
00:22:53.403 --> 00:22:54.605
- Sausage stew. - Okay.

376
00:22:54.754 --> 00:22:56.511
- It's sausage stew. - The answer is...

377
00:22:56.816 --> 00:22:59.323
- Sausage stew. - You're good at this!

378
00:22:59.348 --> 00:23:03.003
- Hyun-min, you're good at this. - So is Da-hee.

379
00:23:03.028 --> 00:23:05.425
That's why I said it's vague.

380
00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:09.769
- But there's a lot of kimchi in there for sausage stew. - Right. That's why...

381
00:23:10.364 --> 00:23:13.987
(Don't disrespect my olfactory sense.)

382
00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:18.542
(It's also like kimchi stew with sausage in it...?)

383
00:23:18.567 --> 00:23:22.347
- But the smell of sausage is strong. - Next.

384
00:23:22.652 --> 00:23:23.652
Number three.

385
00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:27.605
I'm going to be quick with this one because the smell is certain.

386
00:23:28.863 --> 00:23:29.863
Oh, come on.

387
00:23:30.488 --> 00:23:32.503
It's such a familiar smell that I know what it is.

388
00:23:32.675 --> 00:23:35.198
I didn't know the first two, but I know this one.

389
00:23:35.223 --> 00:23:36.831
- I don't know what it is. - I do!

390
00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:38.964
- One, two, three. - Dumpling soup!

391
00:23:39.363 --> 00:23:42.019
- Ho-dong didn't answer. - Only Hyun-min and Hee-chul answered.

392
00:23:42.044 --> 00:23:44.745
This is the smell I smelled the most often in the waiting room.

393
00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:46.737
It's something you always eat, Ho-dong.

394
00:23:47.347 --> 00:23:50.230
My stylist, please get me a bowl of dumpling soup.

395
00:23:50.255 --> 00:23:52.839
(Seems like Ho-dong's sense of smell isn't that great anymore.)

396
00:23:52.864 --> 00:23:57.019
Hyun-min knows even if I passed by quickly. He knew it right away.

397
00:23:57.044 --> 00:24:00.995
Hyun-min is in the lead. Da-hee is second place.

398
00:24:02.918 --> 00:24:05.761
- Here we go. Oh, this... - Isn't that one too easy?

399
00:24:05.786 --> 00:24:07.777
But it could be confusing.

400
00:24:11.175 --> 00:24:12.347
Wow. It's confusing.

401
00:24:12.372 --> 00:24:14.339
I'll let you smell this one for a while.

402
00:24:14.457 --> 00:24:16.644
Will Hyun-min be able to guess all of them correctly?

403
00:24:16.964 --> 00:24:21.058
- The smell is a bit... - There are two choices.

404
00:24:21.308 --> 00:24:24.714
One, two, three!

405
00:24:24.847 --> 00:24:26.668
- Seafood stew! - Hot and spicy meat stew.

406
00:24:26.761 --> 00:24:29.737
Bean sprout soup.

407
00:24:30.269 --> 00:24:33.550
Wow, Hyun-min! He got it exactly right!

408
00:24:33.808 --> 00:24:36.105
Really? It's not seafood stew?

409
00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:38.308
There's that special savory smell.

410
00:24:38.333 --> 00:24:39.333
Amazing!

411
00:24:40.963 --> 00:24:44.386
(Perfect sense of smell with 100% accuracy!)

412
00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:50.972
It's really confusing because it smells like dried pollack soup.

413
00:24:50.997 --> 00:24:53.644
Then it would smell fishy.

414
00:24:54.605 --> 00:24:59.925
- Hyun-min, you're incredible. - It's been a while since a guest got it perfect.

415
00:25:01.683 --> 00:25:06.144
- You did really well! Perfect! - If we bet our watches, we would've lost them.

416
00:25:07.129 --> 00:25:12.735
We'll go with strengths next. Da-hee first. This isn't easy.

417
00:25:12.868 --> 00:25:16.073
She wants to play the singing word game. She wants you to come at her.

418
00:25:16.098 --> 00:25:18.066
- We're good at this. - You guys know it, right?

419
00:25:18.091 --> 00:25:20.750
- Who did you play this with? - Who?

420
00:25:20.775 --> 00:25:22.909
I can't practice with anyone, so I do it myself.

421
00:25:23.011 --> 00:25:25.159
From now on, there's someone you can practice with.

422
00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:30.987
- Is Jang-hoon good at this, too? - Try it with him.

423
00:25:31.012 --> 00:25:34.448
I'm not good at it!

424
00:25:34.894 --> 00:25:37.542
- Do it for her! - Just try it once.

425
00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:40.144
We'll play with the song "I love you, dear."

426
00:25:46.531 --> 00:25:49.073
- I don't know that song. - Then "Kiss Kiss Kiss."

427
00:25:49.457 --> 00:25:50.745
- "Kiss Kiss Kiss?" - Okay.

428
00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:58.894
He got it wrong!

429
00:25:59.707 --> 00:26:02.652
I'm happy you won.

430
00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:09.140
(Heart-fluttering Giant)

431
00:26:09.961 --> 00:26:12.417
(What do I do?)

432
00:26:12.979 --> 00:26:15.855
- You know Jang-hoon never loses to anyone? - Really?

433
00:26:17.556 --> 00:26:20.558
(The word 'lose' isn't in his dictionary./Complain.)

434
00:26:20.583 --> 00:26:23.636
What the heck?

435
00:26:23.871 --> 00:26:26.925
You're not my style either! Don't make me laugh!

436
00:26:27.121 --> 00:26:29.339
Forget it! Geez!

437
00:26:30.142 --> 00:26:33.697
(Our Jang-hoon changed!)

438
00:26:33.722 --> 00:26:36.189
I don't know if it's just for broadcast or not,

439
00:26:36.214 --> 00:26:38.629
but you have all the qualities Jang-hoon likes.

440
00:26:39.136 --> 00:26:41.581
You have good reactions, and you're active.

441
00:26:42.785 --> 00:26:43.894
What about Hyun-min?

442
00:26:44.909 --> 00:26:50.854
His strength is that he'll show us the confidence of a top model since he's a model.

443
00:26:51.175 --> 00:26:53.855
I don't know what this means. What are you going to show us?

444
00:26:53.957 --> 00:26:54.957
Walking!

445
00:26:55.449 --> 00:26:58.864
You know how Jang Yoon-joo and Han Hye-Jin came on the show and

446
00:26:58.889 --> 00:27:02.090
showed off their walking, posing, and quick dressing skills?

447
00:27:02.541 --> 00:27:04.995
I'll show walking and quick dressing skills at the same time.

448
00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:06.722
You're going to change while walking?

449
00:27:06.832 --> 00:27:10.029
I'm going to dress, walk, pose, go through the

450
00:27:10.053 --> 00:27:13.113
back, change, and walk again within a minute.

451
00:27:13.138 --> 00:27:16.691
- You'll do that in a minute? - He's showing us the backstage of modeling.

452
00:27:17.621 --> 00:27:20.222
- So we can witness the backstage of modeling. - Of course.

453
00:27:21.504 --> 00:27:23.316
Get ready! Hyun-min, you ready?

454
00:27:23.777 --> 00:27:26.636
The music is ready, right? Let's go!

455
00:27:27.948 --> 00:27:29.652
So this is the fashion runway?

456
00:27:30.941 --> 00:27:32.534
Wow. Look how tall he is.

457
00:27:35.229 --> 00:27:41.222
(The playful Hyun-min is gone...and he transformed into a professional model!)

458
00:27:42.103 --> 00:27:43.917
(Exuding charisma)

459
00:27:46.554 --> 00:27:49.573
(He exits the runway with a carelessly and coolly...)

460
00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:54.456
(He speeds towards the dressing room!)

461
00:27:54.816 --> 00:27:57.050
Why is the way he runs so funny?

462
00:27:58.254 --> 00:28:00.566
We're seeing the backstage of a model.

463
00:28:00.769 --> 00:28:01.836
What's the time?

464
00:28:02.737 --> 00:28:07.081
We're starting to time him now. He wore a lot of clothes.

465
00:28:07.745 --> 00:28:10.784
(It's an emergency backstage.)

466
00:28:11.952 --> 00:28:15.839
(He changes to the next attire without wasting any time.)

467
00:28:19.488 --> 00:28:21.705
(Done getting ready!)

468
00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:22.730
Here we go! Go!

469
00:28:22.755 --> 00:28:25.237
(Carelss walking as if was never in a rush)

470
00:28:25.262 --> 00:28:26.262
Here we go! Go!

471
00:28:29.707 --> 00:28:30.707
He looks cool!

472
00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:38.948
(Charisma that takes over the runway)

473
00:28:41.027 --> 00:28:46.220
Now it's the backstage.

474
00:28:46.245 --> 00:28:48.464
(He runs as fast as he can with his long legs!)

475
00:28:49.449 --> 00:28:53.042
- He's quick. - Why is his running so funny?

476
00:28:55.308 --> 00:28:57.995
He has to hurry up and come out now if he's a model.

477
00:28:59.465 --> 00:29:02.300
Someone drag out the time for him! Hee-chul!

478
00:29:03.347 --> 00:29:08.886
Here's the uniform model Kim Hee-chul. Kyung-hoon, you help out, too.

479
00:29:12.793 --> 00:29:14.323
Hurry up and come back!

480
00:29:14.348 --> 00:29:16.698
(Model Hyun-min returns!)

481
00:29:17.097 --> 00:29:18.730
What the heck? Did he fail to dress?

482
00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:20.628
I don't think you dressed!

483
00:29:20.653 --> 00:29:23.862
(Extreme runway where everything is unbuttoned)

484
00:29:24.316 --> 00:29:26.495
- Hey! - But he's really charismatic!

485
00:29:27.621 --> 00:29:28.754
Did he wear less?

486
00:29:29.465 --> 00:29:32.745
What the heck is that? Is this fake?

487
00:29:32.869 --> 00:29:36.964
- Is this the finale? - Give him a round of applause!

488
00:29:36.989 --> 00:29:40.550
- Hey, hold on. - What happened at the last part?

489
00:29:40.879 --> 00:29:41.879
This is style.

490
00:29:42.816 --> 00:29:46.441
- I guess all you need to do is persist. - If I dress like that, I'll be arrested.

491
00:29:46.683 --> 00:29:50.237
Vintage is the trend these days.

492
00:29:50.262 --> 00:29:52.331
Really? Then let's all take off our clothes, too.

493
00:29:52.356 --> 00:29:56.855
- Welcome to our school! - Welcome!

494
00:29:57.019 --> 00:29:58.019
You got in!

495
00:30:00.995 --> 00:30:03.152
I'm warning you beforehand...

496
00:30:03.465 --> 00:30:07.152
If you get it wrong or say ridiculous things, I'm going to hit you very hard!

497
00:30:08.957 --> 00:30:11.066
You can't hit Hyun-min hard. His fire will go off.

498
00:30:12.204 --> 00:30:14.386
(Let's protect the torch.)

499
00:30:14.926 --> 00:30:17.253
(She burst into laughter again.)

500
00:30:17.597 --> 00:30:20.308
She just cracks up whenever we mention a torch.

501
00:30:22.246 --> 00:30:24.566
- I'll give you the first question then. - Okay.

502
00:30:25.222 --> 00:30:29.370
When I was in first grade,

503
00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:33.667
the most embarrassing thing in my life happened.

504
00:30:33.699 --> 00:30:35.675
- First grade...  What was it?

505
00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:38.784
- If you can get that embarrassed in first grade... - It was in first grade.

506
00:30:38.894 --> 00:30:41.566
The only embarrassing thing in elementary school is that.

507
00:30:41.591 --> 00:30:45.948
- Bathroom. - You went...in your pants.

508
00:30:47.488 --> 00:30:49.918
Whether it was number one or number two, you

509
00:30:49.942 --> 00:30:52.371
couldn't tell your teacher, so you just went.

510
00:30:52.589 --> 00:30:54.355
- It must be right. - In first grade.

511
00:30:55.464 --> 00:30:57.292
- Wrong! - Whoa. She hits hard.

512
00:30:57.925 --> 00:31:02.917
You didn't bring your feces bag, so the teacher told you to get it at school.

513
00:31:03.753 --> 00:31:05.503
- There were parasites in there? - And?

514
00:31:06.988 --> 00:31:08.128
What's a feces bag?

515
00:31:08.714 --> 00:31:11.902
- Long time ago, they checked your poop. - Feces.

516
00:31:12.254 --> 00:31:14.612
- For parasites. - They don't do it nowadays.

517
00:31:15.136 --> 00:31:17.722
You need to poop at home and bring it to school.

518
00:31:17.747 --> 00:31:19.080
- Seriously? - Yeah.

519
00:31:19.753 --> 00:31:22.073
- I didn't know. - It was for parasites.

520
00:31:22.098 --> 00:31:24.941
- You were tall in elementary school, right? - Yeah.

521
00:31:25.074 --> 00:31:26.144
- I know. - What?

522
00:31:26.169 --> 00:31:31.230
You went to the market with your mom, and an employee was like, "Ma'am, try this."

523
00:31:31.255 --> 00:31:33.987
- To an elementary school student? - She said she was tall.

524
00:31:34.012 --> 00:31:37.683
- That makes no sense! - I respect your imagination.

525
00:31:37.847 --> 00:31:39.261
No. Just stay still.

526
00:31:41.073 --> 00:31:45.269
You were walking in the hallway, and since you were tall, the principal told you,

527
00:31:45.558 --> 00:31:48.034
"Which room are you the home teacher of?"

528
00:31:48.542 --> 00:31:50.745
"Ms. Lee, why aren't you teaching in class?"

529
00:31:51.815 --> 00:31:54.800
Our new teacher Ms. Lee.

530
00:31:54.825 --> 00:31:56.417
"You need to go to class."

531
00:31:56.442 --> 00:31:57.691
- I'll give you a hint. - Okay.

532
00:31:57.716 --> 00:32:02.386
- It was an annual event at school. - Sports festival.

533
00:32:02.457 --> 00:32:03.457
Picnic.

534
00:32:03.752 --> 00:32:08.308
I know! You had to throw something at the container, but you brought it down instead.

535
00:32:08.333 --> 00:32:11.042
All the other kids were throwing it, but you were like, "Gosh."

536
00:32:11.067 --> 00:32:13.284
So you took it down and kicked it!

537
00:32:14.043 --> 00:32:15.043
Wrong!

538
00:32:15.068 --> 00:32:17.120
I know! You couldn't fit into your gym clothes, so

539
00:32:17.144 --> 00:32:19.074
you just did sports wearing your school uniform.

540
00:32:19.581 --> 00:32:23.378
Seo Jang-hoon was a star at that time. So people called her Seo Jang-hoon!

541
00:32:24.652 --> 00:32:27.652
"Seo Jang-hoon! Seo Jang-hoon!"

542
00:32:29.035 --> 00:32:32.269
- "Marry Seo Jang-hoon!" - Ho-dong, take off your hat.

543
00:32:32.294 --> 00:32:33.294
Okay.

544
00:32:33.319 --> 00:32:35.362
- Wrong! - Swag.

545
00:32:35.387 --> 00:32:37.620
- You were called Han Ki-bum! - No!

546
00:32:38.058 --> 00:32:41.675
- What do you do at a sports festival? - Relay race.

547
00:32:42.019 --> 00:32:45.355
You were running during the relay race, but you fell and your nose bled!

548
00:32:45.621 --> 00:32:52.987
But that's a common occurrence. I don't think falling is really embarrassing.

549
00:32:53.097 --> 00:32:55.550
You had to run one lap, but you ran two.

550
00:32:56.261 --> 00:32:58.550
- Even though it was over, you kept running. - That's...

551
00:32:58.668 --> 00:32:59.915
Watch. She's supposed to run.

552
00:33:00.316 --> 00:33:04.089
You're supposed to get the baton like this and run, but she got it like this.

553
00:33:04.682 --> 00:33:06.409
So she got it and ran the other way.

554
00:33:07.222 --> 00:33:10.456
The other children were running towards her, so she was like, "What's going on?"

555
00:33:10.481 --> 00:33:11.481
I know!

556
00:33:11.574 --> 00:33:14.870
You ran with the other team's baton!

557
00:33:15.269 --> 00:33:16.469
Soo-geun is close!

558
00:33:16.871 --> 00:33:24.746
So you took the baton, ran the other way, and did a u-turn, but you lost.

559
00:33:25.472 --> 00:33:26.472
Bingo!

560
00:33:29.815 --> 00:33:32.073
- Then what about Soo-geun? - Young-chul got it right!

561
00:33:32.527 --> 00:33:34.878
The important thing is that I lost!

562
00:33:35.181 --> 00:33:38.269
Of course you lost because you went the opposite way!

563
00:33:38.511 --> 00:33:41.683
The twist would be if you won!

564
00:33:41.708 --> 00:33:44.097
- Now you know how I feel, right? - Totally!

565
00:33:44.122 --> 00:33:46.714
- Do you understand those feelings or not? - I do.

566
00:33:46.739 --> 00:33:49.003
- Your team was winning, right? - Yeah.

567
00:33:49.028 --> 00:33:50.870
But they lost because of you.

568
00:33:50.895 --> 00:33:54.784
I was getting ready to run, but you don't really know what's going on in first grade.

569
00:33:54.809 --> 00:33:59.402
So I got the baton and started to run backwards.

570
00:33:59.427 --> 00:34:05.245
My dad told me to go the other way, so I went back.

571
00:34:05.394 --> 00:34:09.472
But there was too much of a difference, so I lost.

572
00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:11.948
This is something that happened to me at a sports festival.

573
00:34:11.973 --> 00:34:13.722
I lived apart from my mom, you know?

574
00:34:13.949 --> 00:34:17.761
- One day, my mom came to the sports festival. - Really?

575
00:34:17.786 --> 00:34:21.472
I'm a quick runner, but that day, everyone burst into laughter.

576
00:34:22.082 --> 00:34:23.644
All the teachers were cracking up.

577
00:34:23.669 --> 00:34:26.214
I was first place, so all the kids were running behind me.

578
00:34:26.239 --> 00:34:28.027
My mom was under the chin-up bar.

579
00:34:28.425 --> 00:34:30.784
So I just ran towards her and not on the track.

580
00:34:31.191 --> 00:34:35.378
The most important thing is that all the other kids started to follow me.

581
00:34:35.785 --> 00:34:39.628
My mom was like, "Go that way! Not here!"

582
00:34:39.653 --> 00:34:44.105
But when I was running to my mom, all the other kids followed me.

583
00:34:45.066 --> 00:34:50.667
It could be a sad story, but I was so surprised she was here.

584
00:34:50.691 --> 00:34:52.384
You're the Pied Pier.

585
00:34:52.658 --> 00:34:54.368
I was so shocked my mom was there.

586
00:34:54.393 --> 00:34:57.009
Do you have any stories from sports festivals?

587
00:34:57.197 --> 00:35:00.602
In sixth grade, I became the school president for the first time.

588
00:35:02.103 --> 00:35:05.304
So I told my mom she had to come to the sports

589
00:35:05.329 --> 00:35:08.392
festival, so she came even though she worked.

590
00:35:08.626 --> 00:35:11.309
Since she's the mom of the class president, she

591
00:35:11.335 --> 00:35:14.017
feels like she has to bring something, you know?

592
00:35:14.361 --> 00:35:17.774
So I remember she spent a lot of money and bought a lot of things.

593
00:35:18.812 --> 00:35:20.012
Oh, my. That's it?

594
00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:23.642
(You didn't say anything wrong, but...)

595
00:35:23.667 --> 00:35:25.681
You know how moms of class presidents bring goody

596
00:35:25.706 --> 00:35:27.517
bags of chocolate and give them to the class.

597
00:35:27.542 --> 00:35:30.837
We need to be understanding.

598
00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:35.595
When we listen to him like the other adult guests, the story becomes a bit...

599
00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:38.110
It's a bit bland. There's no MSG.

600
00:35:38.135 --> 00:35:42.681
But we're forgetting that he's currently a high school student.

601
00:35:42.876 --> 00:35:45.774
- We keep forgetting that. - He just became a junior in high school.

602
00:35:45.799 --> 00:35:48.743
- His stories are very pure. - They're very innocent.

603
00:35:49.329 --> 00:35:52.899
Is there something uncomfortable about being tall when you act?

604
00:35:53.486 --> 00:35:55.017
Being tall is a good thing, right?

605
00:35:55.042 --> 00:35:57.133
In the beginning, many directors didn't want

606
00:35:57.158 --> 00:35:59.155
- to cast me because of my height. - Why not?

607
00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:02.611
The directors said I was too tall for the guys, so

608
00:36:02.636 --> 00:36:05.931
- I failed many auditions. - That's understandable.

609
00:36:05.956 --> 00:36:10.774
But usually girls have to wear heels, and their feet will hurt.

610
00:36:10.799 --> 00:36:14.415
But for me, I just stand with my legs apart like this.

611
00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:17.102
The male actors acting with you must be sad...

612
00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:21.289
- But I have to match their height. - For kiss scenes, it's like...

613
00:36:21.314 --> 00:36:24.313
Then the male actors will start crying.

614
00:36:24.673 --> 00:36:27.243
They'll do that if they're as short as Soo-geun.

615
00:36:27.268 --> 00:36:29.462
What you just said was utterly rude.

616
00:36:30.384 --> 00:36:33.329
You're disrespecting him too much.

617
00:36:33.354 --> 00:36:36.384
It's okay if Soo-geun says that, but it was wrong of you to say it.

618
00:36:36.409 --> 00:36:41.392
I seriously think I should file a complaint.

619
00:36:41.417 --> 00:36:44.251
He always teases me about my height.

620
00:36:45.494 --> 00:36:48.751
It's a giant!

621
00:36:48.776 --> 00:36:51.032
You're definitely two meters, right?

622
00:36:52.586 --> 00:36:54.186
I can use you as a pillar for my house.

623
00:36:55.072 --> 00:36:56.977
Why is a pole walking around?

624
00:36:57.002 --> 00:36:59.415
Chun-yang, here I am!

625
00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:03.595
Hurry up and go! The audience will be here! You need to act as a gingko tree!

626
00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:05.884
He's a jayu ghost!

627
00:37:08.408 --> 00:37:09.970
He teased me five million times.

628
00:37:09.995 --> 00:37:12.524
I did nothing, so why are you bringing that up?

629
00:37:12.549 --> 00:37:16.938
It's up to you if you don't want to apologize.

630
00:37:16.963 --> 00:37:19.931
I think it'd be better for you to apologize.

631
00:37:20.267 --> 00:37:21.751
He apologized way too many times.

632
00:37:23.487 --> 00:37:24.892
(Slightly guilty)

633
00:37:24.917 --> 00:37:26.962
There are more people who aren't 180 centimeters.

634
00:37:26.987 --> 00:37:28.720
(I sincerely apologize...)

635
00:37:28.978 --> 00:37:32.626
When you apologize to short people, you must lower yourself to 160 centimeters.

636
00:37:33.322 --> 00:37:35.509
You weren't humble just now.

637
00:37:36.447 --> 00:37:40.009
- Gosh. - Did you ever fight with your boyfriends about your height?

638
00:37:40.197 --> 00:37:43.173
I always wear sneakers, but you want to wear heels sometimes, you know?

639
00:37:43.369 --> 00:37:47.931
- So when I do wear heels, I don't feel happy that day. - Because you'll be 190 then.

640
00:37:48.189 --> 00:37:51.477
- So later on... - Is he an actor or a singer?

641
00:37:52.392 --> 00:37:53.525
No! He's nothing!

642
00:37:55.181 --> 00:38:00.337
- So then... - How could a person be nothing?

643
00:38:00.595 --> 00:38:02.798
So if you're not an actor or singer, you're nothing?

644
00:38:02.823 --> 00:38:07.095
- You're too much! - No!

645
00:38:08.064 --> 00:38:09.532
(Troubled)

646
00:38:09.557 --> 00:38:11.556
- Hurry up and apologize. - It's up to you.

647
00:38:11.581 --> 00:38:13.448
You don't have to apologize.

648
00:38:14.861 --> 00:38:15.861
What the heck?

649
00:38:16.810 --> 00:38:19.438
(Her footsteps go forward without her knowing.)

650
00:38:20.423 --> 00:38:24.962
I sincerely apologize about calling people who aren't actors or singers nothing.

651
00:38:25.869 --> 00:38:27.681
- She's nice. - Yeah.

652
00:38:27.822 --> 00:38:32.876
But my boyfriends always gift sneakers to me.

653
00:38:33.962 --> 00:38:36.915
- They were sensitive. - Da-hee, wear 20 centimeter heels.

654
00:38:37.970 --> 00:38:39.493
(Heart flutter!)

655
00:38:41.767 --> 00:38:44.813
How many guys can say that in Korea?

656
00:38:44.838 --> 00:38:49.813
"Mr. Seo, you have a date with Lee Da-hee tomorrow."

657
00:38:49.838 --> 00:38:57.704
How tall is she with 20 centimeter heels? Won't she just be 196 centimeters?

658
00:38:59.063 --> 00:39:00.735
- He's amazing. - Next problem.

659
00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:02.196
I'll give you the next problem.

660
00:39:05.189 --> 00:39:07.509
I debuted as a model.

661
00:39:07.869 --> 00:39:12.001
But I went to one fashion show and grew too anxious to go back.

662
00:39:12.478 --> 00:39:13.478
Why?

663
00:39:14.376 --> 00:39:17.517
Hyun-min has an advantage on this one. Have you ever gotten anxious before?

664
00:39:17.861 --> 00:39:19.524
Me? I almost did.

665
00:39:19.836 --> 00:39:24.368
It's even more dangerous for girls, but there are times when your shoe might fall off.

666
00:39:24.642 --> 00:39:26.985
- It gets really awkward then. - That makes you anxious...?

667
00:39:27.533 --> 00:39:28.533
That's it.

668
00:39:28.558 --> 00:39:29.758
It's very awkward.

669
00:39:29.877 --> 00:39:33.204
- Like you didn't fall or anything but you got anxious? - He's only a junior.

670
00:39:33.743 --> 00:39:37.587
So I think your shoe fell off while you were walking.

671
00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:39.648
No. That's not it.

672
00:39:39.672 --> 00:39:41.306
- Hit him hard, too. - Not his head.

673
00:39:41.533 --> 00:39:44.735
- It's fine. - I think he has a cushion on his head though.

674
00:39:44.891 --> 00:39:46.845
Hit him there.

675
00:39:46.986 --> 00:39:49.056
Wrong!

676
00:39:51.251 --> 00:39:52.618
I don't feel anything.

677
00:39:53.478 --> 00:39:56.649
You were walking on the runway when you tripped.

678
00:39:56.837 --> 00:39:59.095
But instinctively, you cursed.

679
00:39:59.861 --> 00:40:01.306
So you were like...

680
00:40:02.561 --> 00:40:04.454
(She approaches him without a word.)

681
00:40:04.986 --> 00:40:05.986
No!

682
00:40:07.369 --> 00:40:10.782
As you were walking, you tripped and you went like this...

683
00:40:11.969 --> 00:40:17.056
- Thanks, Hyun-min. - Hyun-min likes it.

684
00:40:17.081 --> 00:40:18.962
So kids like this. This was funny, right?

685
00:40:20.228 --> 00:40:21.852
She tripped and went like this.

686
00:40:21.877 --> 00:40:24.399
(Just my style!)

687
00:40:26.556 --> 00:40:29.759
Even though he's short, with that kind of humor, he could be on the runway.

688
00:40:31.202 --> 00:40:33.712
(Fierce praise!)

689
00:40:33.737 --> 00:40:35.376
He said Soo-geun could be on the runway.

690
00:40:36.681 --> 00:40:38.587
Height is nothing but a number.

691
00:40:39.134 --> 00:40:41.767
You have no right to say that.

692
00:40:41.792 --> 00:40:44.274
- Anyways, it's wrong. - You apologize, too.

693
00:40:47.258 --> 00:40:50.058
- What are the basis of models? - Walking.

694
00:40:50.649 --> 00:40:51.876
Think about that.

695
00:40:52.673 --> 00:40:55.212
You have a swaggering gait.

696
00:40:59.251 --> 00:41:01.798
Wrong! It's similar though!

697
00:41:02.322 --> 00:41:06.290
I know. Your foot and arm have to be in coordination when walking.

698
00:41:06.947 --> 00:41:09.477
You're supposed to walk like this, but you walked like this.

699
00:41:10.407 --> 00:41:11.407
"What do I do?"

700
00:41:14.665 --> 00:41:16.642
Bingo! You got it!

701
00:41:17.165 --> 00:41:19.931
- Really? - Seriously? I got it right.

702
00:41:20.244 --> 00:41:23.415
Yeah! I became so nervous...

703
00:41:23.494 --> 00:41:27.352
You're supposed to walk in like this,

704
00:41:27.619 --> 00:41:30.548
but I was so anxious and young back then that I did this...

705
00:41:33.626 --> 00:41:35.337
That's natural!

706
00:41:36.759 --> 00:41:41.274
But the funny thing is that no one knew that, not even the senior models.

707
00:41:41.299 --> 00:41:46.306
But the teacher who taught walking was like, "Hold up. Her walking is off."

708
00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:50.243
Back then, there were many famous models like Jang Yoon-joo.

709
00:41:50.908 --> 00:41:52.118
They laughed a lot.

710
00:41:52.143 --> 00:41:56.134
When you're on the runway, hardly anyone walks like this.

711
00:41:56.159 --> 00:41:58.227
- He's making fun of you right now. - No!

712
00:41:58.579 --> 00:42:04.274
In my days, you were supposed to walk like this.

713
00:42:04.689 --> 00:42:06.892
- Like this. - She's really good.

714
00:42:07.783 --> 00:42:09.649
- How do you walk these days? - These days...

715
00:42:09.674 --> 00:42:12.517
- What about these days? - Long time ago, it was formal walking.

716
00:42:12.783 --> 00:42:14.720
- Nowadays, you need feel. - Feel?

717
00:42:14.745 --> 00:42:20.181
With feel and individual style, anyone can go on the runway. Even Soo-geun.

718
00:42:22.934 --> 00:42:25.977
(You're making fun of me, right?)

719
00:42:26.462 --> 00:42:29.102
So nowadays, you walk like this...

720
00:42:29.486 --> 00:42:30.886
Here comes the torch.

721
00:42:33.095 --> 00:42:36.024
Hey, how can you crack up in the middle of walking?

722
00:42:36.392 --> 00:42:39.196
- You ruined the show. - I won't do it anymore.

723
00:42:40.325 --> 00:42:42.360
(Laughing so hard without making a sound)

724
00:42:42.385 --> 00:42:44.118
(Suppressing his laughter)

725
00:42:44.681 --> 00:42:46.079
It's true. There's nothing to it.

726
00:42:47.455 --> 00:42:50.860
Isn't it too simple, Hyun-min? It's totally free.

727
00:42:51.087 --> 00:42:53.556
It has become a very simple generation.

728
00:42:53.581 --> 00:42:55.079
I'll give you the next question.

729
00:42:56.494 --> 00:43:00.369
I'm greedy about being on stage, as you guys have seen earlier.

730
00:43:00.619 --> 00:43:06.103
But I think it's because of an occurrence that happened in elementary school.

731
00:43:06.822 --> 00:43:08.829
- What is it? - Many things happened to you then.

732
00:43:08.854 --> 00:43:10.939
- Yes, I have many memories during then. - I know.

733
00:43:11.213 --> 00:43:14.236
You left home in elementary school.

734
00:43:14.596 --> 00:43:17.009
But in the stage of the world...

735
00:43:17.728 --> 00:43:20.111
you wanted to be the center of attention.

736
00:43:20.136 --> 00:43:23.806
(At age 10...I was greedy for the stage of life...)

737
00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:27.978
(He's bewildered when he's the one who said it.)

738
00:43:28.626 --> 00:43:31.150
Isn't the furthest you can go during then the playground?

739
00:43:32.818 --> 00:43:34.689
(It's definitely wrong!)

740
00:43:34.714 --> 00:43:36.697
- That's creativity right there. - Wrong.

741
00:43:36.722 --> 00:43:40.759
- You and I don't have a big age difference. - How old are you?

742
00:43:40.963 --> 00:43:42.744
- I'm 36. - 36?

743
00:43:42.955 --> 00:43:44.220
36. 35. 34.

744
00:43:44.245 --> 00:43:47.869
In elementary school, songs from Roo'ra were always at school arts festival.

745
00:43:48.299 --> 00:43:52.744
You performed then, and your classmates adored it.

746
00:43:53.947 --> 00:43:56.923
They were like, "You're prettier than Kim Ji-hyun!"

747
00:43:57.455 --> 00:43:58.501
I think I'm right.

748
00:43:58.806 --> 00:44:01.658
The way she's drinking water means you're close.

749
00:44:01.892 --> 00:44:05.744
That's good, but be more specific.

750
00:44:05.769 --> 00:44:08.579
- I'm getting mad. - He must be close then.

751
00:44:08.604 --> 00:44:10.767
Maybe it's a different singer then.

752
00:44:11.142 --> 00:44:12.142
No way...

753
00:44:12.986 --> 00:44:15.494
Did you wear fur and sing a song from BROS?

754
00:44:15.970 --> 00:44:17.275
(Of course not!)

755
00:44:19.728 --> 00:44:20.728
No!

756
00:44:21.228 --> 00:44:25.158
You guys are close. Roo'ra's what?

757
00:44:25.307 --> 00:44:26.392
"Angel Who Lost Wings!"

758
00:44:26.417 --> 00:44:29.798
"Angel Who Lost Wings" became a real hit.

759
00:44:30.033 --> 00:44:35.978
So you would always dance the choreography at home and school.

760
00:44:37.314 --> 00:44:38.798
It has to do with that song.

761
00:44:39.096 --> 00:44:40.429
- You got it. - Wow.

762
00:44:42.892 --> 00:44:45.513
I danced to it for the first time at a school

763
00:44:45.538 --> 00:44:48.158
arts festival, and the reaction was explosive.

764
00:44:48.183 --> 00:44:52.171
So when students passed me by, they would recognize me

765
00:44:52.384 --> 00:44:56.111
and go, "That's the girl who danced to Roo'ra's song."

766
00:44:56.136 --> 00:44:57.462
You played Kim Ji-hyun's role?

767
00:44:57.666 --> 00:45:00.384
Back then, four girls danced together.

768
00:45:00.752 --> 00:45:04.400
Sang-min was super unpopular. No one wanted to be him.

769
00:45:05.338 --> 00:45:07.986
No one wants to rap like him, you know?

770
00:45:08.011 --> 00:45:10.712
Long time ago, at a fan sign, the fans had

771
00:45:10.737 --> 00:45:12.900
to stand in front of the four of us in order.

772
00:45:12.925 --> 00:45:14.900
The fans who had to stand in front of me cried.

773
00:45:16.571 --> 00:45:18.095
That's too much!

774
00:45:18.376 --> 00:45:20.876
- Who did they want an autograph from? - Ji-hyun or Ri-Na.

775
00:45:20.901 --> 00:45:24.962
- That's right. - Hyun-min, what song was popular when you were in elementary school?

776
00:45:26.041 --> 00:45:27.283
Big Bang's "Lollipop?"

777
00:45:29.181 --> 00:45:30.798
It was Roo'ra for us

778
00:45:31.361 --> 00:45:33.517
That's different. Ours was Jeon Yu-Na.

779
00:45:34.033 --> 00:45:35.384
"I Still Love You."

780
00:45:36.314 --> 00:45:38.736
When we were young, we only sang sad songs.

781
00:45:42.892 --> 00:45:47.501
The most exciting song was Kim Bum-ryong's "Wind Wind Wind."

782
00:45:54.885 --> 00:45:56.892
You sing those kind of songs in elementary school?

783
00:45:59.782 --> 00:46:01.572
It was famous back then.

784
00:46:01.799 --> 00:46:06.111
- What song was famous in middle school for you? - That was two years ago.

785
00:46:06.136 --> 00:46:07.136
That's true.

786
00:46:07.161 --> 00:46:11.517
- Isn't that when TWICE's "Cheer Up" came about? - That's right. TWICE exploded then.

787
00:46:12.428 --> 00:46:13.548
(Shocked)

788
00:46:14.096 --> 00:46:16.634
- The girls in TWICE are all older than you. - Right.

789
00:46:17.345 --> 00:46:21.665
- In our days, Kim Soo-hee's "Yoke" was famous. - "Yoke."

790
00:46:24.672 --> 00:46:27.055
(The same-age friends are immersed in their past memories.)

791
00:46:28.069 --> 00:46:30.766
(Excellent job, Young-chul)

792
00:46:31.892 --> 00:46:34.298
There was Yoon Shi-nae, too.

793
00:46:35.308 --> 00:46:38.774
("To the DJ" - Yoon Shi-nae)

794
00:46:39.745 --> 00:46:42.783
(The bros are immersed in their past.)

795
00:46:43.558 --> 00:46:45.603
(She's just watching because she's amazed.)

796
00:46:51.592 --> 00:46:55.751
(What middle school students were like back then. avi)

797
00:46:57.961 --> 00:47:01.158
("Let's study" - Yoon Shi-nae)

798
00:47:09.791 --> 00:47:16.056
You know the displays of old dolls in Korean Folk Village?

799
00:47:16.213 --> 00:47:19.626
Hyun-min, these are old people. They're our ancestors.

800
00:47:21.307 --> 00:47:24.040
(Who cares!)

801
00:47:24.408 --> 00:47:27.712
Then suddenly, Lee Sun-hee came about.

802
00:47:28.126 --> 00:47:31.111
"To J." She totally swept the charts!

803
00:47:36.898 --> 00:47:39.087
(Completely possessed!)

804
00:47:40.144 --> 00:47:43.134
(For today, I'm proud of my friend Young-chul.)

805
00:47:43.159 --> 00:47:44.426
"Ah! The Old Days!"

806
00:47:49.619 --> 00:47:50.728
(Amazed)

807
00:47:58.962 --> 00:48:00.822
(Young-chul's Dinner Show!)

808
00:48:02.188 --> 00:48:04.806
Good job. Because of me...

809
00:48:07.072 --> 00:48:10.189
It's been a while since our jukebox played.

810
00:48:10.361 --> 00:48:13.439
But I remember Kyung-hoon's songs when I debuted.

811
00:48:13.464 --> 00:48:17.619
- Buzz's "Maybe." It was popular when I debuted. - Sing it.

812
00:48:25.142 --> 00:48:27.408
- I know it all. - You're good at singing that song.

813
00:48:27.822 --> 00:48:29.486
From now on, sing this song.

814
00:48:30.096 --> 00:48:31.986
I've heard of his vocal mimicry, too.

815
00:48:32.011 --> 00:48:33.978
He knows your songs from the imitations.

816
00:48:34.205 --> 00:48:37.665
- You know it? - You know "Coward?"

817
00:48:39.049 --> 00:48:40.337
You sang that song?

818
00:48:40.947 --> 00:48:43.876
- He's the one who sang that song! - How do you know about it?

819
00:48:44.189 --> 00:48:46.869
- My friends always sing it at karaoke rooms. - They do?

820
00:48:46.894 --> 00:48:48.040
You know that song?

821
00:48:49.517 --> 00:48:51.072
Not that but "You Don't Know Men."

822
00:48:51.665 --> 00:48:53.720
- You know many of my songs. - I sang it like...

823
00:48:57.611 --> 00:49:00.111
(What the heck is that?)

824
00:49:02.524 --> 00:49:05.126
- I'll give you the last question now. - Sure.

825
00:49:05.416 --> 00:49:10.533
The first scene of my first drama was a crying scene.

826
00:49:10.558 --> 00:49:13.999
I was so nervous, so I drank four glasses of soju

827
00:49:14.024 --> 00:49:17.533
and went to the film set, but filming was canceled.

828
00:49:18.728 --> 00:49:20.883
So what did I do?

829
00:49:20.908 --> 00:49:22.936
You went to the director and said, "When are

830
00:49:22.961 --> 00:49:24.853
you going to stop staring at the monitor?

831
00:49:25.955 --> 00:49:27.072
Look at my shoulder."

832
00:49:27.932 --> 00:49:29.064
I dance?

833
00:49:30.791 --> 00:49:33.447
"Director, what did I do wrong?"

834
00:49:34.541 --> 00:49:39.462
It's similar, but put it in a way that's fit for my age back then.

835
00:49:39.861 --> 00:49:42.661
- "Director!" - I know! What was his name?

836
00:49:42.686 --> 00:49:44.400
- Yoo Chul-Yong. - Yoo Chul-Yong.

837
00:49:45.494 --> 00:49:49.306
When he yelled "cut, okay," you went, "Nice one, Director Yoo!"

838
00:49:49.915 --> 00:49:52.150
Think of my age!

839
00:49:52.455 --> 00:49:58.221
"Can't you just film it right now? It's my first time experiencing these feelings!"

840
00:49:58.246 --> 00:50:01.423
Ho-dong, at that time, I met you on "Beautiful Sunday."

841
00:50:01.448 --> 00:50:04.478
But did I have that kind of personality back then? No, I didn't.

842
00:50:04.503 --> 00:50:07.533
- I didn't have the personality to say it like that! - I got it!

843
00:50:07.558 --> 00:50:10.140
I got it. You gained confidence after drinking...

844
00:50:10.564 --> 00:50:11.767
That was a bit strong.

845
00:50:11.792 --> 00:50:12.792
(Sorry.)

846
00:50:12.515 --> 00:50:14.287
- That was hard.
- Just for him.

847
00:50:14.311 --> 00:50:19.498
You were tipsy after drinking and
demanded he give you a bigger role.

848
00:50:20.241 --> 00:50:23.294
- You wanted a bigger role.
- This is easy, why can't you get it?

849
00:50:23.319 --> 00:50:25.561
- I got it.
- You went...

850
00:50:26.490 --> 00:50:28.319
You went to the director and...

851
00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:30.702
(Farts)

852
00:50:31.046 --> 00:50:34.295
(The new actress's shy gas attack)

853
00:50:34.752 --> 00:50:37.819
- Take this, instead.
- Come here, come here.

854
00:50:38.155 --> 00:50:39.608
Respect!

855
00:50:39.897 --> 00:50:41.913
Think of a simple saying.

856
00:50:42.546 --> 00:50:45.530
I said, "Director! Blank, blank!".

857
00:50:45.921 --> 00:50:47.963
"Director! You're a mutt!".

858
00:50:50.343 --> 00:50:52.888
- Give me your hands.
- "You're an idiot! A fool".

859
00:50:52.913 --> 00:50:54.803
- Sea anenome!
- Stupid!

860
00:50:55.147 --> 00:50:56.905
"Director, you're a fool!".

861
00:50:58.101 --> 00:50:59.654
"Director! I hate you!".

862
00:50:59.679 --> 00:51:01.967
- "Director! Please!".
- "Director! I'm mad at you".

863
00:51:01.991 --> 00:51:04.022
- "Director!".
- "I hate you!".

864
00:51:04.124 --> 00:51:07.100
- You got it right!
- What was it?

865
00:51:07.194 --> 00:51:09.288
Didn't I get the tone right?

866
00:51:09.515 --> 00:51:13.600
I had to say, "Bye" to all the staff
members since our shoot was cancelled.

867
00:51:13.757 --> 00:51:17.350
I went to the staff while
I was a bit tipsy.

868
00:51:18.093 --> 00:51:19.413
I went and...

869
00:51:19.976 --> 00:51:23.873
I yelled, "Director! I hate you!"
and ran away from the set.

870
00:51:24.155 --> 00:51:26.834
The staff members that
saw me were shocked...

871
00:51:26.890 --> 00:51:30.248
because everybody in our cast
was afraid of our director.

872
00:51:30.655 --> 00:51:34.631
The director didn't take offense to
what I did since I was so young.

873
00:51:34.882 --> 00:51:41.053
The staff would ask me to tell the
director I hated him, repeatedly.

874
00:51:41.186 --> 00:51:43.483
Have you guys ever
defied authority before?

875
00:51:43.624 --> 00:51:46.225
- You shouldn't do that.
- Of course, not.

876
00:51:46.288 --> 00:51:51.682
Imagine if Jang-hoon said, "Choi Chang-soo!
I hate you!". How scary would that be?

877
00:51:52.257 --> 00:51:55.091
I'm sorry, Seo Jang-hoon. Today's
recording was cancelled suddenly.

878
00:51:55.116 --> 00:51:57.873
Choi Chang-soo! I hate you!

879
00:51:59.608 --> 00:52:02.069
Have you ever been upset, Hyun-min?

880
00:52:02.476 --> 00:52:05.014
Whether it be on a show or
when you were modeling?

881
00:52:05.101 --> 00:52:07.568
I used to not go home and sleep
over at my friend's house.

882
00:52:07.593 --> 00:52:10.959
- You didn't go home? What did you do?
- But, he's so nice.

883
00:52:10.983 --> 00:52:12.630
- I hung out.
- What did you guys do?

884
00:52:12.655 --> 00:52:15.541
- We played 'Prison Escape'.
- I know that game.

885
00:52:15.593 --> 00:52:19.561
You close your eyes and find
your way out of a playground.

886
00:52:19.936 --> 00:52:22.669
You ran away from home to
go play at a playground?

887
00:52:22.694 --> 00:52:24.231
Tell us how you play the game.

888
00:52:24.256 --> 00:52:26.702
Let's say you're at a playground.

889
00:52:27.054 --> 00:52:31.709
You stand in front of the entrance with
your eyes closed, count to 10 and start.

890
00:52:32.257 --> 00:52:35.279
You have 2 opportunities
to use "Wide-Eyed" option.

891
00:52:35.304 --> 00:52:37.522
It only lasts for 2 seconds.

892
00:52:37.882 --> 00:52:41.381
If you're hiding here, I can
yell, "Wide-Eyed" and catch you.

893
00:52:43.194 --> 00:52:45.631
I understand. You can
play that at your age.

894
00:52:45.929 --> 00:52:50.038
You were mad and yelled, "I'm running
away!" and played, "Wide-Eyed"?

895
00:52:50.507 --> 00:52:52.034
There's nothing else I can do.

896
00:52:52.210 --> 00:52:56.909
Are you doing this at a playground or a
playground that's in an apartment complex?

897
00:52:57.124 --> 00:53:00.764
It can be in an apartment
complex or an empty. It varies.

898
00:53:01.249 --> 00:53:03.944
- You sure are innocent. - You need to
use the "Wide-Eyed" opportunity well.

899
00:53:04.007 --> 00:53:08.850
Of course! You have to have good timing.
Who really closes their eyes all the way?

900
00:53:09.085 --> 00:53:12.663
You slightly open your eyes and use
"Wide-Eyed" chance when they're close to you.

901
00:53:12.679 --> 00:53:14.537
Have you slightly opened your eyes as well?

902
00:53:14.561 --> 00:53:17.381
- Of course.
- Isn't that cheating?

903
00:53:17.968 --> 00:53:21.397
The game won't end if you
really have your eyes closed.

904
00:53:21.757 --> 00:53:25.130
- What the heck is that? - Why don't
you play the game with your eyes open?

905
00:53:25.155 --> 00:53:27.100
It's no fun playing with your eyes open.

906
00:53:27.125 --> 00:53:29.882
- It's just a rule they have.
- Good job, Da-hee.

907
00:53:31.639 --> 00:53:32.972
It was fun, Da-hee.

908
00:53:32.997 --> 00:53:36.424
Your turn, Hyun-min. We're
going to get all the answers.

909
00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:37.966
I think it'll be hard for you guys.

910
00:53:37.991 --> 00:53:41.991
- We might not get the answers since...
- He thinks differently than us.

911
00:53:42.218 --> 00:53:44.295
we're not familiar with his world.

912
00:53:44.749 --> 00:53:46.959
- Let's go.
- Han Hyun-min quiz!

913
00:53:48.288 --> 00:53:50.182
Aren't you guys going to clap?

914
00:53:50.382 --> 00:53:52.458
(The high school student is
disappointed from the beginning)

915
00:53:52.483 --> 00:53:54.709
- You need to be louder!
- I'll try it again.

916
00:53:54.843 --> 00:53:57.116
Han Hyun-min's quiz!

917
00:53:58.241 --> 00:54:00.276
- Han Hyun-min quiz.
- How cute.

918
00:54:00.726 --> 00:54:03.545
Remember, how I told you
my father was Nigerian?

919
00:54:03.569 --> 00:54:08.036
We do something often in our house because
of my father. Guess what that is.

920
00:54:08.061 --> 00:54:10.459
I got it! Your father snores too loudly.

921
00:54:12.296 --> 00:54:13.959
No, my mom's snoring is pretty bad.

922
00:54:13.983 --> 00:54:17.772
- My gosh. - Your mom is going to
be shocked when she sees this.

923
00:54:18.054 --> 00:54:20.842
I felt this when I was young,
but I think it's serious.

924
00:54:20.866 --> 00:54:23.752
The bed starts to move when she snores.

925
00:54:25.686 --> 00:54:28.927
- Your mom? Your mom's snoring?
- Her bed starts to move.

926
00:54:28.952 --> 00:54:31.311
He's using his mom to be funny on the show.

927
00:54:31.429 --> 00:54:35.280
- He used his dad, now his mom.
- It can be fixed with simple surgery.

928
00:54:35.632 --> 00:54:37.107
I guess I need to make a lot of money.

929
00:54:37.132 --> 00:54:41.975
I got it. Soccer. Isn't Nigeria
known to play soccer very well?

930
00:54:43.374 --> 00:54:47.452
- I got it! - No. I'm still answering,
Jang-hoon. - Okay, go ahead.

931
00:54:48.218 --> 00:54:50.116
- Go ahead.
- Yeah, go ahead.

932
00:54:50.593 --> 00:54:52.944
Soccer. You play soccer with your dad.

933
00:54:53.819 --> 00:54:55.104
She's very precise.

934
00:54:55.569 --> 00:54:58.108
You play soccer with your dad in the house.

935
00:54:58.413 --> 00:55:01.702
You play soccer with your family.
Every night! Outside.

936
00:55:01.944 --> 00:55:04.669
- No, wait.
- Aren't you taking too many turns?

937
00:55:04.694 --> 00:55:07.489
- Use only one of them!
- I'm sorry, I'll stick to my first answer.

938
00:55:07.515 --> 00:55:10.224
You play soccer inside the
house with your whole family.

939
00:55:10.249 --> 00:55:13.190
Are you allowed to play
soccer in the house?

940
00:55:14.007 --> 00:55:15.764
He sleeps a lot.

941
00:55:16.733 --> 00:55:19.131
He goes to sleep really early.

942
00:55:20.257 --> 00:55:24.514
That's why, the whole family has to
go to bed at about 6 or 7 o'clock.

943
00:55:25.882 --> 00:55:26.882
- Am I right?
- Wrong!

944
00:55:26.968 --> 00:55:29.428
- I got it!
- No, I've got the answer.

945
00:55:29.592 --> 00:55:33.143
I was tricked by a kid! I was
tricked by a high school kid!

946
00:55:33.291 --> 00:55:35.131
I thought I was tricking him!

947
00:55:35.382 --> 00:55:40.256
Your dad eats too many times a day.
He eats morning, noon and night.

948
00:55:40.404 --> 00:55:44.807
Your neighbors come to your house and ask
you to stop since you cook too much.

949
00:55:45.116 --> 00:55:46.755
Can you be more specific?

950
00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:50.686
- It has something to do with food.
- Your father eats too often.

951
00:55:51.554 --> 00:55:54.627
You have to continually eat with him.
Am I right?

952
00:55:55.007 --> 00:55:57.420
- Am I right?
- It's not Nigerian food.

953
00:55:57.897 --> 00:56:00.030
He lived in Korea for a long time.

954
00:56:00.116 --> 00:56:02.615
- Does he eat fermented soy bean stew?
- Something like that.

955
00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:07.272
He likes fermented soy bean stew
so much, he ate it all the time.

956
00:56:07.616 --> 00:56:10.779
He only eats fermented soy bean stew.
365-days a year.

957
00:56:10.804 --> 00:56:13.752
How hard do you think that
makes it for his family?

958
00:56:15.296 --> 00:56:18.416
- Nope.
- It's not soybean stew! It's kimchee stew!

959
00:56:18.632 --> 00:56:21.388
- I got it! It's kimchee stew!
- He tricked me too.

960
00:56:21.413 --> 00:56:24.928
- He only eats soybean soup!
- He's totally into kimchee stew.

961
00:56:25.108 --> 00:56:28.356
Soybean stew! Your father is
totally into soybean stew!

962
00:56:28.382 --> 00:56:30.647
He's so into soybean stew
that he eats it every day!

963
00:56:30.672 --> 00:56:33.014
- You got it.
- It was kimchee stew!

964
00:56:33.038 --> 00:56:37.741
He's so into kimchee stew, that it has
to be on the table 365-days a year.

965
00:56:38.101 --> 00:56:40.889
- You were so close.
- I guess fermented soybean stew.

966
00:56:40.913 --> 00:56:43.124
I should've said kimchee stew.
There's three stews.

967
00:56:43.149 --> 00:56:45.239
Kimchee, fermented soybean
and soybean stew.

968
00:56:45.265 --> 00:56:46.435
He likes kimchee stew that much?

969
00:56:46.460 --> 00:56:49.791
My father won't eat unless
there's spicy food on the table.

970
00:56:50.132 --> 00:56:51.529
That's fascinating.

971
00:56:51.554 --> 00:56:54.022
Does Nigeria have spicy dishes as well?

972
00:56:54.663 --> 00:56:58.747
- I heard there's a chicken stew, but
I've never had it before. - There is.

973
00:56:58.772 --> 00:57:02.077
There's a lot of spicy dishes there.
They had it in Ghana as well.

974
00:57:02.186 --> 00:57:05.333
- Do you eat spicy food as well?
- I'm a total fan of spicy foods.

975
00:57:05.358 --> 00:57:07.317
I add chili powder whenever I have ramen.

976
00:57:07.343 --> 00:57:10.147
- What's your favorite dish?
- It's sausage soup.

977
00:57:10.624 --> 00:57:12.169
Do you eat fermented soybean stew as well?

978
00:57:12.194 --> 00:57:15.600
Of course. I always add Chungyang
peppers to my soybean stew.

979
00:57:15.772 --> 00:57:18.177
- That's good!
- I always put peppers in too.

980
00:57:18.202 --> 00:57:19.888
Do you like naengmyeon?

981
00:57:19.913 --> 00:57:23.599
- There's a restaurant named... Oops, I
shouldn't have said that. - It's okay.

982
00:57:23.624 --> 00:57:25.052
They have delicious naengmyeon there.

983
00:57:25.077 --> 00:57:27.341
It's about 30-seconds away from my house.

984
00:57:27.366 --> 00:57:31.303
When you get a chance, you should
try naengmyeon with bulgogi.

985
00:57:31.874 --> 00:57:36.702
You know how the noodles are bit over the
broth? Place bulgogi on top of that.

986
00:57:36.874 --> 00:57:39.108
Take a bite of noodles with the bulgogi.

987
00:57:39.226 --> 00:57:41.521
It's cold from the noodles
and hot from the bulgogi.

988
00:57:41.546 --> 00:57:45.435
It's perfect because the naengmyeon
is a bit bland and the beef is salty.

989
00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:46.873
- Did you just order that?
- Yes.

990
00:57:46.897 --> 00:57:49.272
Did you guys hear that? Get it ready.

991
00:57:49.913 --> 00:57:51.772
Don't forget the bulgogi!

992
00:57:52.140 --> 00:57:54.858
- If you like Korean food...
- He should still eat at home.

993
00:57:54.897 --> 00:57:56.294
You know what?

994
00:57:56.319 --> 00:58:00.538
You should go to Kim Shin-young
and ask for her radish kimchee.

995
00:58:01.030 --> 00:58:03.310
- Is her radish kimchee good?
- Yeah, it's delicious.

996
00:58:03.335 --> 00:58:05.376
I haven't had it yet,
but I heard it's delicious.

997
00:58:05.401 --> 00:58:07.913
Her grandma
licks the spices for you.

998
00:58:08.452 --> 00:58:10.319
You should ask her for some.

999
00:58:10.460 --> 00:58:12.958
- Don't you guys remember? - I was
wondering what he was talking about.

1000
00:58:12.983 --> 00:58:17.311
- Of course, I remember.
- Radish kimchee is best with ramen.

1001
00:58:17.608 --> 00:58:19.639
Ask the next question, Hyun-min!

1002
00:58:19.843 --> 00:58:24.952
I have a special ability that not many
can imitate. What do you think it is?

1003
00:58:25.726 --> 00:58:28.561
A special ability? Like
your ability to smell?

1004
00:58:29.015 --> 00:58:31.576
- It's a bit different than that.
- He's hiding something.

1005
00:58:31.601 --> 00:58:33.667
Can you hide things in your hair?

1006
00:58:34.366 --> 00:58:37.061
You can hide 50 to 100 pens at a time?

1007
00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:43.171
I think I might be right, but I
didn't say that was my answer yet.

1008
00:58:43.647 --> 00:58:45.257
- Is he right?
- No.

1009
00:58:45.710 --> 00:58:47.194
I think he's right!

1010
00:58:47.382 --> 00:58:50.889
You were shocked that I got close,
didn't you? Are you shocked?

1011
00:58:51.608 --> 00:58:55.397
- Hyun-min! - I saw someone
hiding 30 pens in their hair.

1012
00:58:55.608 --> 00:58:58.327
- I got it! You can hide
things in your hair. - Nope.

1013
00:58:58.507 --> 00:59:01.724
When you play golf, you keep
your ball on your head.

1014
00:59:01.749 --> 00:59:03.826
You only need to carry around your clubs.

1015
00:59:03.851 --> 00:59:07.417
That's why when you play golf,
you hit the ball like this.

1016
00:59:09.741 --> 00:59:14.279
- I'll give you a hint. - It's only funny
because you don't know anything about golf.

1017
00:59:14.304 --> 00:59:17.771
- No one can think of that.
- He doesn't know anything about sports.

1018
00:59:17.796 --> 00:59:19.444
Not one percent.

1019
00:59:20.116 --> 00:59:22.967
Does it have something
to do with your hair?

1020
00:59:23.999 --> 00:59:28.272
Yeah, it does. Are you hiding 3
Iced-Americanos in your hair?

1021
00:59:28.546 --> 00:59:30.702
I'll give you a hint. One hint.

1022
00:59:30.952 --> 00:59:33.518
- The first hint is...
- He must be really shocked.

1023
00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:35.186
Soo-geun would be jealous of me.

1024
00:59:35.397 --> 00:59:38.239
- I'd be jealous of you?
- It has to be about height.

1025
00:59:38.265 --> 00:59:40.705
Height? Is it changing
his height with hair?

1026
00:59:40.890 --> 00:59:44.311
I got it. You can grow 1 inch at any time.

1027
00:59:44.416 --> 00:59:46.708
- That must be it.
- Be more specific.

1028
00:59:46.733 --> 00:59:50.467
- He can automatically... - You can
grow shorter or taller at your will.

1029
00:59:50.757 --> 00:59:52.530
You got it.

1030
00:59:52.593 --> 00:59:54.256
How? How do you do that?

1031
00:59:54.358 --> 00:59:57.100
- It's not by standing taller.
- Then, how?

1032
00:59:59.007 --> 01:00:02.545
It's possible! I can go from
6'2" or 6'3", like this.

1033
01:00:02.697 --> 01:00:06.354
"An astounding theory and
hope for all short people)

1034
01:00:06.679 --> 01:00:09.216
That's why he was surprised when
Soo-geun mentioned his hair.

1035
01:00:09.241 --> 01:00:11.830
I'm showing you how tall I can be today.

1036
01:00:11.999 --> 01:00:15.342
I could tie my hair back if I
wanted to be shorter today.

1037
01:00:15.679 --> 01:00:18.146
- Can you tie your hair?
- Do we have a rubber band?

1038
01:00:18.171 --> 01:00:20.838
- I have one.
- We keep forgetting...

1039
01:00:21.429 --> 01:00:24.709
I keep forgetting that
he's still in high school.

1040
01:00:25.257 --> 01:00:28.513
- How do you tie your hair?
- I was thinking too seriously.

1041
01:00:28.538 --> 01:00:30.889
- Tie his hair for him, Da-hee.
- I don't think it'll work.

1042
01:00:30.914 --> 01:00:32.773
Where did my hair tie go?

1043
01:00:35.311 --> 01:00:37.974
His other special ability is
to hide things in his hair.

1044
01:00:37.999 --> 01:00:39.818
- Can I tie it back, like this?
- Yeah.

1045
01:00:39.843 --> 01:00:43.432
- You look cute, Hyun-min.
- Don't I look like a warrior?

1046
01:00:44.421 --> 01:00:46.272
- A warrior?
- Let's see.

1047
01:00:47.553 --> 01:00:49.608
- How cute!
- Yes! How cute!

1048
01:00:50.101 --> 01:00:52.198
No, you don't look like a warrior.

1049
01:00:52.491 --> 01:00:56.771
- He looks different. - Does this mean
you're 6'3", only on your right-side?

1050
01:00:56.796 --> 01:00:58.936
Yes, if I take out my hair.

1051
01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:01.873
- I'm 6'3" on this side.
- Let's see!

1052
01:01:02.022 --> 01:01:03.364
See, I took out my hair.

1053
01:01:03.390 --> 01:01:06.498
- How cute.
- Look! It's Mickey Mouse!

1054
01:01:07.944 --> 01:01:12.334
(The "Ask Us Anything" members return to
childhood because of cute Mickey Mouse)

1055
01:01:12.694 --> 01:01:15.692
I've had a lot of fun
experiences because of my hair.

1056
01:01:15.718 --> 01:01:19.631
I was eating ramen with my friend when
he stuck a wooden chopstick in my hair.

1057
01:01:19.655 --> 01:01:21.568
I was upset he stuck it in my hair but...

1058
01:01:21.593 --> 01:01:24.006
we kept hanging out and I went home.

1059
01:01:24.030 --> 01:01:26.919
I was taking a shower since
I was out all day but...

1060
01:01:26.944 --> 01:01:30.416
while I was shampooing my hair
the wooden chopstick fell out.

1061
01:01:30.585 --> 01:01:33.287
You forgot? Your friend
didn't put it in secretly.

1062
01:01:33.311 --> 01:01:35.303
I couldn't feel it in my hair.

1063
01:01:37.210 --> 01:01:39.724
- Can you try sticking something
in your hair? - Right now?

1064
01:01:39.749 --> 01:01:42.232
- Is there something I can use?
- Come here, I have something.

1065
01:01:42.257 --> 01:01:45.435
I wanted to try this. Can I try
arranging flowers in your hair?

1066
01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:48.526
- You can put a lot in.
- I think so.

1067
01:01:48.666 --> 01:01:51.311
- They're clean. How about one?
- Why one? Let's put in more.

1068
01:01:51.569 --> 01:01:53.112
It'll go straight in.

1069
01:01:53.745 --> 01:01:54.979
(Goes right in)

1070
01:01:55.766 --> 01:01:57.041
Look over there.

1071
01:01:58.749 --> 01:02:02.146
Hyun-min! It looks like they're
growing out of your hair.

1072
01:02:02.171 --> 01:02:05.037
I remember using foam oasis
for flower arrangements.

1073
01:02:05.062 --> 01:02:08.076
The flowers grow well when you
put a lot of water in it.

1074
01:02:08.101 --> 01:02:11.186
Like you guys mentioned before, my
friends used to hide things as well.

1075
01:02:11.429 --> 01:02:15.592
They'd try to use my hair as a hiding
spot to hide things from teachers.

1076
01:02:16.069 --> 01:02:19.788
- They did that a lot. - You could hide
a whole box of cigarettes in there.

1077
01:02:19.874 --> 01:02:21.764
Yeah, a whole box of cigarettes.

1078
01:02:22.030 --> 01:02:23.229
I'm still a minor.

1079
01:02:23.538 --> 01:02:26.474
- Shouldn't you apologize to minors?
- Yes, apologize.

1080
01:02:26.499 --> 01:02:28.577
Of course, it is your preogative.

1081
01:02:28.897 --> 01:02:32.248
- He's a minor. - Ho-dong thinks this will
be edited out of our show, but it won't.

1082
01:02:32.327 --> 01:02:33.990
They're not going to edit this out.

1083
01:02:34.015 --> 01:02:37.646
We might protest and not come
to work next week. Apologize.

1084
01:02:37.671 --> 01:02:39.091
I won't stand for this either.

1085
01:02:39.116 --> 01:02:41.623
My gosh, they're all crazy.

1086
01:02:44.213 --> 01:02:47.229
(Smoking is harmful to your health)

1087
01:02:48.304 --> 01:02:50.006
I'll ask my last question.

1088
01:02:50.436 --> 01:02:53.756
What do you think makes me
the happiest these days?

1089
01:02:53.796 --> 01:02:55.202
It might be philosophical.

1090
01:02:55.257 --> 01:02:57.491
(Right at this moment!)

1091
01:02:59.265 --> 01:03:01.123
I wonder what it is.

1092
01:03:03.038 --> 01:03:04.616
This is the moment.

1093
01:03:04.678 --> 01:03:07.257
When you go to school
these days, you're really...

1094
01:03:07.282 --> 01:03:10.843
popular and your friends
gather around you.

1095
01:03:10.868 --> 01:03:14.639
- They gather around you. - They
gather around and ask for autographs.

1096
01:03:14.663 --> 01:03:19.459
They come around you all the time
and ask to hang out with as well.

1097
01:03:19.819 --> 01:03:21.811
- He's like a celebrity.
- Nope.

1098
01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:25.225
I like being a regular kid at school.

1099
01:03:25.593 --> 01:03:29.530
- You don't want them to see you as a
model? - No, just a plain student.

1100
01:03:29.890 --> 01:03:32.763
My happiness does have a
lot to do with my friends.

1101
01:03:32.788 --> 01:03:34.272
You travel a lot.

1102
01:03:34.421 --> 01:03:37.232
You travel to different countries
because of your fashion shows.

1103
01:03:37.257 --> 01:03:38.694
- That's my happiness?
- Yeah.

1104
01:03:38.921 --> 01:03:40.310
- It's possible.
- World experience.

1105
01:03:40.335 --> 01:03:43.748
- My friends aren't at the fashion show.
- Friends abroad?

1106
01:03:43.979 --> 01:03:45.307
Don't you have friends abroad?

1107
01:03:45.332 --> 01:03:50.850
- We all know that Times picked him as
the 30 most influential teens. - Yes.

1108
01:03:50.874 --> 01:03:53.389
That's all in the adult's perspective.

1109
01:03:53.554 --> 01:03:56.256
We have to see it in the
student's perspective.

1110
01:03:56.796 --> 01:03:59.526
If I think back to when
I was in high school...

1111
01:03:59.551 --> 01:04:03.631
we loved going to the places
like the Cola-tech or Disco-tech.

1112
01:04:04.405 --> 01:04:08.905
I felt like I owned the world when I'd
go with my friends after working out.

1113
01:04:09.311 --> 01:04:11.052
Especially when the music was blasting.

1114
01:04:11.077 --> 01:04:14.429
Burp sounds were louder than
the music at Cola-techs.

1115
01:04:15.882 --> 01:04:19.699
Hyun-min! Your happiness is when
you go to school every day...

1116
01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:25.295
and your desk is full of presents
and letters from female students.

1117
01:04:25.804 --> 01:04:29.452
- I'm sorry, my school isn't co-ed.
- I got it! I'm totally sure of it!

1118
01:04:29.842 --> 01:04:32.328
Hyun-min makes an earning these days.

1119
01:04:32.655 --> 01:04:35.373
Therefore, he has a lot
more allowance than before.

1120
01:04:35.491 --> 01:04:38.054
You buy deokbboki for your friends.

1121
01:04:38.079 --> 01:04:43.069
You're happy because you can buy
all the snacks your friends want.

1122
01:04:43.749 --> 01:04:47.498
- Wrong. - When you win your friends
during a game at a PC room.

1123
01:04:47.936 --> 01:04:51.780
No. I agree with Jang-hoon when he said
Hyun-min can buy things for his friends.

1124
01:04:52.155 --> 01:04:54.366
He can pay for his friend's
time at the PC room as well!

1125
01:04:54.421 --> 01:04:57.373
No. Doing this is just happiness in itself.

1126
01:04:57.921 --> 01:05:00.928
I got it! Let's say you
just got off of runway.

1127
01:05:01.241 --> 01:05:03.825
When you eat ramen while
playing at a PC room.

1128
01:05:03.851 --> 01:05:06.363
- This is...
- When you eat ramen and play games...

1129
01:05:06.403 --> 01:05:09.231
with your friends at a PC room!

1130
01:05:09.256 --> 01:05:11.663
Wow! That's exactly right! You got it.

1131
01:05:12.554 --> 01:05:13.655
How cute!

1132
01:05:14.061 --> 01:05:16.343
- I almost got it right.
- Didn't I say that?

1133
01:05:16.538 --> 01:05:19.045
- What was the difference?
- It was after he got off work.

1134
01:05:19.186 --> 01:05:21.934
- It was after I got off work.
- I see, after work. - Not after school.

1135
01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:27.342
For us, we get off work and our
day ends with a shot of soju.

1136
01:05:27.741 --> 01:05:31.780
- For him, it's playing at a PC room.
- Don't you need to study?

1137
01:05:32.585 --> 01:05:37.113
I decided to break-up with studying
when I was in elementary school.

1138
01:05:39.619 --> 01:05:42.005
Is that when you use the word "break-up"?

1139
01:05:42.030 --> 01:05:46.663
- That's when you use that word.
- I go to PC rooms to relieve my stress.

1140
01:05:46.968 --> 01:05:49.959
The location of the PC
rooms matter as well.

1141
01:05:50.679 --> 01:05:54.394
I go to a PC room in Hongdae if I
have a photo shoot in Euljiro.

1142
01:05:54.472 --> 01:05:57.855
The PC room in Hongdae is
known for their egg and rice.

1143
01:05:58.093 --> 01:05:59.926
I always eat eggs and rice there.

1144
01:06:00.101 --> 01:06:02.990
If I have a shoot in Kangnam
or somewhere close...

1145
01:06:03.015 --> 01:06:06.717
I'll go to a PC room in Itaewon
since they make the best ramen.

1146
01:06:07.304 --> 01:06:10.084
- I'll eat ramen and...
- Not cup ramen? - No.

1147
01:06:10.108 --> 01:06:12.639
They make the ramen for you these days.

1148
01:06:13.030 --> 01:06:16.163
It's delicious. Aluminum foil?
They don't use that anymore.

1149
01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:18.966
- Aluminum foil ramen was good, wasn't it?
- It's even better.

1150
01:06:18.991 --> 01:06:21.919
- That's crazy.
- They perfectly make each role.

1151
01:06:21.944 --> 01:06:26.623
When I'm eating a ramen and playing
games at a PC room, it's like you said.

1152
01:06:27.030 --> 01:06:30.631
It's the same as you guys having
drink and I'm playing games.

1153
01:06:30.976 --> 01:06:33.592
What stresses you out, Hyun-min?

1154
01:06:33.741 --> 01:06:37.342
Well, it's when I want to
hangout with my friends.

1155
01:06:37.655 --> 01:06:41.919
We're in high school, so my friends are
either working part-time or studying.

1156
01:06:41.944 --> 01:06:45.442
That's why I think playing games
has become sort of like my friend.

1157
01:06:45.468 --> 01:06:48.216
- Are you good at soccer?
- I'm good at kicking the ball.

1158
01:06:48.241 --> 01:06:50.716
You do? You should come over next time.

1159
01:06:50.741 --> 01:06:54.480
I saw your phantom dribbling
on "One Night and Two Days".

1160
01:06:55.210 --> 01:06:59.097
Are you interested in those things as well?
You should only play soccer.

1161
01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:03.030
(Great advice from one
soccer-lover to another)

1162
01:07:03.715 --> 01:07:07.514
(A place with romance
when you're in school)

1163
01:07:08.434 --> 01:07:14.135
(Welcome to "Ask Us Anything's"
school broadcast room)

1164
01:07:15.077 --> 01:07:19.536
- Is this the place? - I think this is "Ask
Us Anything" High School Broadcasting room.

1165
01:07:19.561 --> 01:07:23.803
- I think this is the broadcasting room.
- Really? - Let's sit over here.

1166
01:07:24.663 --> 01:07:27.607
- I'm getting nervous.
- Do you go in there?

1167
01:07:27.632 --> 01:07:29.584
Why are you guys here again?

1168
01:07:29.663 --> 01:07:32.061
This must be the broadcasting room.

1169
01:07:32.374 --> 01:07:35.170
They always follow me around.
Why are you here?

1170
01:07:35.616 --> 01:07:38.444
- Aren't you a wrestler?
- The basketball player?

1171
01:07:38.499 --> 01:07:39.960
You're my senior.

1172
01:07:40.233 --> 01:07:42.817
Why are you here when you're
in the wrestling club?

1173
01:07:42.843 --> 01:07:45.764
- This is the broadcasting room.
- The wrestling room isn't here.

1174
01:07:45.858 --> 01:07:48.741
- You should go to the acting club.
- Why?

1175
01:07:48.843 --> 01:07:51.146
You belong in the acting club, not here.

1176
01:07:51.171 --> 01:07:52.888
You don't know about my dreams.

1177
01:07:52.913 --> 01:07:57.342
- Aren't you a food fighter?
- They upset because Lee Soo-il is missing.

1178
01:07:58.069 --> 01:08:00.139
Yeah, you should go there.

1179
01:08:00.718 --> 01:08:04.303
- Go try and act like Lee Soo-il.
- They have a taxi waiting for you.

1180
01:08:04.499 --> 01:08:06.990
Reporting the news is
also considered acting.

1181
01:08:07.015 --> 01:08:09.584
- Our seniors are coming in.
- Hello.

1182
01:08:09.976 --> 01:08:11.763
- Hello.
- Why is it so loud in here?

1183
01:08:11.788 --> 01:08:13.913
- Go ahead and sit down.
- Hello.

1184
01:08:14.030 --> 01:08:15.635
Sit down, sit down.

1185
01:08:15.897 --> 01:08:20.600
It's nice to meet you, I'm your idol! The
role model you've been dreaming about.

1186
01:08:21.155 --> 01:08:24.030
I'm the VP of the Broadcasting
Club, Jang Sung-kyu!

1187
01:08:24.147 --> 01:08:25.866
It's nice to meet you.

1188
01:08:26.069 --> 01:08:27.716
We've heard a lot about you.

1189
01:08:27.741 --> 01:08:31.630
I'm Lee Da-hee, the Broadcasting Club's
ace and goddess of the universe.

1190
01:08:31.655 --> 01:08:35.952
Lee Da-hee! Lee Da-hee! Lee Da-hee!

1191
01:08:36.210 --> 01:08:40.099
I'm the eldest in the Broadcasting Club.
You don't need to know my name.

1192
01:08:40.124 --> 01:08:42.022
Why not?

1193
01:08:42.749 --> 01:08:46.061
- Shouldn't we know your name?
- I don't think you need to know my name.

1194
01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:47.693
You should still tell us.

1195
01:08:47.718 --> 01:08:51.217
That's the senior that sold all the
Broadcasting Club's equipment.

1196
01:08:51.405 --> 01:08:53.318
- He sold it to pay back his debt.
- He sold everything.

1197
01:08:53.343 --> 01:08:56.366
He owed money to the PTA.

1198
01:08:56.858 --> 01:08:58.319
(All murmuring)

1199
01:08:58.794 --> 01:09:00.741
I heard he owed a lot
of money to the snack bar.

1200
01:09:00.766 --> 01:09:02.419
That's why he can't graduate.

1201
01:09:02.444 --> 01:09:05.038
- Is that for real?
- Yeah, it's for real.

1202
01:09:05.063 --> 01:09:09.069
We had to slap each other's hand
for our relay races last year.

1203
01:09:09.288 --> 01:09:12.221
He even sold off the
athletic program's batons.

1204
01:09:12.593 --> 01:09:14.709
He sold all the school's equipment.

1205
01:09:14.780 --> 01:09:18.225
Do you know who our
Broadcasting Club's teacher is?

1206
01:09:18.616 --> 01:09:21.030
- Who?
- It's Sohn Suk-hee!

1207
01:09:21.929 --> 01:09:23.366
That's right, sit properly!

1208
01:09:23.429 --> 01:09:27.413
Our teacher wants to pick the best new
person for our "Ask Us Anything"...

1209
01:09:27.491 --> 01:09:30.826
High School's Broadcasting
Club while keeping...

1210
01:09:30.851 --> 01:09:33.968
our traditions and
representing our future.

1211
01:09:34.061 --> 01:09:37.317
The three of us are here, so we can
choose one person amongst you guys.

1212
01:09:37.343 --> 01:09:40.366
Listen carefully and show us
all your talents. Alright?

1213
01:09:40.444 --> 01:09:41.444
Yes, we understand.

1214
01:09:41.515 --> 01:09:44.053
- Sit down.
- Sit in the middle, Da-hee.

1215
01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:46.857
Be careful. Sang-min is irritable today.

1216
01:09:46.882 --> 01:09:48.170
His name is Sang-min?

1217
01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:50.877
- He didn't tell us his name.
- I just told you.

1218
01:09:51.624 --> 01:09:55.081
His name is Sang-min? I'm
honored to know his name.

1219
01:09:55.218 --> 01:09:58.248
To be honest, I didn't really
care to know his name.

1220
01:09:58.272 --> 01:10:00.428
- We should know his name.
- Alright!

1221
01:10:00.655 --> 01:10:02.436
Doesn't he look sad today?

1222
01:10:02.804 --> 01:10:05.060
You guys gave me your
statements for entrance.

1223
01:10:05.085 --> 01:10:07.280
I'll try to match you to your statement.

1224
01:10:08.296 --> 01:10:10.674
- Who is Kang Ho-dong?
- Yes?

1225
01:10:12.147 --> 01:10:14.932
(The first contestant is Ho-dong)

1226
01:10:16.038 --> 01:10:17.643
You're disqualified.

1227
01:10:19.483 --> 01:10:22.530
- Can we know the reason?
- You didn't tell us why.

1228
01:10:22.905 --> 01:10:23.905
Why?

1229
01:10:23.944 --> 01:10:25.842
I'm uncomfortable around you.

1230
01:10:26.015 --> 01:10:28.123
What am I lacking?

1231
01:10:28.851 --> 01:10:30.756
Have you seen how passionate I am?

1232
01:10:30.780 --> 01:10:32.334
Have you seen my will?

1233
01:10:32.382 --> 01:10:34.545
I actually like your spirit.

1234
01:10:34.561 --> 01:10:39.905
What I hear is that you're potentially
a rising star in wrestling.

1235
01:10:40.093 --> 01:10:41.748
Why are you at this club?

1236
01:10:41.772 --> 01:10:43.791
I predict that I'll be
wrestling champion...

1237
01:10:43.816 --> 01:10:45.834
5 times and Baekdu Wrestling
Champion 7-times.

1238
01:10:45.936 --> 01:10:51.022
About the age of 25, I'll retire wrestling
and start a career as an entertainer.

1239
01:10:51.429 --> 01:10:53.896
It's not coming quickly to me.

1240
01:10:53.921 --> 01:10:57.678
I bet you'll also have a period when
you can't come on TV for a while.

1241
01:10:58.366 --> 01:11:00.155
I'll do my best.

1242
01:11:01.616 --> 01:11:04.661
You should apologize in
advance for what you'll do.

1243
01:11:04.686 --> 01:11:06.163
Go ahead, apologize.

1244
01:11:06.429 --> 01:11:08.686
Wait, Ho-dong. I have a question.

1245
01:11:09.530 --> 01:11:11.920
Since you'll be an
entertainer in the future...

1246
01:11:11.945 --> 01:11:14.974
what do you think is the
trend in variety shows?

1247
01:11:14.999 --> 01:11:18.865
Will it be "Kang's Kitchen", "Let's Have
Dinner Together" or "Ask Us Anything"?

1248
01:11:18.890 --> 01:11:21.435
- I believe it's "Ask Us Anything".
- Why?

1249
01:11:21.460 --> 01:11:22.607
- What?
- Why?

1250
01:11:22.632 --> 01:11:26.764
I believe the trend is being carefree.
Moving freely like the water.

1251
01:11:27.163 --> 01:11:28.716
It's not artificial either.

1252
01:11:28.741 --> 01:11:30.388
It's honest and clean.

1253
01:11:30.413 --> 01:11:33.630
It's also a program that
communicates with the audience.

1254
01:11:33.655 --> 01:11:37.651
- "Kang's Kitchen" and "Let's Eat Dinner
Together" doesn't have that? - No.

1255
01:11:37.936 --> 01:11:39.725
(Totally Honest)

1256
01:11:40.897 --> 01:11:43.221
(Even Da-hee accepts his passion)

1257
01:11:43.741 --> 01:11:45.873
- Great answer.
- Future variety!

1258
01:11:46.061 --> 01:11:47.600
Future broadcasting!

1259
01:11:47.952 --> 01:11:48.952
Swag!

1260
01:11:49.749 --> 01:11:51.065
Let's get it.

1261
01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:53.224
Do you think you'll be okay?

1262
01:11:53.249 --> 01:11:54.958
Are you going to be okay?

1263
01:11:54.983 --> 01:11:57.080
No, absolutely not. No worries.

1264
01:11:57.421 --> 01:11:59.877
No worries. He even speaks English.

1265
01:12:00.851 --> 01:12:03.526
If you were born again...

1266
01:12:03.551 --> 01:12:06.523
would you be a wrestling
star or a great entertainer...

1267
01:12:06.548 --> 01:12:08.913
who is always nominated
for the grand prize?

1268
01:12:09.694 --> 01:12:12.092
You can only choose one or the either.

1269
01:12:13.796 --> 01:12:16.541
Tell her you want to be
a 'wrestling clown'.

1270
01:12:17.944 --> 01:12:21.229
(A person that wrestles and
is a clown on television)

1271
01:12:23.241 --> 01:12:25.596
I can't believe you guys didn't know.

1272
01:12:25.827 --> 01:12:29.159
- He told you to be both.
- Wrestling and broadcasting?

1273
01:12:29.455 --> 01:12:32.759
Yes, I'd like to be loved by
everyone in each community.

1274
01:12:32.784 --> 01:12:35.268
A 'wrestling clown' that can
do both for each industry.

1275
01:12:35.293 --> 01:12:39.018
He'll be a bird that flies between
wrestling and broadcasting.

1276
01:12:39.608 --> 01:12:42.498
He'll be a new kind of entertainer.

1277
01:12:42.616 --> 01:12:44.155
A 'wrestling clown'.

1278
01:12:44.515 --> 01:12:48.202
It's Kang Ho-dong representing
Korea as the 'wrestling clown'!

1279
01:12:49.233 --> 01:12:51.327
Sit down, wrestling clown!

1280
01:12:52.584 --> 01:12:54.773
(Everyone complimented
his name as 'wrestling clown.

1281
01:12:54.798 --> 01:12:57.200
A person who shot
two birds with one stone)

1282
01:12:57.226 --> 01:12:58.541
(Respect)

1283
01:12:59.595 --> 01:13:01.123
(I respect you)

1284
01:13:01.632 --> 01:13:03.998
Can you stay after school today?

1285
01:13:04.265 --> 01:13:06.823
(Yes, please teach me your ways)

1286
01:13:07.147 --> 01:13:08.881
Next, it's Yeong-cheol.

1287
01:13:09.077 --> 01:13:13.044
I'm Kim Yeong-cheol and I'll be leading the
broadcasting club in the next generation.

1288
01:13:13.069 --> 01:13:17.435
Currently, I'm broadcasting a personal
radio show from 7-9 in the morning.

1289
01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:19.552
Have you ever heard my show?

1290
01:13:19.577 --> 01:13:25.530
My show was ranked third when they recently
did a listener-rating on all radio shows.

1291
01:13:26.733 --> 01:13:28.069
Respect!

1292
01:13:28.265 --> 01:13:31.224
Yeong-cheol is the only one that
can win the 'wrestling clown'.

1293
01:13:31.249 --> 01:13:34.291
He does his own radio show in the morning.

1294
01:13:34.362 --> 01:13:36.295
(Does + Own + Radio = Dog)

1295
01:13:36.627 --> 01:13:39.397
What happens when the two of us meet?

1296
01:13:39.507 --> 01:13:42.530
- I'm a 'wrestling clown'.
- I'm a 'dog'.

1297
01:13:42.632 --> 01:13:45.272
That's 'wrestling clown' and 'dog'.

1298
01:13:45.374 --> 01:13:47.982
If he did the show damn
early, he'd be 'damned dog'.

1299
01:13:48.007 --> 01:13:49.834
Next, it's Min Kyung-hoon.

1300
01:13:49.929 --> 01:13:53.888
Please listen to why I should be
admitted to the Broadcasting Club.

1301
01:13:53.913 --> 01:13:57.764
First, you can see Da-hee
at the Broadcasting Club.

1302
01:13:58.374 --> 01:14:01.702
Second, I like Da-hee.

1303
01:14:02.186 --> 01:14:03.186
Third...

1304
01:14:04.155 --> 01:14:06.866
Da-hee and I will soon
be in a relationship.

1305
01:14:08.015 --> 01:14:10.049
Today's our first day together.

1306
01:14:10.655 --> 01:14:12.756
I think she's going to hug me.

1307
01:14:13.483 --> 01:14:15.452
I actually have something to give you.

1308
01:14:15.616 --> 01:14:17.967
You already have a couple ring for us?

1309
01:14:20.022 --> 01:14:22.474
Give him the rest in your other pocket.

1310
01:14:22.499 --> 01:14:25.295
- In my other pocket? - Do you
really have a couple ring in there?

1311
01:14:25.413 --> 01:14:27.389
We need to hear it.

1312
01:14:30.062 --> 01:14:31.580
(Damn it!)

1313
01:14:32.624 --> 01:14:35.905
I'm not letting anyone
broadcast anything today!

1314
01:14:36.101 --> 01:14:38.772
Put it down, I told you to put it down!

1315
01:14:39.343 --> 01:14:42.920
why isn't Jo Su-ae and
Kim Ji-young here yet?

1316
01:14:44.311 --> 01:14:47.569
- Kim Ji-young is an actress!
- She played Bok-Gil!

1317
01:14:48.194 --> 01:14:50.983
(I'm really sorry, Announcer Kim Ji-young)

1318
01:14:51.593 --> 01:14:55.178
Be quiet, everyone. I have
something to ask you, Kyung-hoon.

1319
01:14:55.257 --> 01:14:58.233
What if you had to be on a show...

1320
01:14:58.358 --> 01:15:01.935
but your girlfriend kept asking
you to stay with her instead?

1321
01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:03.100
What would you do?

1322
01:15:03.140 --> 01:15:05.373
I would stay with my girlfriend.

1323
01:15:06.319 --> 01:15:08.748
I'd start a live simultaneous broadcast.

1324
01:15:11.007 --> 01:15:13.717
- How? - I'd start a live
broadcast with my girlfriend...

1325
01:15:13.742 --> 01:15:17.224
and keep filming our day, so I
don't flake out on my show.

1326
01:15:17.249 --> 01:15:21.342
I'd continue to do everything in
powers to tackle both jobs properly.

1327
01:15:21.655 --> 01:15:23.857
He has enough talent not
to make an ass of himself.

1328
01:15:23.882 --> 01:15:27.295
That's why they call him 'live ass'.
It's hard being a 'live ass'.

1329
01:15:27.655 --> 01:15:29.631
Check out 'live ass'.

1330
01:15:31.514 --> 01:15:35.443
Did you say, "Live" or "Divorce"? I heard
live divorce simultaneous broadcast.

1331
01:15:35.468 --> 01:15:37.569
A live divorce simultaneous broadcast?

1332
01:15:37.848 --> 01:15:40.974
- A live divorce simultaneous broadcast?
- A live divorce simultaneous broadcast?

1333
01:15:40.999 --> 01:15:43.762
It's possible for a live divorce
simultaneous broadcast?

1334
01:15:43.968 --> 01:15:45.663
I'm sorry, guys.

1335
01:15:46.085 --> 01:15:48.522
Hey, guys! Can you listen to me?

1336
01:15:48.905 --> 01:15:54.639
I'm fine with you guys talking about that,
but could you look over there as well?

1337
01:15:55.296 --> 01:15:56.888
Why do you only look at me?

1338
01:15:56.913 --> 01:15:59.782
Jang-hoon can be in charge
of live broadcasts.

1339
01:16:00.093 --> 01:16:02.426
You guys should look at him as well.

1340
01:16:02.593 --> 01:16:05.391
Doesn't something smell
fishy over there, too?

1341
01:16:06.061 --> 01:16:09.813
Have you ever sent a sign to your
girlfriend while on a show before?

1342
01:16:09.991 --> 01:16:13.288
I've never done that before.
I'm not an amateur.

1343
01:16:14.132 --> 01:16:17.024
This 'damn ass' doesn't
do things like that.

1344
01:16:17.499 --> 01:16:18.969
I hope you trust me.

1345
01:16:19.608 --> 01:16:20.876
- Really?
- Yes.

1346
01:16:21.202 --> 01:16:24.069
Wow, I really like that. I'm impressed.

1347
01:16:24.515 --> 01:16:26.508
Next, let's hear from Hee-chul.

1348
01:16:26.796 --> 01:16:29.563
- I'm looking forward to this.
- He's handsome.

1349
01:16:29.632 --> 01:16:30.632
He's pretty.

1350
01:16:30.811 --> 01:16:33.248
Hello, my name is Kim Hee-chul.

1351
01:16:33.952 --> 01:16:39.241
The reason I applied for the Broadcasting
Club is because Da-hee is here.

1352
01:16:40.046 --> 01:16:41.998
Did you fall for me too?

1353
01:16:42.710 --> 01:16:44.842
My looks are accepted here.

1354
01:16:45.319 --> 01:16:48.561
I satisfy all the needs of
being pretty in this club.

1355
01:16:48.976 --> 01:16:52.092
I know you're pretty, but
you're not all that.

1356
01:16:52.476 --> 01:16:54.639
Imagine if I had hair as long as you.

1357
01:16:55.054 --> 01:16:56.430
I'm pretty too.

1358
01:16:56.726 --> 01:17:00.241
- Let's see? - Do I really
have to compare myself to you?

1359
01:17:00.999 --> 01:17:03.670
Wait a second! My feelings
are getting hurt too!

1360
01:17:04.093 --> 01:17:05.732
Okay. Kim Hee-chul wins.

1361
01:17:05.757 --> 01:17:07.110
(Shocked)

1362
01:17:08.819 --> 01:17:10.709
No, Da-hee is prettier.

1363
01:17:11.132 --> 01:17:13.522
You are pretty, but you still lose, Da-hee.

1364
01:17:13.843 --> 01:17:16.623
I'll only have eyes for you, Da-hee.

1365
01:17:17.874 --> 01:17:22.465
- Do you want what's in my other pocket?
- I'll take it when no one is watching.

1366
01:17:23.476 --> 01:17:25.217
Now, it's Soo-geun's turn.

1367
01:17:25.343 --> 01:17:26.719
I've been ready to be a reporter.

1368
01:17:26.744 --> 01:17:30.788
I've been hosting singing contests and
village broadcast for a long time...

1369
01:17:31.007 --> 01:17:34.084
in my home village, Jueup-ri,
Gaegun-myeon, Yangpyeong-gun, Gyeonggi-do

1370
01:17:35.843 --> 01:17:39.998
Ah, ah! Misters, we're trying to test...
Test the Tetris game.

1371
01:17:40.468 --> 01:17:42.657
(Jueup-ri's pro-gamer)

1372
01:17:43.990 --> 01:17:46.724
(The competitors burst out laughing
from his unexpected comments)

1373
01:17:46.749 --> 01:17:48.985
Ah, ah! I bet you want an Americano.

1374
01:17:49.374 --> 01:17:52.850
We're planning to have
a jajangmyeon party...

1375
01:17:53.077 --> 01:17:55.217
with all the folks from our village...

1376
01:17:55.476 --> 01:17:57.522
at the village community center.

1377
01:17:57.772 --> 01:18:01.100
Please come to the community center
by 6, and please don't be late!

1378
01:18:01.179 --> 01:18:04.123
I almost forgot! Only our men
members are welcome tonight.

1379
01:18:04.194 --> 01:18:06.817
I think it'll be okay if the
female members don't attend.

1380
01:18:06.843 --> 01:18:09.928
(Mom said she didn't like jajangmyeon)

1381
01:18:10.918 --> 01:18:12.426
(Laughing)

1382
01:18:13.599 --> 01:18:15.889
I was born ready to be a reporter.

1383
01:18:17.514 --> 01:18:19.600
Yes, I was born ready.

1384
01:18:19.827 --> 01:18:22.967
I'm confident I'll be chosen,
if I can win those two people.

1385
01:18:23.085 --> 01:18:27.202
No matter how much I think about
it, it'll be hard to beat...

1386
01:18:27.679 --> 01:18:29.779
a person that can wrestle
and be an entertainer.

1387
01:18:29.804 --> 01:18:32.959
He's the future of
professional entertainers.

1388
01:18:33.022 --> 01:18:36.168
The future of broadcasting,
'wrestling clown'.

1389
01:18:36.944 --> 01:18:39.950
(I'll do my best to wrestle
as well as be entertaining)

1390
01:18:40.304 --> 01:18:44.028
My other competitor is 'live ass' since
he is entertaining on live television.

1391
01:18:44.053 --> 01:18:47.475
My goodness, I almost forgot this person!

1392
01:18:48.233 --> 01:18:51.067
When a couple is going
through hard-times...

1393
01:18:51.397 --> 01:18:54.825
our live divorce simultaneous
broadcasting reporter.

1394
01:18:55.124 --> 01:18:58.192
No! It's against school
rules to use violence!

1395
01:18:58.968 --> 01:19:00.326
You have to be understanding.

1396
01:19:00.351 --> 01:19:03.043
Yes, our school doesn't
use any kind of violence.

1397
01:19:03.296 --> 01:19:06.584
(I'm not going to let you get
away with this, Lee Soo-geun)

1398
01:19:06.608 --> 01:19:11.873
I believe having competitors is great
since it helps me be a better person.

1399
01:19:12.374 --> 01:19:15.428
I really like you, Soo-geun. I
still have a question for you.

1400
01:19:15.453 --> 01:19:16.453
Yes, go ahead.

1401
01:19:16.718 --> 01:19:20.553
It seems like you're
especially afraid of Ho-dong.

1402
01:19:21.022 --> 01:19:23.499
Let's say, you need to do a show.

1403
01:19:23.524 --> 01:19:28.873
Suddenly, Ho-dong tells you to come to him
or he'll kill you. What would you do?

1404
01:19:29.030 --> 01:19:31.356
First, I'll go to Ho-dong and come back.

1405
01:19:31.718 --> 01:19:34.563
He always stops before the brinks of death.

1406
01:19:34.890 --> 01:19:37.467
He still allows me to
limp all the way home.

1407
01:19:37.741 --> 01:19:39.459
- You're not scared of Ho-dong?
- What?

1408
01:19:39.561 --> 01:19:41.036
- You're not scared of him?
- Absolutely not.

1409
01:19:41.061 --> 01:19:43.366
Then, go and flick his forehead.

1410
01:19:43.936 --> 01:19:46.092
I believe that's wrong of you.

1411
01:19:46.241 --> 01:19:49.163
I don't think it's right for
one person to ask their...

1412
01:19:49.188 --> 01:19:51.974
junior classmate to use
violence on another person.

1413
01:19:51.999 --> 01:19:55.344
How long has it been that you
couldn't close your legs?

1414
01:19:56.561 --> 01:19:58.436
- Soo-geun!
- Yes?

1415
01:19:58.671 --> 01:20:01.047
You still need to do it since
senior classmate asked you.

1416
01:20:01.079 --> 01:20:04.391
Flick Ho-dong's forehead so
hard, we can hear it from here.

1417
01:20:04.616 --> 01:20:07.694
You're coming this way?
Why are you coming here?

1418
01:20:08.257 --> 01:20:09.257
Show us!

1419
01:20:09.569 --> 01:20:11.341
- She told me to do it.
- Go away.

1420
01:20:11.366 --> 01:20:12.529
Who should I hit over there?

1421
01:20:12.554 --> 01:20:14.154
- What?
- Who should I hit over there/

1422
01:20:14.179 --> 01:20:15.891
The fat kid on the left.

1423
01:20:17.952 --> 01:20:20.133
Soo-geun! You shouldn't do that.

1424
01:20:20.265 --> 01:20:22.506
- You need this gig.
- You should listen to our seniors.

1425
01:20:22.647 --> 01:20:24.989
You need to make the right choice!

1426
01:20:25.210 --> 01:20:27.147
Go back to the 'wrestling clown'!

1427
01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:29.868
Alright! I've made a decision!

1428
01:20:31.054 --> 01:20:35.514
I'm sure there will be a price to
pay if I flick Ho-dong's forehead.

1429
01:20:35.835 --> 01:20:39.709
Isn't it better to choose this side,
when I won't see the seniors anymore?

1430
01:20:40.030 --> 01:20:42.305
(He really was born to be on television)

1431
01:20:42.566 --> 01:20:44.748
- He's so funny.
- Good job!

1432
01:20:45.358 --> 01:20:47.967
Thank you, seniors! I'll do my best!

1433
01:20:48.257 --> 01:20:50.235
I'm good at running errands as well!

1434
01:20:50.444 --> 01:20:53.139
Darn! It's live divorce
simultaneous reporter's turn.

1435
01:20:53.429 --> 01:20:55.295
He's the front-runner.

1436
01:20:56.843 --> 01:20:58.036
Next, Jang-hoon.

1437
01:20:58.249 --> 01:21:01.451
I'm the best-looking and I'm the only son
of this school's foundation president.

1438
01:21:01.476 --> 01:21:04.584
My name is Seo Jang-hoon and
I used to play basketball.

1439
01:21:04.608 --> 01:21:09.288
I'd like to quit playing basketball
and join the Broadcasting Club.

1440
01:21:09.647 --> 01:21:13.395
- Shouldn't you be smart and have facts
if you're part of this club? - Of course.

1441
01:21:13.421 --> 01:21:17.217
I'm the only one who is smart
and has common sense.

1442
01:21:17.460 --> 01:21:19.169
Shall we sign our contract?

1443
01:21:19.194 --> 01:21:21.709
Who care if you're smart
and have common sense?

1444
01:21:21.819 --> 01:21:24.302
There's no happiness in your life!

1445
01:21:24.327 --> 01:21:28.811
How can you deliver happiness to the
audience, when you're not happy?

1446
01:21:29.296 --> 01:21:34.069
The only way to deliver happiness
is by being happy yourself.

1447
01:21:34.593 --> 01:21:37.491
You should find happiness first!

1448
01:21:37.577 --> 01:21:39.966
Do you currently have
happiness in your life?

1449
01:21:39.991 --> 01:21:41.599
What do you think about that?

1450
01:21:41.624 --> 01:21:43.897
- Jang-hoon!
- Let's be happy.

1451
01:21:45.632 --> 01:21:47.678
(Let's be happy)

1452
01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:49.896
I like that kind of determination.

1453
01:21:49.921 --> 01:21:52.521
- Let me ask a question, Jang-hoon.
- Okay.

1454
01:21:52.546 --> 01:21:58.280
When was the last time you felt
like you were the happiest?

1455
01:21:58.305 --> 01:21:59.880
Except for when you received your award.

1456
01:21:59.905 --> 01:22:02.670
The moment I met you.

1457
01:22:03.983 --> 01:22:05.998
What do you think about
what he said, Da-hee?

1458
01:22:06.030 --> 01:22:07.850
I'm getting jealous!

1459
01:22:08.272 --> 01:22:10.974
You should give him a hand-written letter.

1460
01:22:10.999 --> 01:22:13.465
I'll decline the hand-written letter.

1461
01:22:13.983 --> 01:22:17.366
Recently, I was slapped many
times by another woman.

1462
01:22:18.436 --> 01:22:21.280
Her hair looked like a poodle's hair.

1463
01:22:22.399 --> 01:22:24.547
You must've gotten hit a lot.

1464
01:22:24.663 --> 01:22:29.184
- I'll decline hand-written letters from
now on. - Good. Come on up, Hyun-min.

1465
01:22:30.272 --> 01:22:34.012
- Physical!
- He has the best first impression.

1466
01:22:34.999 --> 01:22:39.141
Hello, my name is Han Hyun-min and
I'm a rising broadcasting star.

1467
01:22:39.343 --> 01:22:43.334
Don't you think our club will become
hot if someone hot like me joins?

1468
01:22:43.811 --> 01:22:48.247
Would you be okay with not being able to
enter PC rooms if you join this club?

1469
01:22:49.452 --> 01:22:52.239
- PC rooms.
- He's really contemplating this.

1470
01:22:52.718 --> 01:22:56.693
- This is real for him.
- You need to get into the club, Hyun-min.

1471
01:22:56.718 --> 01:22:59.061
From what I hear, I hear...

1472
01:22:59.913 --> 01:23:02.663
Hyun-min has a lower IQ than Kyung-hoon.

1473
01:23:02.710 --> 01:23:03.710
- Eba!
- Eba?

1474
01:23:04.288 --> 01:23:06.521
What is 'eba'? How can
a reporter use slang?

1475
01:23:06.546 --> 01:23:07.943
What does 'eba' mean?

1476
01:23:07.968 --> 01:23:10.233
It means you're going over-board.

1477
01:23:10.944 --> 01:23:13.030
You shouldn't use slang like, eba!

1478
01:23:13.124 --> 01:23:14.336
Are you smart?

1479
01:23:14.538 --> 01:23:18.551
- Of course. - I'll ask you a
question since you said you're smart.

1480
01:23:18.757 --> 01:23:20.709
There's a river in Hungary.

1481
01:23:21.382 --> 01:23:23.318
Is it named the Denube or Danube River?

1482
01:23:23.343 --> 01:23:25.123
It's Tumen River.

1483
01:23:25.233 --> 01:23:27.129
(Standing ovation)

1484
01:23:28.593 --> 01:23:30.118
Wow! Fantastic!

1485
01:23:30.655 --> 01:23:33.091
That's great! I liked your answer.

1486
01:23:33.116 --> 01:23:37.055
- That was a good answer, Hyun-min.
- That was a sinker.

1487
01:23:37.936 --> 01:23:40.586
So far, I think you'll
be the best reporter.

1488
01:23:40.702 --> 01:23:42.413
Go back to your seat, Hyun-min.

1489
01:23:42.561 --> 01:23:44.926
Thank you for your introductions.

1490
01:23:45.186 --> 01:23:49.733
From this point on, we're going
to test you to see whether...

1491
01:23:50.147 --> 01:23:51.967
you belong to this club.

1492
01:23:52.101 --> 01:23:53.803
If you consider yourself a reporter...

1493
01:23:53.866 --> 01:23:57.288
you'll have to know all the news happening
at "Ask Us Anything" High School.

1494
01:23:57.343 --> 01:24:01.084
You need to simplify all the news
and report it in an orderly manner.

1495
01:24:01.108 --> 01:24:04.702
Before we do that, shouldn't
we see your talents?

1496
01:24:05.249 --> 01:24:07.428
- What about Da-hee?
- Da-hee and...

1497
01:24:07.630 --> 01:24:10.092
- Show us, Da-hee!
- You don't know about Da-hee, do you?

1498
01:24:10.117 --> 01:24:13.235
Da-hee is an excellent
reporter that stations like...

1499
01:24:13.260 --> 01:24:16.038
CNN and BBC are
trying to scout her.

1500
01:24:16.732 --> 01:24:18.630
Can you send them, Da-hee?

1501
01:24:18.655 --> 01:24:21.240
- Send what?
- What do you mean, "Send"?

1502
01:24:21.389 --> 01:24:23.677
Can you send something to BBC news?

1503
01:24:23.702 --> 01:24:25.911
Da-hee is going to show us later-on.

1504
01:24:25.936 --> 01:24:27.841
She has to show us, right now.

1505
01:24:27.866 --> 01:24:30.536
- You're their senior, so you can show
them how it's done. - Yeah, go ahead.

1506
01:24:30.561 --> 01:24:33.521
- Really?
- Professionals don't need to rehearse.

1507
01:24:33.546 --> 01:24:35.912
- They can go right away.
- Yeah, show them, Sung-kyu.

1508
01:24:35.928 --> 01:24:37.386
Launch, Da-hee.

1509
01:24:38.639 --> 01:24:41.873
How can a reporter use 'launch'
in this kind of sentence?

1510
01:24:41.975 --> 01:24:45.417
Show us how it's done, Sun-kyu.
In five, four, three...

1511
01:24:45.746 --> 01:24:48.777
- Let's go, Sun-kyu!
- We don't have enough time!

1512
01:24:49.803 --> 01:24:50.803
Cue!

1513
01:24:51.202 --> 01:24:54.136
This is "Ask Us Anything's"
new in one-minute.

1514
01:24:54.397 --> 01:24:58.146
"Ask Us Anything's" viewer's rating
is currently estimated at 5-6%.

1515
01:24:58.171 --> 01:25:00.373
They're cruising happily.

1516
01:25:00.686 --> 01:25:04.240
The most important thing
in all of this is, me.

1517
01:25:04.624 --> 01:25:06.802
It's because Jang Sun-kyu
was part of the show.

1518
01:25:06.827 --> 01:25:09.396
- Because of me...
- A bug has been implanted in your ear!

1519
01:25:09.420 --> 01:25:11.725
A bug has been implanted in your ear!

1520
01:25:12.076 --> 01:25:14.312
He's flustered! He's flustered.

1521
01:25:15.646 --> 01:25:19.717
I believe the show is successful
because I made a difference...

1522
01:25:19.959 --> 01:25:22.061
when IOI was on the show.

1523
01:25:22.202 --> 01:25:24.896
- Next week...
- Finished! - You're done.

1524
01:25:25.522 --> 01:25:28.880
You're not going to be on
the show from next week on?

1525
01:25:28.905 --> 01:25:31.999
- He didn't have a good ending.
- No, he didn't.

1526
01:25:33.491 --> 01:25:36.325
As you can see, it's even hard
for a professional to do.

1527
01:25:36.350 --> 01:25:39.976
I'll give you 5-minutes to get
ready for your 1-minute news.

1528
01:25:40.124 --> 01:25:41.419
We can't do it right away.

1529
01:25:41.444 --> 01:25:43.826
- One-minute news.
- "AUA" one-minute news.

1530
01:25:43.944 --> 01:25:45.302
We need to see an example.

1531
01:25:45.327 --> 01:25:47.482
Wow! Hyun-min is left-handed.

1532
01:25:47.592 --> 01:25:48.949
Being left-handed is
the trend these days.

1533
01:25:48.974 --> 01:25:51.341
- You're writing left-handed
because it's a trend?

1534
01:25:51.366 --> 01:25:54.999
- Can I talk trash about you?
- Of course. It'd be an honor.

1535
01:25:56.788 --> 01:25:59.959
Even bad press is still press.

1536
01:26:00.249 --> 01:26:03.847
- I suddenly don't want to do this.
- That's not right!

1537
01:26:05.756 --> 01:26:06.756
(Sudden regret)

1538
01:26:06.983 --> 01:26:11.744
I'm warning you, there may be disturbances
while you're reporting your news.

1539
01:26:12.178 --> 01:26:16.240
Remember to adjust accordingly
to those sudden situations.

1540
01:26:16.717 --> 01:26:18.811
- Stop!
- I didn't get to finish.

1541
01:26:19.100 --> 01:26:20.146
Put your pens down.

1542
01:26:20.349 --> 01:26:23.639
Da-hee put her pen down the first.

1543
01:26:24.936 --> 01:26:27.178
- Learn from her.
- Wow! Thank you.

1544
01:26:27.303 --> 01:26:30.075
- I'll show you how it's done.
- We're rooting for you, Da-hee.

1545
01:26:30.100 --> 01:26:33.802
- Pay attention when each person
is in there. - Okay! - Great!

1546
01:26:33.827 --> 01:26:36.380
- You don't need your headphones.
- I don't?

1547
01:26:36.405 --> 01:26:38.080
Reporters don't use headphones.

1548
01:26:38.342 --> 01:26:41.600
- You're not a DJ.
- Live 1-minute news.

1549
01:26:42.420 --> 01:26:44.934
This is Lee Da-hee for AUA 1-Minute News.

1550
01:26:44.959 --> 01:26:48.762
As you know, there are fixed students
that attend AUA High School.

1551
01:26:48.788 --> 01:26:53.912
Amongst the members, the least funny
student was recently kicked out of school.

1552
01:26:54.272 --> 01:26:58.521
None of the other students were upset
that Yeong-cheol was kicked out.

1553
01:26:58.936 --> 01:27:04.217
Lee Da-hee was chosen as the student,
who will replace Kim Yeong-cheol.

1554
01:27:04.444 --> 01:27:07.122
- She's promoting herself.
- We'll look forward to her presence.

1555
01:27:07.147 --> 01:27:09.739
I'm Lee Da-hee and that
was AUA's 1-minute news.

1556
01:27:09.764 --> 01:27:14.357
- There's still time. - I will sing you
a song since we have some time to kill.

1557
01:27:15.967 --> 01:27:17.568
That's great reaction.

1558
01:27:17.983 --> 01:27:20.682
(The thing about waiting is...)

1559
01:27:21.295 --> 01:27:24.783
(The ending song for
1-minute by Lee Da-hee)

1560
01:27:25.694 --> 01:27:26.694
(Laughing)

1561
01:27:30.479 --> 01:27:32.432
- That's the end!
- Thank you for listening.

1562
01:27:32.565 --> 01:27:35.505
She's a senior and she can't
get the timing correct?

1563
01:27:35.530 --> 01:27:37.990
You were great! You were wonderful!

1564
01:27:38.694 --> 01:27:42.020
- It's just as I thought!
- Just as I thought, Da-hee!

1565
01:27:42.045 --> 01:27:45.146
- Isn't that amazing?
- It's just like Da-hee.

1566
01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:47.795
The seniors approve of her.

1567
01:27:48.904 --> 01:27:50.926
You don't need to touch
anything these days.

1568
01:27:50.951 --> 01:27:53.411
He's thinking about
his days at clubs.

1569
01:27:53.436 --> 01:27:54.436
Test, test.

1570
01:27:55.038 --> 01:27:58.373
- Test. Burning night, sexy night!
- Good job.

1571
01:27:58.858 --> 01:27:59.858
Start.

1572
01:28:00.506 --> 01:28:03.100
We'll do our very best today as well.

1573
01:28:04.202 --> 01:28:05.598
We have eggs.

1574
01:28:09.272 --> 01:28:11.889
- Yeah, that's the same tone.
- Eggs for sale!

1575
01:28:12.334 --> 01:28:16.465
- Time is ticking. - This is news
about AUA's student, Kim Yeong-cheol.

1576
01:28:16.749 --> 01:28:21.016
Kim Yeong-cheol realized that comedy
wasn't the right genre for him and...

1577
01:28:21.319 --> 01:28:23.661
decided to only watch comedy from home.

1578
01:28:23.686 --> 01:28:25.974
He decided to look at
the big picture instead of...

1579
01:28:25.999 --> 01:28:28.725
of worrying about
the small things...

1580
01:28:29.030 --> 01:28:35.045
and succeeded in opening up a jam
business while selling various fruits.

1581
01:28:35.444 --> 01:28:37.381
He can't see things close to him.

1582
01:28:37.514 --> 01:28:40.396
The jam's brand name is "No Jam".

1583
01:28:42.358 --> 01:28:44.919
I have news about relationships.
Seo Jang-hoon...

1584
01:28:44.944 --> 01:28:48.849
almost had something going with Lee
Da-hee during a recording of AUA.

1585
01:28:48.874 --> 01:28:50.223
In the end...

1586
01:28:50.936 --> 01:28:55.139
- he couldn't fix his problems
and finally... - Cut!

1587
01:28:56.116 --> 01:28:58.037
In the end, what? What happened?

1588
01:28:58.155 --> 01:29:00.186
- I'm curious!
- What happened?

1589
01:29:01.194 --> 01:29:03.005
(Ho-dong's news ends with a cliff-hanger)

1590
01:29:03.030 --> 01:29:05.475
Hurry, tell us the rest of the news!

1591
01:29:05.811 --> 01:29:07.579
I told you, I'm curious!

1592
01:29:07.971 --> 01:29:11.766
(The two-people involved don't
even know what happened)

1593
01:29:11.827 --> 01:29:15.592
- I'm so curious as to what happened.
- Where did Ho-dong go?

1594
01:29:16.124 --> 01:29:19.998
Hurry, find out where he is. I
want to know what happened!

1595
01:29:21.475 --> 01:29:23.625
Let's continue with Yeong-cheol.

1596
01:29:24.233 --> 01:29:25.233
Start.

1597
01:29:25.764 --> 01:29:29.153
I have international news
for AUA's 1-minute news.

1598
01:29:29.178 --> 01:29:34.061
AUA's student, Kim Yeong-cheol attended a
world-wide competition for comedians...

1599
01:29:34.584 --> 01:29:37.903
and I have news that he placed
first in the competition.

1600
01:29:37.928 --> 01:29:42.842
All the students at AUA High School are
pleading Kim Yeong-cheol to return.

1601
01:29:43.319 --> 01:29:46.936
We're waiting for Kim Yeong-cheol's
return and his energy.

1602
01:29:47.186 --> 01:29:48.622
What's he talking about?

1603
01:29:48.647 --> 01:29:52.724
Let's watch Kim Yeong-cheol's skit at the
World Comedy Classic to end the show.

1604
01:29:52.749 --> 01:29:55.014
Which city sneezes the most at Sweden?

1605
01:29:55.233 --> 01:29:57.443
- Stockholm!
- Stop it!

1606
01:29:59.788 --> 01:30:03.053
- He was right on time!
- That's fabricated news.

1607
01:30:03.654 --> 01:30:06.139
It's personal dream news.

1608
01:30:06.491 --> 01:30:09.420
Three, two, one, start.

1609
01:30:10.124 --> 01:30:11.350
This is your 1-minute news.

1610
01:30:11.459 --> 01:30:14.653
Currently, the fine dust
pollution is at its highest.

1611
01:30:14.678 --> 01:30:17.678
The city's transportation
committee has decided to...

1612
01:30:17.803 --> 01:30:23.037
offer free public transportation to
people, who are trying to get to work.

1613
01:30:23.452 --> 01:30:26.051
- The city would offer that?
- The city?

1614
01:30:26.577 --> 01:30:29.389
Ah, ah! Let me repeat myself.

1615
01:30:30.155 --> 01:30:31.750
When was 1-minute this long?

1616
01:30:32.022 --> 01:30:33.521
You still have time, keep going.

1617
01:30:33.686 --> 01:30:37.482
Let me repeat the news.
Let me tell you again!

1618
01:30:38.467 --> 01:30:42.857
This is your 1-minute news. Isn't the
fine dust pollution horrible these days?

1619
01:30:42.959 --> 01:30:46.146
We've decided to offer free
bus shuttle services...

1620
01:30:46.780 --> 01:30:49.693
to make it easier for
everyone to move about.

1621
01:30:49.967 --> 01:30:51.654
- Please use it.
- Done!

1622
01:30:51.858 --> 01:30:56.053
- That's it. - I didn't know how
precious or long 1-minute could be.

1623
01:30:56.381 --> 01:30:58.419
That's right, I'm glad you realized that.

1624
01:30:58.444 --> 01:31:00.661
You can deliver great happiness
to a lot of people in 1-minute.

1625
01:31:00.686 --> 01:31:03.724
It was supposed to be AUA
News, not AUA Village News.

1626
01:31:03.749 --> 01:31:05.389
Well, the thing is...

1627
01:31:05.467 --> 01:31:07.404
there was a various...

1628
01:31:07.491 --> 01:31:11.661
- You were trying to relay the news for
different generation. - That's right!

1629
01:31:12.506 --> 01:31:14.662
Let's go. Live in three seconds.

1630
01:31:14.709 --> 01:31:17.912
Three, two, one, go.

1631
01:31:18.803 --> 01:31:19.803
Hello.

1632
01:31:21.436 --> 01:31:23.380
This is your AUA 1-minute News.

1633
01:31:23.405 --> 01:31:25.248
- Is he a DJ?
- Sounds like one.

1634
01:31:25.366 --> 01:31:29.303
Let me ask our audience members.
Are your kids okay?

1635
01:31:29.819 --> 01:31:34.756
I hear violence at school is
quite serious these days.

1636
01:31:35.467 --> 01:31:38.756
Unfortunately, this is
also happening around us.

1637
01:31:39.163 --> 01:31:41.959
A student attending AUA High School...

1638
01:31:42.100 --> 01:31:45.842
by the name of Kang Ho-dong,
recently displayed violence...

1639
01:31:46.131 --> 01:31:50.342
because another student by
the name of Yeo Woon-hyuk...

1640
01:31:50.795 --> 01:31:53.170
decided to wake him up in class.

1641
01:31:54.310 --> 01:31:56.811
The two students, Mr. Kang and Mr. Yeo...

1642
01:31:57.122 --> 01:31:58.122
He farted.

1643
01:31:58.850 --> 01:32:01.860
- He went in there to fart.
- used to be close friends but...

1644
01:32:01.885 --> 01:32:05.524
- The studio has been breached!
- What the heck?

1645
01:32:06.717 --> 01:32:08.500
I went in to catch bugs.

1646
01:32:08.928 --> 01:32:10.490
You're going too far.

1647
01:32:10.717 --> 01:32:14.571
- I made the noise with my lips.
- You want me to believe that?

1648
01:32:15.499 --> 01:32:19.178
Three, two, one! Start!

1649
01:32:21.225 --> 01:32:23.225
Hello, audience members.

1650
01:32:23.420 --> 01:32:29.497
This is Lee Soo-geun, JTBC's new
endeavor of AUA's 1-minute news.

1651
01:32:29.522 --> 01:32:33.667
I'll try my best to clearly
and vividly deliver...

1652
01:32:33.692 --> 01:32:38.800
the hottest news that
is trending these days.

1653
01:32:39.402 --> 01:32:43.589
One-minute news isn't about
rushing the news out to you...

1654
01:32:44.050 --> 01:32:47.212
but deliver a variety of...

1655
01:32:47.237 --> 01:32:50.714
happy, sad and other news to you.

1656
01:32:51.058 --> 01:32:53.181
How can his introduction take 30-seconds?

1657
01:32:53.207 --> 01:32:54.768
He hasn't given any news.

1658
01:32:54.792 --> 01:32:56.753
Why didn't you write something down?

1659
01:32:56.816 --> 01:32:59.510
- I still have 22-seconds left.
- This isn't the news!

1660
01:32:59.535 --> 01:33:03.847
Our very first guest,
Kim Je-dong, is here...

1661
01:33:04.300 --> 01:33:06.550
to tell you how to listen to our news.

1662
01:33:06.746 --> 01:33:09.369
Do you have any tips on
how to watch the news?

1663
01:33:09.394 --> 01:33:12.175
Yes, watch it with a comfortable heart.

1664
01:33:12.824 --> 01:33:15.386
This was your comfortable AUA News.

1665
01:33:16.394 --> 01:33:20.448
- He didn't do anything! - You can't
use time to show your imitations.

1666
01:33:20.683 --> 01:33:22.331
There wasn't any news at all!

1667
01:33:22.488 --> 01:33:24.808
I had our first guest, like the news.

1668
01:33:24.902 --> 01:33:29.612
- What did you do for the first 30-seconds?
- You just kept giving an introduction.

1669
01:33:30.277 --> 01:33:34.675
You need to tell the audience what
you're going to do on the first week.

1670
01:33:35.011 --> 01:33:37.440
- It was very witty.
- He approves.

1671
01:33:37.613 --> 01:33:39.994
The guest told you to watch
the news comfortably.

1672
01:33:40.019 --> 01:33:42.322
It's Hyun-min's turn, our rising star.

1673
01:33:42.347 --> 01:33:44.151
I'm looking forward to this.

1674
01:33:44.300 --> 01:33:45.997
- Mic test. - 3-seconds before we go live.

1675
01:33:46.023 --> 01:33:48.905
- Three, two , one. Cue.
- He looks good in there.

1676
01:33:49.855 --> 01:33:52.439
- Three, two , one. Cue.
- He looks good in there.

1677
01:33:52.464 --> 01:33:56.331
Hello, this is your announcer for
AUA 1-minute news, Han Hyun-min.

1678
01:33:56.597 --> 01:33:59.694
Recently, a transfer student to
AUA High School has become...

1679
01:33:59.719 --> 01:34:03.769
the ultimate trend from the way he
strides down the class hallways.

1680
01:34:03.831 --> 01:34:06.487
- Ultimate?
- Don't use slang! No slang!

1681
01:34:06.550 --> 01:34:09.847
On the other hand, AUA's students began
to protest by yelling, "Eba-Seba"...

1682
01:34:09.964 --> 01:34:13.878
when the cafeteria forgot to
serve eggs with their rice.

1683
01:34:14.050 --> 01:34:16.384
- What's "Eba-Seba"?
- What's he talking about?

1684
01:34:16.410 --> 01:34:20.389
In other recent news, the school
next to AUA High School..

1685
01:34:21.566 --> 01:34:23.440
Keep going. He's flustered.

1686
01:34:24.011 --> 01:34:27.550
Isn't it cold these days? Make
sure to wear warm clothes.

1687
01:34:28.027 --> 01:34:30.542
- Done!
- Wait a second!

1688
01:34:31.105 --> 01:34:32.683
He can't use slang!

1689
01:34:32.808 --> 01:34:35.847
Can't reporters be trendy
by using words like this?

1690
01:34:35.917 --> 01:34:38.690
We need to break through stereotypes.
That was amazing.

1691
01:34:39.027 --> 01:34:41.300
- That was good.
- What does 'Eba-Seba' mean?

1692
01:34:41.527 --> 01:34:43.253
(News showing the passion of teens)

1693
01:34:43.339 --> 01:34:47.292
- What does 'Eba-Seba' mean?
- It's kind of like, you're going too far.

1694
01:34:47.371 --> 01:34:49.776
- You're over-exaggerating?
- AUA is eba-seba.

1695
01:34:50.175 --> 01:34:52.558
- Good, it's Jang-hoon's turn.
- Great!

1696
01:34:52.855 --> 01:34:56.159
- Start.
- Hello, this is AUA's 1-minute news.

1697
01:34:56.472 --> 01:35:00.158
- Kim Yeong-cheol announced his third
single. - Everyone is talking about me.

1698
01:35:00.183 --> 01:35:03.916
We're counting down the days for
his third single to be released.

1699
01:35:03.941 --> 01:35:07.260
But some people are asking, "Why
does Kim Yeong-cheol keep singing?".

1700
01:35:07.285 --> 01:35:09.791
They ask, "Does Kim Yeong-cheol have
something over Yoon Jong-shin?".

1701
01:35:09.816 --> 01:35:13.221
There's also rumor that he's paying
for his own single releases.

1702
01:35:13.246 --> 01:35:16.736
Especially after we've heard
that one of the biggest...

1703
01:35:16.761 --> 01:35:19.855
stars will be featured
in his next music video.

1704
01:35:20.027 --> 01:35:22.514
Let me take a Polaroid, Seo Jang-hoon.

1705
01:35:23.167 --> 01:35:25.323
Can you show us a "V"?

1706
01:35:25.527 --> 01:35:29.894
Many of the reviews are stating
that people are more...

1707
01:35:30.238 --> 01:35:35.378
interested in the celebrity starring
his video than Kim Yeong-cheol's song.

1708
01:35:35.667 --> 01:35:38.526
We'll try our very best tomorrow as well.

1709
01:35:38.863 --> 01:35:40.421
Give me a "V" sign.

1710
01:35:41.371 --> 01:35:43.487
His news was perfect!

1711
01:35:44.214 --> 01:35:48.315
- You won't fall for sudden attacks.
- No, he didn't fall for your tricks.

1712
01:35:48.832 --> 01:35:51.757
Let's give a round of
applause to Jang-hoon.

1713
01:35:52.964 --> 01:35:55.011
We're going to discuss amongst ourselves...

1714
01:35:55.036 --> 01:35:59.097
on who was the best and choose
a winner of the competition.

1715
01:35:59.644 --> 01:36:01.228
Can you choose two people?

1716
01:36:01.253 --> 01:36:03.681
We decided that Da-hee
will choose the winner.

1717
01:36:03.707 --> 01:36:05.565
What if she chooses her ideal type instead?

1718
01:36:05.691 --> 01:36:08.769
- Da-hee!
- Stand in a line and look to the front.

1719
01:36:13.284 --> 01:36:15.120
(Picks things up)

1720
01:36:19.081 --> 01:36:21.573
This could be a commemoration.

1721
01:36:21.925 --> 01:36:23.558
One, two, three!

1722
01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:28.308
- Good job.
- Don't wave it around too much.

1723
01:36:29.496 --> 01:36:31.425
You can't shake it too much.

1724
01:36:31.699 --> 01:36:35.175
Da-hee is going to disqualify
you one at a time.

1725
01:36:35.457 --> 01:36:38.003
- Do I push them one by one?
- Yeah.

1726
01:36:40.472 --> 01:36:42.111
(The first to be disqualified: Hee-chul)

1727
01:36:42.136 --> 01:36:43.995
That's what I thought.

1728
01:36:44.363 --> 01:36:46.597
You offended me today.

1729
01:36:46.855 --> 01:36:48.647
It's because I'm prettier.

1730
01:36:49.151 --> 01:36:51.047
(Ho-dong is quickly disqualified)

1731
01:36:51.558 --> 01:36:54.572
I knew this would happen
when you did your news.

1732
01:36:54.597 --> 01:36:57.080
Stop talking and go away, Yeong-cheol!

1733
01:36:57.105 --> 01:36:58.655
There's three left.

1734
01:36:59.152 --> 01:37:03.206
- Good. - Jang-hoon is
anticipating, he's anticipating.

1735
01:37:03.347 --> 01:37:05.577
(Trying to control his expression)

1736
01:37:06.082 --> 01:37:08.010
(Kyung-hoon is 5th to be disqualified)

1737
01:37:08.035 --> 01:37:09.494
It's Jang-hoon versus Hyun-min.

1738
01:37:09.519 --> 01:37:11.940
You can hug the winner from the back.

1739
01:37:12.042 --> 01:37:14.303
- Stand closer.
- Come closer.

1740
01:37:16.996 --> 01:37:19.808
Spread your arms and stand straight.

1741
01:37:20.660 --> 01:37:23.308
- Look for your love...
- Your love?

1742
01:37:23.425 --> 01:37:25.534
- Go to the person you love.
- So suddenly?

1743
01:37:25.652 --> 01:37:30.378
Go and give a back hug to your choice.
One, two, three!

1744
01:37:31.542 --> 01:37:32.542
(Smiles)

1745
01:37:33.823 --> 01:37:37.300
Your fingers are too wide!
Your hands are too masculine.

1746
01:37:38.698 --> 01:37:41.163
(He gets caught because of his hands)

1747
01:37:41.785 --> 01:37:43.425
This is for real now.

1748
01:37:43.738 --> 01:37:46.167
Who will Da-hee choose?

1749
01:37:50.883 --> 01:37:53.733
(Who will Da-hee choose?)

1750
01:37:56.867 --> 01:37:58.772
(She chooses, Seo Jang-hoon)

1751
01:37:58.979 --> 01:38:00.362
(Embarrassed)

1752
01:38:01.171 --> 01:38:03.878
Congratulations, congratulations.

(Jang-hoon is chosen as the club
member and loved by Da-hee)

1754

(They take a picture of
commemorate the moment)

1756

1759
01:38:22.863 --> 01:38:25.769

1760
01:38:26.027 --> 01:38:27.408

(Ju-Ne has ambitious
imitations of PSY ready)

1765
01:38:36.770 --> 01:38:38.141

1766
01:38:38.166 --> 01:38:40.510
(He steals Ju-ne's moment)

1767

Good job, good job.

Follow along, Yeong-cheol.

1770

you just sit around!

(Seungri gets compliments
from Ho-dong and goes off)

1772
01:38:52.664 --> 01:38:55.111
I bet YG people are getting frustrated.

1773
