1
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.549
You are too harsh on me.

2
00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.450
Can't you just hug me once?

3
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.340
Be born again.

4
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.980
I will wait.

5
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.599
(Hae Ra)

6
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.899
(Hae Ra)

7
00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.530
Your call has been forwarded to...

8
00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.859
Wine was like a pie in the sky.

9
00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:11.870
This time, the chief director...

10
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.229
Why isn't he picking up?

11
00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:15.000
- I'm tired. - Gosh.

12
00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.169
But I'm not drunk.

13
00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:26.680
Hae Ra.

14
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.720
(Episode 17)

15
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.819
Full moon.

16
00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:35.960
Full moon.

17
00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:38.190
When the moon is full.

18
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.490
When the moon is full.

19
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.630
When the moon is full.

20
00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:51.069
What is she trying to say?

21
00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.280
I know.

22
00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.479
If the ring receives a ray of full moon beam,

23
00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:05.990
it gains strength to grant your wish.

24
00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.329
Boon Yi, what would you like to wish?

25
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.030
Secret.

26
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.240
It is cold. Let us go inside.

27
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.840
Tell me when we go inside.

28
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.039
What is your wish? Let me hear it.

29
00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:37.250
My wish is that...

30
00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:41.960
you would not receive poison as punishment.

31
00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:48.229
That is a difficult wish to come true.

32
00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:52.870
I asked that...

33
00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:56.900
you would not die...

34
00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.310
even if you drank the poison.

35
00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.819
Even if you drink the poison...

36
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.289
Whatever comes your way...

37
00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:18.459
I asked that...

38
00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.300
you never let go of your life...

39
00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.430
easily.

40
00:04:31.209 --> 00:04:32.509
You wished upon that ring.

41
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.649
Okay. Boon Yi.

42
00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:41.149
I will wear that ring...

43
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.449
when I receive poison.

44
00:04:46.649 --> 00:04:48.159
Which finger would fit?

45
00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:55.029
I do not like jokes.

46
00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:56.659
I am not joking.

47
00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:59.069
You made an earnest wish upon that ring.

48
00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.670
So it should be in contact with my skin.

49
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.670
I will put it in my inside pocket at least,

50
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.909
so I would never die.

51
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.850
Please do not die.

52
00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:13.850
I will not die.

53
00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.219
Never.

54
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.649
Not ever.

55
00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:38.170
I will not die.

56
00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:40.540
Never.

57
00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:43.909
Not ever.

58
00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:57.120
Die in there!

59
00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:01.230
Melt this ring, and make a new blade for this.

60
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.500
On the tiger's month, day, and hour,

61
00:06:05.829 --> 00:06:08.870
make a knife that is extremely hard and sharp.

62
00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:52.380
What is this?

63
00:06:56.819 --> 00:06:58.149
What is this dress?

64
00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.420
Answer me!

65
00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:04.290
Baek Hee.

66
00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:07.829
We have to leave.

67
00:07:11.569 --> 00:07:12.670
I...

68
00:07:15.699 --> 00:07:17.699
killed him.

69
00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:59.480
Soo Ho. Wake up.

70
00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.980
Open your eyes, Soo Ho.

71
00:08:18.399 --> 00:08:20.300
Soo Ho.

72
00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:23.000
No. You can't die.

73
00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.370
Soo Ho.

74
00:08:58.439 --> 00:08:59.769
Please come back.

75
00:09:00.939 --> 00:09:03.939
Please make him come back.

76
00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:07.980
Please save him.

77
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.889
Sharon. I brought stuff from Dongdaemun.

78
00:09:11.889 --> 00:09:13.120
They're...

79
00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:21.159
What happened...

80
00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:23.059
to Mr. Moon?

81
00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:24.799
Call an ambulance.

82
00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:30.470
That's Sharon's.

83
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:32.139
I said call an ambulance!

84
00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:35.009
Sharon.

85
00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:38.980
Sharon. Where are you?

86
00:09:39.649 --> 00:09:42.279
- Sharon. Where are you? - Wake up.

87
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:44.220
Please come back.

88
00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:48.490
Please let him live.

89
00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.309
Charge 200.

90
00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:15.019
Clear!

91
00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.120
Mr. Jung.

92
00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:54.820
Soo Ho.

93
00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:05.899
It's been so long.

94
00:11:05.899 --> 00:11:06.899
Soo Ho.

95
00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:09.340
You've become a decent, young man.

96
00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.909
I had so much to talk to you when I met you.

97
00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:18.380
I'm sorry,

98
00:11:19.049 --> 00:11:20.210
and thank you.

99
00:11:24.019 --> 00:11:25.950
Hae Ra and I are getting married.

100
00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:27.590
Soo Ho.

101
00:11:28.289 --> 00:11:29.289
Yes?

102
00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.460
You...

103
00:11:31.929 --> 00:11:34.330
shouldn't be here. Go back.

104
00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:39.529
Did you forget your promise with Hae Ra?

105
00:11:43.899 --> 00:11:45.039
Soo Ho.

106
00:11:45.669 --> 00:11:46.909
Soo Ho.

107
00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:03.220
Soo Ho...

108
00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:14.939
His pulse is stable,

109
00:12:14.939 --> 00:12:16.700
so he'll regain his consciousness soon.

110
00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:18.169
Let's wait and see.

111
00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:21.980
His heart stopped due to excessive bleeding?

112
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:23.710
Yes.

113
00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:26.549
Strangely, he didn't have any external injury...

114
00:12:26.549 --> 00:12:28.279
that could've caused excessive bleeding.

115
00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:31.689
We did a checkup on him to see if it was a stroke,

116
00:12:31.689 --> 00:12:33.019
but it wasn't.

117
00:12:33.689 --> 00:12:35.590
We've never had such a case before.

118
00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:38.630
So we need to wait and see his condition first.

119
00:12:44.669 --> 00:12:46.000
What happened?

120
00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:48.500
Are you the one who called the ambulance?

121
00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:52.409
Where was he?

122
00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:55.240
Let's talk outside.

123
00:12:58.149 --> 00:12:59.809
At Sharon Tailor?

124
00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.450
I think he came to try on his wedding suit.

125
00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:05.889
What do you mean?

126
00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:07.549
We're supposed to make...

127
00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:10.360
a dress and a suit for your wedding.

128
00:13:10.659 --> 00:13:11.730
What?

129
00:13:13.159 --> 00:13:15.100
You didn't get any call from Sharon, did you?

130
00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:17.700
Don't meet her even if she does.

131
00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:25.870
When did he ask you...

132
00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:27.039
to make them?

133
00:13:27.039 --> 00:13:30.179
Mr. Moon didn't ask it himself.

134
00:13:30.539 --> 00:13:31.850
Then who...

135
00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.279
It was Baek Hee.

136
00:13:36.019 --> 00:13:38.519
That was why Mr. Moon said he'd wear it.

137
00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:43.860
Why did she ask such a favor?

138
00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.289
I don't know.

139
00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:48.860
And...

140
00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:52.700
I really don't want to say this...

141
00:13:57.039 --> 00:13:59.710
I saw Sharon's silver knife...

142
00:14:00.509 --> 00:14:03.639
dropped next to Mr. Moon.

143
00:14:05.279 --> 00:14:07.210
I didn't see it in the ambulance.

144
00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:09.220
When he was down unconscious,

145
00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:12.820
Baek Hee was with him.

146
00:14:17.929 --> 00:14:19.429
Where's she now?

147
00:14:31.439 --> 00:14:32.669
Get changed.

148
00:14:32.669 --> 00:14:33.939
I don't want to see you in that.

149
00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:38.350
Are the police looking for me...

150
00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.250
to arrest me as a murder suspect?

151
00:14:41.679 --> 00:14:44.049
He fortunately saved his life.

152
00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:55.929
He's alive?

153
00:15:02.169 --> 00:15:03.299
I am...

154
00:15:05.539 --> 00:15:07.240
giving up on you.

155
00:15:12.909 --> 00:15:14.850
I don't want to see you anymore.

156
00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:17.850
Baek Hee.

157
00:15:20.289 --> 00:15:21.759
Leave this country.

158
00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:27.460
Don't think about showing yourself before the two.

159
00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.100
Don't you think you're too harsh on me?

160
00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:34.230
Shall I report you to the police...

161
00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.299
that a 200-year-old monster...

162
00:15:37.299 --> 00:15:39.110
tried to hurt a person?

163
00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:42.139
You made me this way.

164
00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:43.439
Yes.

165
00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:47.509
Just kill me instead, Sharon.

166
00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:50.250
And have your revenge.

167
00:16:13.009 --> 00:16:14.309
What happened?

168
00:16:14.309 --> 00:16:16.139
Tell me in detail.

169
00:16:16.139 --> 00:16:17.610
He's a bit hurt.

170
00:16:17.779 --> 00:16:20.149
Don't worry too much. I think he'll recover soon.

171
00:16:20.149 --> 00:16:22.820
Where did he get hurt that he's in the hospital?

172
00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:24.120
He got into a car accident?

173
00:16:24.889 --> 00:16:26.990
He sort of overworked.

174
00:16:27.549 --> 00:16:29.059
He'll recover soon.

175
00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:31.389
Did you call his employees?

176
00:16:31.429 --> 00:16:32.429
Not yet.

177
00:16:33.429 --> 00:16:35.399
I'll go nurse him from tomorrow morning.

178
00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:37.929
I'll call you later.

179
00:16:40.269 --> 00:16:43.600
Goodness, what's going on?

180
00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:47.409
He went to work with a smile on his face earlier.

181
00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:49.779
(Sharon Tailor)

182
00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:53.210
Hello?

183
00:16:53.909 --> 00:16:56.380
Yes, you heard the news.

184
00:16:57.049 --> 00:16:58.419
Right.

185
00:16:58.689 --> 00:17:00.689
He's in Haneul Hospital.

186
00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:05.689
It's okay.

187
00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:08.760
Don't mind me,

188
00:17:08.999 --> 00:17:10.499
and take your time, Hae Ra.

189
00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:12.870
I'm not hungry.

190
00:17:35.889 --> 00:17:38.290
I think he's reacting to sounds.

191
00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:42.100
I told you he'll regain his consciousness soon.

192
00:17:44.229 --> 00:17:45.770
I'll check his condition,

193
00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:47.770
so you may stay outside for a bit.

194
00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:51.100
His guardian will arrive soon.

195
00:17:52.409 --> 00:17:53.439
Well, then.

196
00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:04.550
Mr. Moon Soo Ho.

197
00:18:05.249 --> 00:18:06.550
Do you hear me?

198
00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.320
Move your fingers again.

199
00:18:13.189 --> 00:18:14.389
Good.

200
00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:17.830
Open your eyes.

201
00:18:56.939 --> 00:18:58.510
(Dr. Park Ji Yeon)

202
00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:35.580
I told you to be born again.

203
00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:28.530
Soo Ho.

204
00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:34.499
Are you awake?

205
00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:37.070
Where am I?

206
00:20:38.169 --> 00:20:39.639
You're in the hospital.

207
00:21:01.699 --> 00:21:05.870
(Haneul Hospital)

208
00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:11.139
Don't worry about me, and get to work.

209
00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:14.370
Do you feel pain, or does it ache anywhere?

210
00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:15.610
Not at all.

211
00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:17.209
I feel much better than usual.

212
00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:21.550
Do you not remember why you came here?

213
00:21:23.979 --> 00:21:25.090
I suddenly felt dizzy...

214
00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:27.189
and feverish, so I came to the emergency room.

215
00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:30.320
Yesterday,

216
00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:32.689
it was odd that there was no wound...

217
00:21:32.689 --> 00:21:34.530
even though you bled a lot.

218
00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:36.630
I didn't bleed.

219
00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:38.130
I walked in here myself.

220
00:21:40.229 --> 00:21:42.300
Do you know where you left your clothes?

221
00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:44.810
That's what I don't know.

222
00:21:46.669 --> 00:21:47.979
That's odd.

223
00:21:48.679 --> 00:21:50.010
You'll be late. Get to work.

224
00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:51.409
I'll be fine.

225
00:21:51.449 --> 00:21:55.380
The temperature dropped to minus 16.3°C.

226
00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:57.280
I'll call you.

227
00:21:59.419 --> 00:22:02.120
But the wind is less harsh than yesterday.

228
00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:04.360
You can't tell what will happen with the weather.

229
00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:05.459
Bye.

230
00:22:06.429 --> 00:22:08.560
But it will stay pretty cold.

231
00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:11.729
Other areas may drop to minus 8°C.

232
00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:13.899
Soo Ho.

233
00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:17.770
Forgive me.

234
00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:23.739
For you,

235
00:22:25.749 --> 00:22:27.820
Hae Ra, and Sharon,

236
00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:32.389
you must forget about today.

237
00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:39.530
What happened last night?

238
00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:43.659
Next news.

239
00:22:43.659 --> 00:22:46.199
The town that was selected for the city revival...

240
00:22:46.199 --> 00:22:50.100
demands the decision to be cancelled.

241
00:22:50.169 --> 00:22:51.239
For whom...

242
00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:54.310
are we reviving this town for,

243
00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:57.080
and for whom are we preserving this?

244
00:22:57.709 --> 00:23:01.080
The taxpayers' money will be used for this,

245
00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:05.489
and people point out that this profits no one.

246
00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.520
Do we have to continue this project?

247
00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:37.179
She's slacking off right after her promotion.

248
00:23:37.179 --> 00:23:38.290
Hae Ra, I mean.

249
00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:40.290
You have to give her a break.

250
00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:42.459
Mr. Moon suddenly got hospitalized.

251
00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:46.030
She did send the proposal late in the night.

252
00:23:46.229 --> 00:23:48.360
She sent an email while she was nursing him.

253
00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.600
Really? I'll check.

254
00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:51.969
Oh, right. Sir.

255
00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:54.469
We're going to go...

256
00:23:54.469 --> 00:23:56.439
and visit Mr. Moon during our lunch time.

257
00:23:57.370 --> 00:23:58.639
- I'll let you go. - Okay.

258
00:23:58.639 --> 00:24:00.010
Only if I like your proposal.

259
00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:01.880
- Come on, you... - Understood?

260
00:24:08.219 --> 00:24:10.120
You clearly told me that yesterday.

261
00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:12.719
You saw Sharon's knife, but not in the ambulance.

262
00:24:12.719 --> 00:24:13.820
You said...

263
00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:15.860
Baek Hee was there when Soo Ho collapsed.

264
00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:16.889
I did?

265
00:24:16.889 --> 00:24:19.090
Yes, you did. In front of the emergency room.

266
00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:21.499
When did I say that?

267
00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:34.610
Why do you suddenly need your passport?

268
00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:39.550
Something came up.

269
00:24:42.249 --> 00:24:43.749
Please take care of...

270
00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:46.449
Sharon Tailor while I'm gone.

271
00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:49.560
You're the owner...

272
00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:50.889
and the chief designer for a while.

273
00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:55.130
How long will you be gone for?

274
00:24:57.199 --> 00:24:58.300
I don't know.

275
00:25:00.729 --> 00:25:02.239
And what happened yesterday?

276
00:25:04.969 --> 00:25:07.469
Why was your knife...

277
00:25:07.909 --> 00:25:10.380
on the floor next to Mr. Moon?

278
00:25:12.909 --> 00:25:14.719
What happened?

279
00:25:19.649 --> 00:25:20.919
Seung Goo.

280
00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:24.459
Come here.

281
00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:26.929
Let me give you a bottle of perfume as a gift.

282
00:25:41.739 --> 00:25:43.010
Yesterday,

283
00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:46.610
nothing happened, Seung Goo.

284
00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:50.249
Nothing.

285
00:25:55.290 --> 00:25:57.320
Then why were you at the hospital?

286
00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:00.630
Yesterday? I was there because my stomach...

287
00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:02.600
suddenly got upset, and I saw you there.

288
00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:04.360
I got sick after eating a bowl of noodles...

289
00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:06.370
as I shopped for materials in Dongdaemun area.

290
00:26:13.409 --> 00:26:16.610
(Blood Test Result, all normal)

291
00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:19.749
I've never seen anyone who recovered so quickly.

292
00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:22.919
This is unique.

293
00:26:23.749 --> 00:26:25.790
Any headaches or dizziness?

294
00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:27.389
Not at all.

295
00:26:27.389 --> 00:26:30.219
But let's stay another day and see how you feel.

296
00:26:30.219 --> 00:26:32.060
I'm feeling great.

297
00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:33.729
I think I can go home right away.

298
00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:35.699
Then...

299
00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:39.070
come back immediately if you feel weird.

300
00:26:39.729 --> 00:26:40.969
I will.

301
00:26:48.409 --> 00:26:50.510
Where did you go last night without telling me?

302
00:26:54.949 --> 00:26:56.850
At my shop.

303
00:26:57.949 --> 00:26:59.489
I saw that you cleaned up everything.

304
00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:02.459
Did you get a call...

305
00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:04.219
from the hospital?

306
00:27:04.219 --> 00:27:05.830
Why do you want to know?

307
00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:08.860
You're going to leave soon.

308
00:27:09.959 --> 00:27:11.100
He's...

309
00:27:11.999 --> 00:27:13.600
alive, right?

310
00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:23.439
He's not someone you can recklessly hurt.

311
00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:26.510
If you do that again,

312
00:27:27.919 --> 00:27:29.449
I will tell the police.

313
00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:31.949
Remember that.

314
00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:51.439
Soo Ho...

315
00:27:51.909 --> 00:27:54.110
I have to forget about last night...

316
00:27:54.739 --> 00:27:56.380
because of what you just said, correct?

317
00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:18.600
Ms. Choi.

318
00:28:24.399 --> 00:28:26.169
It looks like you were about to run away.

319
00:28:29.909 --> 00:28:31.249
Are you insane?

320
00:28:32.449 --> 00:28:34.949
You lived over 200 years, and you can do magic.

321
00:28:34.949 --> 00:28:37.149
You can go anywhere without that.

322
00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:41.020
Do you remember that?

323
00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:43.989
I do remember, but it means nothing.

324
00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:46.229
What's important is that you're a killer.

325
00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:00.610
I came to ask a question.

326
00:29:06.909 --> 00:29:08.249
Did you...

327
00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:11.219
stab Soo Ho yesterday?

328
00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:19.030
Ms. Jang, you know something, don't you?

329
00:29:19.729 --> 00:29:22.399
You're hiding something. Are you not?

330
00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:27.939
Seung Goo said...

331
00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:31.169
he saw Sharon's knife next to Soo Ho.

332
00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:33.909
Although he said something different today.

333
00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:39.449
Let's go to the police station. We'll talk there.

334
00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:01.270
I made them wedding garments.

335
00:30:03.639 --> 00:30:05.840
That means I can probably die now.

336
00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:11.280
I...

337
00:30:12.979 --> 00:30:15.919
still don't know what I did wrong.

338
00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:15.580
What?

339
00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:19.149
Someone jumped off!

340
00:31:20.510 --> 00:31:21.520
What?

341
00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:22.979
Someone jumped off the bridge!

342
00:31:23.719 --> 00:31:25.889
Goodness. Call an ambulance!

343
00:31:25.889 --> 00:31:27.189
Hi. I need an ambulance.

344
00:31:27.189 --> 00:31:29.320
Someone just jumped off a bridge.

345
00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:31.860
Yes, a person jumped into the river.

346
00:31:43.739 --> 00:31:45.639
Goodness, Mr. Moon.

347
00:31:45.639 --> 00:31:46.870
Are you all right?

348
00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:49.010
Are you okay to be out of the hospital so soon?

349
00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:50.409
I'm fine.

350
00:31:50.679 --> 00:31:52.550
What was wrong?

351
00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:54.179
The hospital misdiagnosed.

352
00:31:56.449 --> 00:31:58.419
What's wrong with Hae Ra?

353
00:31:58.550 --> 00:32:01.050
Aunt Sook Hee. Please make her a hot cup of tea.

354
00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:02.360
Okay.

355
00:32:04.219 --> 00:32:05.229
Let's go.

356
00:32:17.753 --> 00:32:22.753
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E17 Black Knight "Be Born Again"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

357
00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:36.820
That woman...

358
00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:42.459
I hope the police find her.

359
00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:46.100
Right. Get some sleep.

360
00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:50.239
I didn't dream it, did I?

361
00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:53.909
You saw what I saw, right?

362
00:32:55.679 --> 00:32:57.239
Don't think about it, Hae Ra.

363
00:32:57.580 --> 00:32:58.979
The police will find her.

364
00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:22.399
Have you found the body yet?

365
00:33:23.199 --> 00:33:24.540
We haven't found her yet.

366
00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:26.169
We'll keep looking.

367
00:33:26.709 --> 00:33:28.310
Please continue the search.

368
00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:35.979
I want you to show the document...

369
00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:39.320
and the letter of prayer to Hae Ra.

370
00:33:39.790 --> 00:33:41.389
Wouldn't that confuse her?

371
00:33:42.189 --> 00:33:44.159
It's up to her to believe it or not.

372
00:33:46.929 --> 00:33:48.199
All right.

373
00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:55.139
Is there something...

374
00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:56.939
you want to tell me?

375
00:33:58.040 --> 00:33:59.169
Sharon...

376
00:34:00.739 --> 00:34:02.810
stabbed you with a knife

377
00:34:05.709 --> 00:34:07.749
I felt your pulse,

378
00:34:09.749 --> 00:34:11.490
so I hid the knife.

379
00:34:14.149 --> 00:34:15.289
Why?

380
00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:17.689
To protect the three of you.

381
00:34:18.590 --> 00:34:21.229
Nothing good will come of it,

382
00:34:22.599 --> 00:34:24.059
if the story gets out.

383
00:34:27.499 --> 00:34:28.840
So you tried to erase...

384
00:34:29.939 --> 00:34:32.169
what happened from my memory.

385
00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:38.309
It doesn't really work with you.

386
00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:43.249
Did Choi Seo Rin...

387
00:34:43.579 --> 00:34:45.019
really die?

388
00:34:45.890 --> 00:34:46.919
No.

389
00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:49.890
But...

390
00:34:51.689 --> 00:34:53.930
you can consider her as dead.

391
00:34:55.930 --> 00:34:59.300
Because she won't come between you two anymore.

392
00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:03.340
She had...

393
00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:08.709
jumped into the river twice before.

394
00:35:19.189 --> 00:35:20.619
After 30 years.

395
00:35:28.099 --> 00:35:29.599
And after 50 years...

396
00:35:39.809 --> 00:35:41.309
She came back.

397
00:36:03.499 --> 00:36:08.039
4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

398
00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:11.840
Mr. Moon. You've been busy lately, haven't you?

399
00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:14.780
No, because my business isn't going well.

400
00:36:15.539 --> 00:36:16.539
Still...

401
00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:19.050
I feel a good vibe.

402
00:36:19.479 --> 00:36:20.979
Everything will work out.

403
00:36:21.619 --> 00:36:22.820
Since it's been a while,

404
00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:24.490
let's do just 10 first.

405
00:36:29.459 --> 00:36:30.459
One.

406
00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:33.530
Two.

407
00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:36.630
96.

408
00:36:38.499 --> 00:36:39.729
97.

409
00:36:41.669 --> 00:36:42.740
98.

410
00:36:44.869 --> 00:36:45.939
99.

411
00:36:47.809 --> 00:36:50.209
100. Mr. Moon, you can stop now.

412
00:36:55.450 --> 00:36:58.349
Mr. Moon, have you been eating healthy food?

413
00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:11.869
Our stocks are crazy.

414
00:37:11.899 --> 00:37:13.430
Amazing.

415
00:37:19.209 --> 00:37:20.269
Mr. Moon.

416
00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:21.579
Good morning.

417
00:37:21.579 --> 00:37:22.840
Yes, good morning.

418
00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:26.450
Mr. Moon, it's really strange.

419
00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:27.780
What is?

420
00:37:28.119 --> 00:37:30.849
The Jinju stock you recommend...

421
00:37:30.849 --> 00:37:32.950
has been going up for four days straight.

422
00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:36.220
Thank you, Mr. Moon.

423
00:37:37.519 --> 00:37:40.630
Did you know A2 Group was going to be taken over?

424
00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:43.229
No. I recommended it...

425
00:37:43.229 --> 00:37:44.970
because the company seemed reliable.

426
00:37:45.229 --> 00:37:47.729
Be careful since it can be a strategy.

427
00:37:48.399 --> 00:37:50.039
Also,

428
00:37:50.539 --> 00:37:53.010
the Red Techno stocks you told me to sell,

429
00:37:53.269 --> 00:37:55.880
the value went down as soon as I sold it.

430
00:37:56.579 --> 00:37:58.610
Do you have a sixth sense or something?

431
00:38:04.789 --> 00:38:06.119
After you arrive,

432
00:38:06.119 --> 00:38:07.749
it'd be good to take a rest...

433
00:38:07.749 --> 00:38:09.590
before going to dinner, right?

434
00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:10.789
Sure.

435
00:38:10.789 --> 00:38:12.490
- Of course. - Of course.

436
00:38:12.729 --> 00:38:14.499
Relax in your hotel room for a little bit.

437
00:38:14.499 --> 00:38:16.459
Get changed into nice clothes.

438
00:38:16.459 --> 00:38:17.599
Fix your makeup too.

439
00:38:17.599 --> 00:38:19.800
I bought new clothes.

440
00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:22.269
We'll have to put on a nice lipstick.

441
00:38:22.269 --> 00:38:23.999
There are 55 of us,

442
00:38:23.999 --> 00:38:26.869
but you planned the itinerary so well.

443
00:38:26.939 --> 00:38:30.539
I think you're the best in Korea.

444
00:38:30.539 --> 00:38:32.079
No, you're the best in Asia.

445
00:38:32.079 --> 00:38:33.410
Isn't she the best in the world?

446
00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:35.380
- You're right. - Thank you.

447
00:38:35.649 --> 00:38:38.689
Thank you. Thank you for your compliment.

448
00:38:48.999 --> 00:38:49.999
Hae Ra.

449
00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:52.229
Do I look any different?

450
00:38:54.130 --> 00:38:55.269
No. Why do you ask?

451
00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:57.599
I think I'm feeling better,

452
00:38:57.599 --> 00:38:58.809
and I've gained more muscles too.

453
00:38:58.809 --> 00:39:00.039
That's good.

454
00:39:01.579 --> 00:39:02.579
Also...

455
00:39:04.749 --> 00:39:05.950
Never mind.

456
00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:08.280
What is it?

457
00:39:08.619 --> 00:39:10.919
I recommended a stock to my employees,

458
00:39:10.919 --> 00:39:12.450
and that hit the jackpot.

459
00:39:14.249 --> 00:39:15.890
Don't do such things. It's dangerous.

460
00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:17.890
I told them not to.

461
00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:19.289
I just thought it was interesting.

462
00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:24.099
I'm meeting Ms. Jang this evening.

463
00:39:24.229 --> 00:39:25.669
She asked to have dinner with me.

464
00:39:26.099 --> 00:39:27.669
Okay. Have a good time.

465
00:39:31.439 --> 00:39:33.269
I can trust her, right?

466
00:39:36.479 --> 00:39:37.640
I trust her.

467
00:39:52.430 --> 00:39:53.860
Why did you want to see me?

468
00:39:55.059 --> 00:39:57.599
I had a dream.

469
00:39:58.669 --> 00:40:02.240
I was on top of a shiny building,

470
00:40:02.769 --> 00:40:06.340
and I looked down...

471
00:40:06.709 --> 00:40:07.769
at the streets of Seoul.

472
00:40:09.410 --> 00:40:11.039
It's a dream about falling.

473
00:40:11.410 --> 00:40:12.510
Be careful.

474
00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:19.189
Let me...

475
00:40:22.019 --> 00:40:24.189
meet with Seo Rin.

476
00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:31.599
You two are so similar.

477
00:40:32.329 --> 00:40:34.470
You have crazy obsessions.

478
00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:36.939
Where is Seo Rin?

479
00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:38.439
She's dead.

480
00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:48.579
Seo Rin doesn't get old, and she never dies.

481
00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:52.249
Find her if you can.

482
00:40:53.519 --> 00:40:55.019
I'm curious too.

483
00:41:00.689 --> 00:41:02.399
Seo Rin.

484
00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:05.829
I loved her so much.

485
00:41:08.499 --> 00:41:10.399
Even if he manages...

486
00:41:10.399 --> 00:41:12.740
to escape from the lab fire case,

487
00:41:13.169 --> 00:41:15.340
There are many ways to corner him...

488
00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:17.809
like preferential loan and embezzlement.

489
00:41:17.809 --> 00:41:19.680
We have to put him in jail for the fire case.

490
00:41:20.709 --> 00:41:22.849
Don't worry. Things will work out well.

491
00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:25.249
Okay.

492
00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:31.260
Mr. Yoon cannot be reached.

493
00:41:40.099 --> 00:41:41.970
You suspect us...

494
00:41:41.970 --> 00:41:43.439
whenever something happens.

495
00:41:45.269 --> 00:41:48.039
No, I really don't know anything.

496
00:41:55.119 --> 00:41:57.450
Give Yoon Dal Hong his land back already.

497
00:41:58.149 --> 00:41:59.189
Dad.

498
00:41:59.189 --> 00:42:01.619
Don't ever see him again.

499
00:42:02.059 --> 00:42:03.720
Don't be curious...

500
00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:06.189
about his whereabouts either if he disappears.

501
00:42:27.079 --> 00:42:28.079
Young Mi.

502
00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:32.590
We need to talk.

503
00:42:34.619 --> 00:42:37.519
Hye Young, can you clean up the second floor first?

504
00:42:38.059 --> 00:42:39.729
Okay.

505
00:42:43.059 --> 00:42:44.160
Speak.

506
00:42:55.809 --> 00:42:57.240
Tell me honestly...

507
00:42:58.849 --> 00:43:00.180
about what you know.

508
00:43:01.519 --> 00:43:02.649
I know nothing.

509
00:43:04.450 --> 00:43:06.919
You said my father set a fire to the lab...

510
00:43:08.119 --> 00:43:10.519
and killed Hae Ra's father.

511
00:43:10.519 --> 00:43:11.990
You wanted to break up with me,

512
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:13.430
so I made up a story out of anger.

513
00:43:14.559 --> 00:43:16.229
I told you it was a lie.

514
00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:17.599
My father is a pathetic man...

515
00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:23.499
who became evil because he was ignorant.

516
00:43:25.309 --> 00:43:26.970
Help him stop from becoming more evil.

517
00:43:27.979 --> 00:43:30.510
Did anything else happen that I don't know of?

518
00:43:32.349 --> 00:43:33.450
Tell me.

519
00:43:34.749 --> 00:43:36.050
Tell me what you know.

520
00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:46.990
- Drink it. - You know I hung out...

521
00:43:46.990 --> 00:43:50.160
with delinquents for a while, right?

522
00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:52.099
- Will we become men too? - Goodness.

523
00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:54.869
I want to pee.

524
00:43:55.169 --> 00:43:57.200
Here. Do it here.

525
00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:59.669
- Here. - Hey, I'm sophisticated.

526
00:43:59.669 --> 00:44:01.579
Sophisticated, my foot.

527
00:44:01.579 --> 00:44:04.380
You think you're a noble woman or what?

528
00:44:04.610 --> 00:44:06.209
- Gosh, it's cold. - Drink up.

529
00:44:06.209 --> 00:44:07.249
I won't.

530
00:44:07.249 --> 00:44:09.119
You set a fire on the lab, didn't you?

531
00:44:09.119 --> 00:44:10.780
How could you do that?

532
00:44:11.119 --> 00:44:13.390
Don't accuse an innocent man.

533
00:44:13.390 --> 00:44:15.360
Let's go to the police. Let's talk there.

534
00:44:16.059 --> 00:44:17.590
Are you all innocent?

535
00:44:17.619 --> 00:44:19.789
You snuck out Doctor Moon's research paper...

536
00:44:19.789 --> 00:44:21.229
to earn money.

537
00:44:21.959 --> 00:44:25.369
You'll be the first to be suspected.

538
00:44:25.399 --> 00:44:27.399
And I'll take the responsibility for it.

539
00:44:27.399 --> 00:44:28.869
I'm prepared.

540
00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:34.039
So you earned enough money, is that right?

541
00:44:34.039 --> 00:44:35.579
I can't let it slide.

542
00:44:35.579 --> 00:44:38.479
You may kill me too in the future.

543
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:40.610
Right.

544
00:44:41.010 --> 00:44:45.189
You two always treated me like I'm the bad one.

545
00:44:45.789 --> 00:44:48.990
You're twisted out of inferior complex.

546
00:44:49.559 --> 00:44:50.990
Inferior complex?

547
00:44:53.559 --> 00:44:56.200
You punk. You're insane.

548
00:44:56.559 --> 00:44:57.700
You jerk.

549
00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:17.720
Hey...

550
00:45:19.189 --> 00:45:21.760
Hey, get up.

551
00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:35.570
And...

552
00:45:36.970 --> 00:45:38.610
he carried Hae Ra's father on his back...

553
00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:41.610
and got on his car.

554
00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:46.910
I thought he was going to a hospital.

555
00:45:49.249 --> 00:45:51.720
But I heard a different story later.

556
00:45:53.249 --> 00:45:54.890
Why didn't you tell others then?

557
00:45:58.459 --> 00:46:00.660
Because of Park Gon,

558
00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:02.030
the class president of Hanguk Middle School.

559
00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:05.769
I kept silent because of you.

560
00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:10.599
Your family moved to an expensive apartment.

561
00:46:11.669 --> 00:46:12.970
You got a new car.

562
00:46:13.669 --> 00:46:15.840
I liked seeing you live a better life.

563
00:46:18.149 --> 00:46:19.249
Young Mi.

564
00:46:21.450 --> 00:46:23.450
I lied to Hae Ra...

565
00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:26.189
that my parents...

566
00:46:27.019 --> 00:46:28.890
checked how he died in the hospital.

567
00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:37.329
Until now,

568
00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:40.930
we've made it without any problem.

569
00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:44.769
No one knows about it.

570
00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:48.910
Let's keep it a secret between me and you.

571
00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:16.399
It's surprising...

572
00:47:16.399 --> 00:47:18.369
that your story was found in the grave.

573
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:21.809
But I don't believe in a past life.

574
00:47:24.550 --> 00:47:26.479
It doesn't matter even if you don't believe it.

575
00:47:27.209 --> 00:47:30.149
But it's true that such things happened...

576
00:47:30.619 --> 00:47:31.890
in the past.

577
00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:37.390
If your story is all true,

578
00:47:39.689 --> 00:47:42.630
and Choi Seo Rin is an immortal being,

579
00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:46.769
then she'll appear again.

580
00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:50.269
Maybe when you two...

581
00:47:51.439 --> 00:47:54.010
become a happy old couple.

582
00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:57.740
If she appears before my eyes again,

583
00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:02.680
I think I'll be able to believe in all this story.

584
00:48:04.689 --> 00:48:07.649
When you're upset or confused,

585
00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:09.890
tell me anytime.

586
00:48:12.959 --> 00:48:14.499
Is Sharon Tailor...

587
00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:17.099
still closed?

588
00:48:18.070 --> 00:48:20.369
Seung Goo is working hard to run it.

589
00:48:20.829 --> 00:48:22.369
Pay a visit some time,

590
00:48:22.369 --> 00:48:23.939
and keep him company.

591
00:48:24.809 --> 00:48:26.169
He must be lonely.

592
00:48:28.209 --> 00:48:30.880
Okay, I'll visit there one day.

593
00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:30.340
Stop it.

594
00:50:32.970 --> 00:50:34.399
Did you talk with her all right?

595
00:50:34.769 --> 00:50:35.899
Yes.

596
00:50:36.369 --> 00:50:37.470
But...

597
00:50:38.369 --> 00:50:39.910
I don't believe in the old story.

598
00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:41.979
Then don't.

599
00:50:42.709 --> 00:50:43.809
But...

600
00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:47.649
I think it's true that we're meant to be.

601
00:50:50.050 --> 00:50:51.050
Hae Ra.

602
00:50:51.789 --> 00:50:53.289
Do you know what my dream is?

603
00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:54.890
What is it?

604
00:51:00.430 --> 00:51:02.329
To grow old with you like them.

605
00:51:04.869 --> 00:51:05.970
Is that all?

606
00:51:07.630 --> 00:51:08.740
That's all.

607
00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:13.709
That's very simple.

608
00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:17.610
Let's make our wedding pictures...

609
00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:20.149
look really great and wonderful.

610
00:51:20.649 --> 00:51:21.649
Okay.

611
00:51:22.820 --> 00:51:25.789
Let's live a happy and healthy life.

612
00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:29.419
Let us do that.

613
00:51:42.669 --> 00:51:43.970
Hey, stop the car.

614
00:51:48.209 --> 00:51:49.809
- Did you see that? - What?

615
00:51:52.149 --> 00:51:53.649
This is Lee Hyun Sik of patrol car three.

616
00:51:53.950 --> 00:51:55.619
Was there any other suicide report?

617
00:51:55.619 --> 00:51:58.189
None. There has been no other suicide today.

618
00:51:59.849 --> 00:52:01.019
That's odd.

619
00:52:01.189 --> 00:52:02.289
What is it?

620
00:52:03.419 --> 00:52:06.090
I just saw a woman's head right above the water.

621
00:52:06.090 --> 00:52:07.490
What are you talking about?

622
00:52:07.490 --> 00:52:09.499
Han River is completely frozen today.

623
00:52:11.229 --> 00:52:12.229
Let's go.

624
00:52:12.399 --> 00:52:13.399
Okay.

625
00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:42.999
Hey, Sharon!

626
00:52:55.709 --> 00:52:58.249
I got confused for a second.

627
00:53:01.249 --> 00:53:02.820
You must miss her a lot.

628
00:53:03.419 --> 00:53:05.119
No, I don't.

629
00:53:07.289 --> 00:53:10.390
I was going to brag about my new design.

630
00:53:10.919 --> 00:53:12.090
Seung Goo.

631
00:53:13.059 --> 00:53:14.599
For the next 30 years,

632
00:53:16.059 --> 00:53:18.099
no, maybe 50 years,

633
00:53:20.829 --> 00:53:23.840
can you keep this place as good as today?

634
00:53:24.570 --> 00:53:26.010
Is Sharon...

635
00:53:26.809 --> 00:53:28.340
gone for good?

636
00:53:29.140 --> 00:53:30.380
I don't know either.

637
00:53:34.180 --> 00:53:35.720
No.

638
00:53:37.220 --> 00:53:38.689
I don't think I can.

639
00:53:41.619 --> 00:53:43.360
If she doesn't come back,

640
00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:46.490
I'm going to ruin this place and sell it off.

641
00:54:02.209 --> 00:54:03.280
Sharon.

642
00:54:06.110 --> 00:54:07.180
I guess...

643
00:54:09.349 --> 00:54:12.249
there is someone that misses you.

644
00:54:15.289 --> 00:54:16.390
Father.

645
00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:17.860
Mother.

646
00:54:18.660 --> 00:54:21.360
I am here. It is me, Seo Rin.

647
00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:23.899
Please come out.

648
00:54:25.669 --> 00:54:27.369
I am here.

649
00:54:27.729 --> 00:54:28.740
Yes.

650
00:54:29.039 --> 00:54:30.369
Father.

651
00:54:30.369 --> 00:54:33.110
There used to be people that loved you.

652
00:54:39.149 --> 00:54:40.910
Once you graduate from dressmaking school,

653
00:54:41.249 --> 00:54:43.079
let's return to Joseon.

654
00:54:44.079 --> 00:54:46.289
I'm sure everyone who remembers us...

655
00:54:46.349 --> 00:54:48.559
are all long gone.

656
00:54:48.689 --> 00:54:50.619
How long do you think we'll live like this?

657
00:54:51.189 --> 00:54:53.189
One day, when you meet Boon Yi,

658
00:54:53.829 --> 00:54:55.229
make her some clothes.

659
00:54:55.530 --> 00:54:57.459
Can people really be born again?

660
00:54:58.970 --> 00:55:00.599
People who lived a great life...

661
00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:02.999
or a very wicked life...

662
00:55:03.539 --> 00:55:04.910
probably don't.

663
00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:07.039
But...

664
00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:09.240
those who left...

665
00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:11.249
with great sorrow and regret...

666
00:55:11.380 --> 00:55:12.579
may get...

667
00:55:13.079 --> 00:55:15.249
one more chance by fate.

668
00:55:16.249 --> 00:55:17.649
How do you know?

669
00:55:18.349 --> 00:55:19.619
If not, then never mind.

670
00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:22.260
I don't want to make any clothes.

671
00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:24.630
The only two things you are good at are...

672
00:55:24.789 --> 00:55:26.130
making yourself look pretty...

673
00:55:26.130 --> 00:55:28.130
and getting jealous.

674
00:55:28.329 --> 00:55:29.860
Make use of that.

675
00:55:31.130 --> 00:55:32.599
Let's go play mah-jong.

676
00:55:33.269 --> 00:55:34.499
Go study.

677
00:55:34.499 --> 00:55:36.939
It's just for today.

678
00:55:38.570 --> 00:55:39.709
Let's go.

679
00:55:46.510 --> 00:55:48.619
I don't know where you are,

680
00:55:51.149 --> 00:55:53.519
but atone for everything you did there,

681
00:55:56.619 --> 00:55:58.630
and never return.

682
00:56:02.530 --> 00:56:03.899
Baek Hee.

683
00:56:20.209 --> 00:56:21.450
Can you get some forks?

684
00:56:28.419 --> 00:56:31.530
Did you two hold a photo exhibit yesterday?

685
00:56:31.860 --> 00:56:33.530
I put them up. I'll take them down.

686
00:56:33.530 --> 00:56:35.059
They look great. Leave them up.

687
00:56:35.059 --> 00:56:36.399
Don't take them down.

688
00:56:36.559 --> 00:56:38.399
Are you going to the construction site later?

689
00:56:38.399 --> 00:56:39.869
Yes, after I stop by my office.

690
00:56:39.869 --> 00:56:42.140
Then can you drop me off at the subway station?

691
00:56:42.570 --> 00:56:43.869
It's the weekend. Do you want to come?

692
00:56:44.070 --> 00:56:45.070
Should I?

693
00:56:45.269 --> 00:56:46.640
I'll call you later.

694
00:56:47.369 --> 00:56:48.539
Do you want some milk?

695
00:57:29.419 --> 00:57:30.479
What was that?

696
00:57:31.619 --> 00:57:33.649
Are the lights changing just for you?

697
00:57:33.789 --> 00:57:34.789
What?

698
00:57:35.220 --> 00:57:36.990
I guess so.

699
00:58:05.619 --> 00:58:08.059
Sharon will be surprised to see this.

700
00:58:09.789 --> 00:58:11.059
I have a feeling...

701
00:58:11.430 --> 00:58:13.559
that she will come back in May.

702
00:58:15.130 --> 00:58:16.630
She likes roses.

703
00:58:23.499 --> 00:58:26.769
Who is it?

704
00:58:30.539 --> 00:58:31.849
Hae Ra.

705
00:58:35.180 --> 00:58:36.979
Goodness, you're so awful.

706
00:58:36.979 --> 00:58:38.490
I haven't seen you in ages.

707
00:58:38.950 --> 00:58:40.419
I'll visit from time to time.

708
00:58:41.660 --> 00:58:43.260
Everything looks the same.

709
00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:45.059
I'm going to leave it as it is...

710
00:58:45.229 --> 00:58:46.689
until Sharon returns.

711
00:58:46.789 --> 00:58:48.559
When will she come back?

712
00:58:48.899 --> 00:58:50.099
Baek Hee said...

713
00:58:50.459 --> 00:58:53.169
she'll be back in 30 or 50 years.

714
00:58:53.729 --> 00:58:54.740
But who knows?

715
00:58:57.039 --> 00:58:58.809
I came to return this.

716
00:59:03.939 --> 00:59:04.950
What?

717
00:59:14.450 --> 00:59:15.820
After I put this on,

718
00:59:16.390 --> 00:59:18.530
I went through a series of odd events.

719
00:59:21.630 --> 00:59:23.559
It was a turning point in my life.

720
00:59:23.899 --> 00:59:25.869
Anyway, I became happy.

721
00:59:25.999 --> 00:59:27.399
This is a very special coat,

722
00:59:27.939 --> 00:59:29.269
so I want to return it.

723
00:59:29.399 --> 00:59:30.470
Really?

724
00:59:31.269 --> 00:59:32.610
Did your life change...

725
00:59:32.740 --> 00:59:34.640
after you put this on?

726
00:59:34.910 --> 00:59:35.910
Yes.

727
00:59:39.780 --> 00:59:41.419
I'm thankful for the coat,

728
00:59:43.019 --> 00:59:44.649
but I'm also scared of it.

729
01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:30.760
Yes, dark brown.

730
01:00:31.499 --> 01:00:33.729
Seung Goo, I'm leaving.

731
01:00:34.570 --> 01:00:35.640
One second.

732
01:00:36.039 --> 01:00:37.499
Have a cup of tea before you leave.

733
01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:40.340
Then I'll tell Soo Ho to come here.

734
01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:41.910
We have to be somewhere later.

735
01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:43.539
That'd be wonderful.

736
01:00:44.550 --> 01:00:47.010
Yes. Hello? Yes.

737
01:01:11.169 --> 01:01:13.769
Who are you?

738
01:02:02.459 --> 01:02:04.760
(Black Knight)

739
01:02:04.890 --> 01:02:06.760
I think she's pretending not to know me.

740
01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:08.160
I came back very soon this time, right?

741
01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:09.300
You don't remember?

742
01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:10.760
The chic Sharon style.

743
01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:12.099
She's back.

744
01:02:12.099 --> 01:02:13.570
I'm marrying Soo Ho.

745
01:02:13.729 --> 01:02:15.470
My employees prepared this.

746
01:02:15.470 --> 01:02:16.740
How about champagne?

747
01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:19.769
Let's stop. Please!

748
01:02:19.970 --> 01:02:21.939
I'm a son of a criminal.

749
01:02:21.939 --> 01:02:23.910
Hae Ra said she'd work...

750
01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:26.010
in the office in Rome for two years.

751
01:02:26.010 --> 01:02:27.749
I don't want you to go.

752
01:02:27.749 --> 01:02:29.419
All I need is you.

753
01:02:29.780 --> 01:02:31.189
This isn't a dream, is it?
