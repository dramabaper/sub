00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:07.480
(Episode 14)

2
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.959
Cheers. Go on, and drink.

3
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.200
Who are you?

4
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.339
I am a detective.

5
00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:33.909
My gosh.

6
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.680
That's so annoying. Why are you killing our mood?

7
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.680
I'm sorry to be a killjoy,

8
00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.150
but I need to talk to Kim Hak Bum.

9
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.250
- So the party is over for the day. - Hey, mister.

10
00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.150
Sing us a song.

11
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.490
If you pass unanimously, we'll end the party then.

12
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.829
- What a great idea. - You're the best.

13
00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.299
I can't sing since I'm tone-deaf,

14
00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:58.559
but I'm good at threatening people.

15
00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:02.229
"According to Article 4 and 61 of Narcotic Control Regulation,"

16
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.900
"if you possess or use narcotic drugs,"

17
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.339
"you will serve a maximum of five years in prison..."

18
00:01:06.339 --> 00:01:09.210
"or pay a maximum of 50,000 dollars as a fine."

19
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.350
But this guy is the son of the prosecutor general.

20
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.880
What do you think? Do you think you can give us a pass this once?

21
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.020
- I forgot my wallet today. - My gosh.

22
00:01:21.089 --> 00:01:23.589
- Pay him, and send him home now. - How typical.

23
00:01:23.589 --> 00:01:25.619
- I can pay him. Let me do it. - Sure.

24
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.759
- What is it? - Let's do it.

25
00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.359
- Hey, jerk. - What are you doing?

26
00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:35.199
Darn it.

27
00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:38.240
My goodness. Didn't I tell you?

28
00:01:38.699 --> 00:01:40.969
I was warning earlier. Now,

29
00:01:41.809 --> 00:01:42.880
I'm threatening you.

30
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.109
"Prosecutor General Kim Moo Yeol's Son Is a Drug Offender."

31
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.550
If this goes viral tomorrow morning, it'd be fun to watch.

32
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:51.680
- Let's go. - He's so annoying.

33
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.350
- Okay. - Get out.

34
00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.150
Hurry, you jerk!

35
00:01:56.419 --> 00:01:57.589
Bye.

36
00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:24.879
You crazy jerks!

37
00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.460
Are you feeling okay now?

38
00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:42.170
You know Kim Byung Gi, right?

39
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.099
The dealer for foreign cars.

40
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.309
There's no way you don't know him.

41
00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:49.240
He's the one who confirmed your alibi.

42
00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:54.409
Hey, get a band in here. I am going to sing now.

43
00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:58.319
Hey! Get the band in here!

44
00:02:59.119 --> 00:03:02.089
- I'm going to sing. - We had a missing person report.

45
00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:05.319
I don't know. I do not know.

46
00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:08.529
Okay. Let's say that you don't know it for now.

47
00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.460
Mr. Kim Hak Bum,

48
00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.999
where were you on January 24?

49
00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:15.029
Hey.

50
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.240
You jerk. Warrant.

51
00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:20.240
Bring me a warrant!

52
00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:25.909
Mr. Kim.

53
00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:29.580
Let's not do this the hard way.

54
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.249
You can just tell me where he is.

55
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.020
If I go poke my head here and there, it wouldn't be good for you, right?

56
00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:45.059
I went to the gym...

57
00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:46.170
that day.

58
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.439
And I slept at home throughout the day.

59
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.599
I'm going to sing.

60
00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:53.670
Don't bother me.

61
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.480
Only good memories

62
00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.219
And a yearning heart

63
00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:08.520
Remain just like this

64
00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.890
On the road you took

65
00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:18.200
Hey! Why isn't the band here yet?

66
00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:22.570
Kim Hak Bum. January 24.

67
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.070
Yes, there's a record that he was here.

68
00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:28.739
(Member List, Kim Hak Bum)

69
00:04:29.609 --> 00:04:33.109
But couldn't someone else use his gym card?

70
00:04:33.109 --> 00:04:34.710
It's impossible since it's a fingerprint scan.

71
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.380
- Is that so? - Besides, I saw him myself...

72
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.849
on January 24.

73
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.390
Do you remember dates for every member here?

74
00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:45.120
He wanted me to call a taxi for him.

75
00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.159
Mr. Kim is famous for driving high-end cars.

76
00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:50.400
I just found it unusual.

77
00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.270
Then can you give me the taxi's plate number...

78
00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.469
or the number of the taxi service you called?

79
00:04:56.839 --> 00:05:01.039
(Youngil Transportation)

80
00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.279
I'm sorry to interrupt you from working.

81
00:05:11.049 --> 00:05:12.479
So you're a detective?

82
00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.890
Yes. Your help would go a long way.

83
00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:17.690
You said January 24, right?

84
00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.060
It was around 3pm in front of Culture Fitness.

85
00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.929
Yes, I remember. He was a long-distance customer.

86
00:05:24.359 --> 00:05:27.900
(Speculated date of Kim Byung Gi's disappearance)

87
00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:31.169
Our country has a lot of great places too.

88
00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.239
After we arrived at the destination,

89
00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:36.380
You're not even on your way here?

90
00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:37.909
What do you want me to do?

91
00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:39.239
He was talking to someone on the phone.

92
00:05:39.239 --> 00:05:40.880
He asked why his friend wasn't on his way and got upset.

93
00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.650
Shoot. Darn him!

94
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.219
And then he waited for an hour before getting off my taxi.

95
00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:49.349
I waited in the car with him for an hour.

96
00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:51.589
I remember that because he paid me generously...

97
00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:53.359
for the waiting time...

98
00:05:53.359 --> 00:05:55.560
and the time it took for me to return to Seoul.

99
00:05:56.359 --> 00:05:57.900
Where was your destination?

100
00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:06.810
Hey, did you look into it?

101
00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:09.810
Yes, there was a construction for the bridge on January 23.

102
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:11.539
- Is that so? - The fissure was quite serious,

103
00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:13.950
so they paved it again with asphalt. Let's go check it out.

104
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:15.279
Okay. Let's go.

105
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.239
Dong Bae.

106
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:03.330
What do you think this is?

107
00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.099
Isn't that a bloodstain?

108
00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:08.270
- Bring me the luminol. - Okay.

109
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:09.570
(Luminol glows when applied on blood.)

110
00:07:44.599 --> 00:07:48.070
Dong Bae, what do you think this is?

111
00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:53.349
(Kim Byung Gi Disappearance Case)

112
00:07:53.349 --> 00:07:55.250
(A car dealer, confirmed Kim Hak Bum's alibi)

113
00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:56.279
(Gone missing on January 24, 2018)

114
00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.940
Tomorrow is our first trial.

115
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:25.109
Are you ready?

116
00:08:25.109 --> 00:08:26.150
I'm not sure.

117
00:08:26.849 --> 00:08:27.880
Well...

118
00:08:28.849 --> 00:08:31.349
I'm not sure if that's something I can be ready for.

119
00:08:32.449 --> 00:08:34.850
I am more competent...

120
00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:37.260
than you think.

121
00:08:41.689 --> 00:08:43.230
Here's the thing about the law.

122
00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:47.230
The result changes depending on one's ability...

123
00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.770
to use the law to one's advantage instead of the ability...

124
00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:52.370
to get closer to the truth.

125
00:08:54.409 --> 00:08:55.970
I'm sure you know that better than anyone.

126
00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.579
What do you mean by that?

127
00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:04.020
Don't people with money forge laws that doesn't even exist?

128
00:09:35.179 --> 00:09:36.350
It's Kang In Ho.

129
00:09:36.449 --> 00:09:37.449
It's him.

130
00:09:37.449 --> 00:09:38.779
He's over there.

131
00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:40.049
- It's Kang In Ho. - It's Kang In Ho.

132
00:09:41.949 --> 00:09:43.760
It's him.

133
00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.459
The eldest son of T Group, Mr. K, who is convicted of murder,

134
00:09:46.459 --> 00:09:49.860
will be attending the first trial at the Seoul Central District Court.

135
00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.459
Stand back. Please stand back.

136
00:09:51.459 --> 00:09:52.970
Please say something.

137
00:09:54.069 --> 00:09:57.539
He admits having a serious brawl on the day of her disappearance.

138
00:09:57.539 --> 00:10:01.169
But they went to their hideout, the penthouse, as usual,

139
00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:03.439
had sexual intercourse, and parted ways.

140
00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:05.079
It's the same as the evidence suggests.

141
00:10:05.709 --> 00:10:07.650
We got the footage of the accused and the victim...

142
00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:08.650
going inside the penthouse,

143
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:12.079
which is supposedly where the murder took place.

144
00:10:12.449 --> 00:10:15.120
However, we couldn't find the footage of the victim leaving.

145
00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:18.459
It's a typical locked-room murder case.

146
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:24.959
The hallways and emergency stairs of that building...

147
00:10:24.959 --> 00:10:27.230
all have no surveillance cameras.

148
00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:28.970
Let me suggest a possible scenario.

149
00:10:29.199 --> 00:10:30.470
If the victim...

150
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:32.199
went through the hallway and took the emergency stairs...

151
00:10:32.199 --> 00:10:34.970
on the day of the incident...

152
00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:36.380
It's an incorrect assumption.

153
00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:39.340
She could've taken the stairs,

154
00:10:39.909 --> 00:10:42.350
but there are cameras at the entrance of the building.

155
00:10:42.679 --> 00:10:44.919
There's no way she could've gone out without getting caught.

156
00:10:44.919 --> 00:10:46.350
What if she didn't go outside?

157
00:10:48.049 --> 00:10:49.720
What if she went to another flat?

158
00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.189
Another flat?

159
00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:58.630
What if another resident from Stellarium Villa...

160
00:10:58.959 --> 00:11:02.600
went to the victim?

161
00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:05.370
I will submit a video footage...

162
00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:09.110
that will back up my claim.

163
00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:11.209
That evidence has not been approved.

164
00:11:11.809 --> 00:11:13.750
We just got it now,

165
00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:17.049
so please understand that we couldn't get the approval earlier.

166
00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:22.959
(The victim gets off at the 4th floor, the penthouse.)

167
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.529
(On the same day, the victim gets on the elevator from the 3rd floor.)

168
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.970
Before the victim and the accused went to the penthouse,

169
00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:39.569
they had a serious brawl.

170
00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:41.309
And then they made love.

171
00:11:41.939 --> 00:11:43.909
Have you never been in love, sir?

172
00:11:46.279 --> 00:11:49.750
Couples fight aggressively, but they make up soon after.

173
00:11:50.079 --> 00:11:51.880
It's not the most common case.

174
00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:54.289
But it's something...

175
00:11:54.419 --> 00:11:57.689
that can happen between two people in love.

176
00:12:00.559 --> 00:12:02.630
Like that the prosecution claimed,

177
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.360
the accused didn't have the motivation...

178
00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:09.100
strong enough to murder the victim...

179
00:12:09.439 --> 00:12:11.340
and to watch her fade away.

180
00:12:11.669 --> 00:12:14.169
Then how about this?

181
00:12:15.709 --> 00:12:16.980
What if she laid with him...

182
00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:18.939
not out of her own will...

183
00:12:20.279 --> 00:12:21.850
but by force?

184
00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:28.549
What is it now?

185
00:12:29.659 --> 00:12:30.720
(1 year ago)

186
00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.860
- Mom! - Mom!

187
00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:34.130
Why are you avoiding me?

188
00:12:34.529 --> 00:12:36.199
- I wasn't avoiding you. I was busy. - Right.

189
00:12:38.329 --> 00:12:39.329
I see.

190
00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:42.939
Oh, right.

191
00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:45.970
Did you have a good time with your family...

192
00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.240
at Club Med Cancun?

193
00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:53.909
You must have nothing to say.

194
00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:58.319
Mi Jung.

195
00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:00.590
No. It's fine.

196
00:13:00.949 --> 00:13:02.789
You're a good father and a good husband.

197
00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:05.520
That's part of your job.

198
00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:13.029
She's so pretty and adorable.

199
00:13:13.329 --> 00:13:14.929
I completely understand you.

200
00:13:15.529 --> 00:13:16.600
What do you mean?

201
00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:20.809
I'm talking about your daughter.

202
00:13:21.439 --> 00:13:24.510
I've seen your wife at the wedding,

203
00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:29.049
but it's my first time to see your daughter...

204
00:13:31.579 --> 00:13:32.579
in person.

205
00:13:32.579 --> 00:13:33.850
Where are you now?

206
00:13:34.819 --> 00:13:35.850
I am...

207
00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:38.260
where...

208
00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:40.659
your wife and daughter is.

209
00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:53.110
Excuse me.

210
00:13:54.069 --> 00:13:55.069
Hello?

211
00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:07.020
What is it?

212
00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:10.020
Did she tell you...

213
00:14:11.459 --> 00:14:13.459
that she was at the kindergarten?

214
00:14:13.459 --> 00:14:14.529
What are you doing?

215
00:14:15.189 --> 00:14:16.199
Why?

216
00:14:17.059 --> 00:14:18.559
Why did only my baby have to die?

217
00:14:19.159 --> 00:14:20.970
It's unfair!

218
00:14:24.669 --> 00:14:26.669
Please Mi Jung.

219
00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:28.709
Calm down first.

220
00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:32.480
It's not my fault that something went wrong with the baby.

221
00:14:32.909 --> 00:14:35.179
You told me to abort my baby.

222
00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:38.850
The baby...

223
00:14:39.279 --> 00:14:41.449
must've heard your spiteful words!

224
00:14:41.919 --> 00:14:44.689
That's why the baby couldn't go on!

225
00:14:47.829 --> 00:14:50.360
Stop being impossible.

226
00:14:54.384 --> 00:14:59.384
<font color="#fcc89b">[VIU Ver] E14 Return "I Refuse to Answer"</font>
<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

227
00:15:04.779 --> 00:15:05.779
(Trial Being Held)

228
00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:09.720
- You treated Mi Jung at the OBGYN? - Yes.

229
00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:13.949
Will you tell us about Mi Jung's condition at that time?

230
00:15:13.949 --> 00:15:16.419
She couldn't get pregnant anymore.

231
00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:20.360
She got her left ovary taken out eight years ago.

232
00:15:20.459 --> 00:15:22.959
Mi Jung was desperate to have a child.

233
00:15:23.459 --> 00:15:26.429
A year and half ago, she miraculously got pregnant.

234
00:15:26.799 --> 00:15:28.770
Was it when she was 22 weeks in?

235
00:15:29.069 --> 00:15:31.240
She started discharging blood and got rushed to the ER.

236
00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:35.840
During the surgery, her right ovary became bad too.

237
00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:39.980
She had been in a brawl, so I called the police.

238
00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:44.020
There were signs of abuse, but she insisted she wasn't abused.

239
00:15:44.579 --> 00:15:45.850
She said she fell down the stairs.

240
00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:49.459
The assailant can't be punished...

241
00:15:49.689 --> 00:15:51.419
if the victim denies the assault charge.

242
00:15:52.159 --> 00:15:55.559
And we can't take the investigation further in that case.

243
00:15:56.929 --> 00:15:58.100
Let's make an assumption.

244
00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:00.230
If the injury was...

245
00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:03.400
indeed from the brawl she had with the accused,

246
00:16:03.699 --> 00:16:06.939
and if she lost her child because of it,

247
00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:11.610
she, who couldn't have another child, would've lost her mind.

248
00:16:12.279 --> 00:16:14.610
And she would've threatened his family.

249
00:16:20.049 --> 00:16:21.120
Wouldn't that have been...

250
00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:24.090
a strong enough motivation to commit murder?

251
00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:27.459
Your Honor, the prosecution's claim is merely an assumption.

252
00:16:27.459 --> 00:16:29.090
There's no evidence to back up his claim.

253
00:16:31.059 --> 00:16:32.059
Is that it?

254
00:16:35.569 --> 00:16:37.100
I am asking...

255
00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:40.069
if In Ho was really involved...

256
00:16:40.069 --> 00:16:41.740
in Mi Jung's miscarriage.

257
00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:45.640
You must've wanted to kill her. Right?

258
00:16:46.579 --> 00:16:48.449
She threatened your daughter's security,

259
00:16:48.449 --> 00:16:50.850
and she threatened to expose your relationship.

260
00:16:51.319 --> 00:16:52.520
She must've pressured you. Right?

261
00:16:54.289 --> 00:16:57.819
I would've wanted to kill her hundred times over. Don't you agree?

262
00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:00.659
You're right.

263
00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:03.199
I wanted to kill her.

264
00:17:04.459 --> 00:17:05.959
That's what you want to hear, isn't it?

265
00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:11.199
She called me all the time.

266
00:17:11.669 --> 00:17:12.669
When I didn't answer her call,

267
00:17:13.269 --> 00:17:16.580
she threatened that she would go to Na Ra.

268
00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:20.209
I truly...

269
00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:23.249
wanted to kill her.

270
00:17:25.219 --> 00:17:26.249
But...

271
00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:28.550
you don't actually kill a person...

272
00:17:29.659 --> 00:17:31.860
because you want to.

273
00:17:33.929 --> 00:17:34.989
Haven't you been...

274
00:17:35.689 --> 00:17:37.759
in a situation...

275
00:17:37.759 --> 00:17:40.330
where you really wanted to kill someone?

276
00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:42.070
It was...

277
00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:44.870
only a thought for me too.

278
00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:52.310
You see, honesty is only useful...

279
00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:56.009
when someone actually believes you.

280
00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:57.820
This means...

281
00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:01.650
we are on a losing side.

282
00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:23.739
I found it. I found it. I found it.

283
00:18:27.449 --> 00:18:28.479
We found it.

284
00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:35.090
An hour after Byung Gi's car passed,

285
00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:38.419
a very familiar-looking taxi passed the same route.

286
00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:40.290
Should I bring in Kim Hak Bum?

287
00:18:43.459 --> 00:18:44.459
Go get him.

288
00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:54.070
Ms. Geum.

289
00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:55.570
Will you get a grip?

290
00:18:55.769 --> 00:18:56.880
Is the case over?

291
00:18:57.739 --> 00:18:58.780
I am sorry.

292
00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:02.179
When you went to the penthouse, you saw a regular phone, right?

293
00:19:02.919 --> 00:19:05.519
Well, yes. I remember seeing it.

294
00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:08.719
First, meet In Ho...

295
00:19:08.719 --> 00:19:11.189
and check if there is a regular phone at the penthouse.

296
00:19:11.259 --> 00:19:13.530
If there is, get a call history.

297
00:19:13.989 --> 00:19:15.030
Okay.

298
00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:20.729
(Young Man Store)

299
00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:43.320
Hello? Excuse me.

300
00:19:46.759 --> 00:19:48.159
Do you need something?

301
00:19:48.959 --> 00:19:49.959
Yes.

302
00:19:54.199 --> 00:19:55.400
This.

303
00:19:58.969 --> 00:20:00.570
I'll take this too.

304
00:20:05.509 --> 00:20:09.650
Actually, I have a question, ma'am.

305
00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:14.120
Do you know someone named Kim Jung Soo...

306
00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:17.159
who used to live in this area a long time ago?

307
00:20:23.429 --> 00:20:24.929
You're the one who came by my house the other day, right?

308
00:20:25.499 --> 00:20:26.570
Please take a seat.

309
00:20:29.199 --> 00:20:30.439
What is this about?

310
00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:33.169
- Dr. Kim Jung Soo. - Yes?

311
00:20:33.769 --> 00:20:35.370
You know Yum Mi Jung, right?

312
00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:36.509
Yum Mi Jung?

313
00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:40.509
Well, I'm not sure. Yum Mi Jung...

314
00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:43.080
I don't know anyone by that name.

315
00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:44.919
I don't remember anyone named that.

316
00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:58.429
Then the wine bar in Cheongdam-dong...

317
00:20:58.429 --> 00:20:59.499
Excuse me.

318
00:21:01.269 --> 00:21:03.570
My gosh, I can't ever take a breather, you know?

319
00:21:04.269 --> 00:21:05.570
My goodness.

320
00:21:06.169 --> 00:21:08.370
I'm sorry, but this is an urgent call.

321
00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:12.679
I'm sorry that I couldn't be of any help again today.

322
00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:16.550
- Please excuse me. - Sure.

323
00:21:17.179 --> 00:21:18.320
Goodbye.

324
00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:29.330
This is a locked-room murder case.

325
00:21:29.759 --> 00:21:32.459
The defendant and the victim entered...

326
00:21:32.459 --> 00:21:34.300
the penthouse at the same time.

327
00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:36.840
And within an hour,

328
00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:39.570
the defendant came out of the penthouse alone.

329
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:41.540
You may continue.

330
00:21:42.669 --> 00:21:46.880
Then at that time, the victim must have been there alone...

331
00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:48.979
if she wasn't already dead.

332
00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:53.620
Please check the call record I have submitted as evidence.

333
00:21:58.959 --> 00:22:01.530
This is the list of calls made through the landline...

334
00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:03.330
installed in the penthouse.

335
00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:05.030
On the day of the incident,

336
00:22:05.199 --> 00:22:09.229
there's a record that a call was made at 1:59am.

337
00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:12.810
Surprisingly, it was made 30 minutes later than the time...

338
00:22:13.169 --> 00:22:15.840
the defendant was seen in the surveillance cameras...

339
00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:17.840
of the penthouse entrance and elevator.

340
00:22:21.479 --> 00:22:25.620
It must mean that the victim was alive by that time.

341
00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:26.719
Then...

342
00:22:27.919 --> 00:22:30.560
whom did she call?

343
00:22:30.759 --> 00:22:32.560
He's the witness in the next trial...

344
00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:35.590
and the prime suspect of this case.

345
00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:39.360
I would like to request...

346
00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:42.070
Mr. Kim Jung Soo, the neurosurgeon of Daemyung Hospital, as a witness.

347
00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:52.810
(January, 2018)

348
00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:57.150
(February 5, 2018, Court Day)

349
00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:26.580
Swear in the witness.

350
00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:27.979
"I solemnly swear..."

351
00:23:27.979 --> 00:23:31.419
"that I'll tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth."

352
00:23:31.419 --> 00:23:34.419
"If I commit perjury, I swear that I will face the punishment."

353
00:23:34.419 --> 00:23:35.949
"Witness, Kim Jung Soo".

354
00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:41.459
Counsel, you may question the witness.

355
00:23:41.659 --> 00:23:42.689
Thank you, Your Honor.

356
00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:48.370
(Witness)

357
00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:52.040
Do you know the victim, Yum Mi Jung?

358
00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:53.370
Yes, I do.

359
00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:55.810
When my colleague visited you,

360
00:23:56.409 --> 00:23:58.739
you claimed you didn't know her. Am I correct?

361
00:23:58.939 --> 00:24:00.780
At that time, I didn't know her.

362
00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:03.219
It was only two weeks ago. You didn't know her then,

363
00:24:03.219 --> 00:24:04.679
but you claim you know her now.

364
00:24:05.249 --> 00:24:07.189
Could you please elaborate?

365
00:24:07.449 --> 00:24:09.120
I was a regular customer...

366
00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:11.419
at a wine bar Yum Mi Jung ran.

367
00:24:11.759 --> 00:24:14.330
She went by Rachel at the bar.

368
00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:16.860
Only recently, I found out that her real name...

369
00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:18.759
is Yum Mi Jung.

370
00:24:18.759 --> 00:24:21.870
On the day the victim was murdered,

371
00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:23.199
which was the 27th,

372
00:24:23.199 --> 00:24:24.540
where were you?

373
00:24:24.739 --> 00:24:25.739
I was at home.

374
00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:31.409
Again, your answer seems to have changed.

375
00:24:31.409 --> 00:24:32.709
I was mistaken.

376
00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:36.219
A few weeks ago, someone paid me a visit.

377
00:24:36.919 --> 00:24:41.650
She asked me about the 27th, more specifically, the dawn of the 28th.

378
00:24:41.989 --> 00:24:43.919
That day, I was on a night shift.

379
00:24:43.919 --> 00:24:46.130
My colleague asked me to switch our shift.

380
00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:48.530
I reckon that must be why I made such mistake.

381
00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:51.499
I found it strange to see her continuing to visit me,

382
00:24:51.499 --> 00:24:53.070
so I looked into what happened.

383
00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:56.870
Then I found out such a horrendous act had been done to Rachel.

384
00:24:58.070 --> 00:25:00.709
Around that time, I went to the wine bar...

385
00:25:00.709 --> 00:25:02.509
to mourn for her death.

386
00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:06.080
I couldn't go inside because I was deeply sad.

387
00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:10.780
You were the last person to have talked with her.

388
00:25:11.249 --> 00:25:13.019
Yes, I was made aware of that.

389
00:25:13.249 --> 00:25:16.019
Did you meet the victim that day?

390
00:25:16.019 --> 00:25:17.090
No.

391
00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:21.630
I finished the call after listening to her for 20 minutes.

392
00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:23.159
(Speculated day of Yum Mi Jung's death)

393
00:25:23.159 --> 00:25:25.499
To be honest, her call was quite bothersome.

394
00:25:26.169 --> 00:25:28.630
When she called, I was exhausted.

395
00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:31.969
On top of that, I had 2 or 3 glasses of wine.

396
00:25:32.469 --> 00:25:34.040
It was a bother.

397
00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:39.749
Can you tell us about what you talked about on the phone?

398
00:25:39.749 --> 00:25:41.350
It was nothing special.

399
00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:44.219
She had a fight with her lover.

400
00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:45.850
They made up soon after.

401
00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:51.519
To tell you the truth, I only listened to her as she vented.

402
00:25:51.919 --> 00:25:54.689
I don't remember what we talked about. That's how much...

403
00:25:54.689 --> 00:25:57.159
I was neither motivated nor willing to listen to the conversation.

404
00:25:57.159 --> 00:26:00.030
So that breaks my heart.

405
00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:01.929
Let me change the subject.

406
00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:05.040
You work at Daemyung Hospital, correct?

407
00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:06.140
Yes.

408
00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:09.009
The hospital hired you as a special program for the recipient...

409
00:26:09.209 --> 00:26:11.179
of Daemyung Scholarship Foundation.

410
00:26:11.409 --> 00:26:13.380
That's not relevant to the case, Your Honor.

411
00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:14.810
It is relevant, Your Honor.

412
00:26:15.810 --> 00:26:18.979
This may provide a motive for the murder.

413
00:26:18.979 --> 00:26:20.550
You may continue.

414
00:26:22.189 --> 00:26:24.689
- Am I correct? - Yes.

415
00:26:24.919 --> 00:26:29.530
Tell us the requirements to win the scholarship from the hospital.

416
00:26:35.969 --> 00:26:37.499
A candidate must enter 1 of top 10 universities in Seoul,

417
00:26:37.969 --> 00:26:39.870
have top two percent academic records,

418
00:26:40.169 --> 00:26:41.810
and be either freshman or sophomore.

419
00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:44.640
Since the recipient will be hired...

420
00:26:44.909 --> 00:26:47.479
by the hospital,

421
00:26:47.909 --> 00:26:51.479
the hospital went through a thorough screening of the candidates.

422
00:26:52.179 --> 00:26:54.150
Could you explain about yourself...

423
00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:57.890
when you received the scholarship?

424
00:26:58.719 --> 00:27:01.890
I was in my fourth year of medical school.

425
00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:04.360
I was attending a university outside of Seoul.

426
00:27:04.459 --> 00:27:08.669
When I looked into it, your grades were in upper-middle percentile.

427
00:27:08.999 --> 00:27:10.499
According to his acquaintances,

428
00:27:10.499 --> 00:27:12.040
due to financial reasons,

429
00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:14.709
he repeatedly took semesters off.

430
00:27:14.709 --> 00:27:15.870
Is that correct?

431
00:27:17.209 --> 00:27:18.209
Yes.

432
00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:22.350
How did you win the scholarship if you weren't qualified?

433
00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:29.919
I refuse to answer.

434
00:27:29.919 --> 00:27:32.120
- Then should I answer it? - No.

435
00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:37.800
You have a sister, don't you?

436
00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:42.030
Stop it.

437
00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:50.340
- 10 years ago, your sister... - Darn it.

438
00:27:51.739 --> 00:27:53.679
- What is that behavior? - What do you think you're doing?

439
00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:58.120
- Shut your mouth. - What's happening?

440
00:28:01.019 --> 00:28:02.320
Let go. Let go of me!

441
00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:07.890
10 years ago, do you remember the case...

442
00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:09.560
where your sister...

443
00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:11.600
was raped by a Mr. K of a school foundation...

444
00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:13.929
and a Mr. S of a major hospital,

445
00:28:13.929 --> 00:28:16.570
which name is a household name?

446
00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:19.969
Shut your mouth. I told you to stop. Stop it!

447
00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:23.409
Hey, stop it. Stop!

448
00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:41.360
(Return)

449
00:28:41.459 --> 00:28:43.060
What if Kim Jung Soo is the real killer?

450
00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:44.699
That means he knows everything we had done.

451
00:28:44.699 --> 00:28:45.759
Is that why you killed her?

452
00:28:45.759 --> 00:28:48.130
If I were to kill someone, it'd have been Kim Hak Bum or Seo Joon Hee.

453
00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:49.939
Joon, we're here.

454
00:28:49.939 --> 00:28:52.400
Joon, we are friends.

455
00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.009
Is it not going your way?

456
00:28:54.009 --> 00:28:56.239
Why did you hide something like that?

457
00:28:56.239 --> 00:28:57.340
Why did you do it?

458
00:28:57.340 --> 00:29:00.479
Because of her big mouth, my sister has become a crazy woman.

459
00:29:00.479 --> 00:29:04.249
Even if the real killer of your case is related to this?

460
00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:06.919
That's why you should start looking for it now.
