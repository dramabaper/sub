2
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.110
Je-hee, try this too. It looks good.

3
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.210
I guess food really needs salt.

4
00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.800
It's incredible that your restaurant
hasn't shut down.

5
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.630
That's tree bark. Not food.

6
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.180
Ski resorts are opening soon.

7
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.640
-Want to go skiing?
-You know how to ski?

8
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.180
Of course. What can't I do?

9
00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.520
I'm good at everything but baseball.

10
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.070
I need to use the bathroom.

11
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.780
Where's the restroom?

12
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.610
Walk straight, and you'll see it.

13
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.160
-It's a little far.
-Okay.

14
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.450
I'll go with you.

15
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.250
Look, I'm not a child.

16
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.040
Plus, it's light out. I'm fine.

17
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.790
It's inside a large cafe. It's safe.

18
00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:01.960
CHARGES MADE

19
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.670
Chef Je-hee Kim's negligence
resulted in the Complainant's injury.

20
00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.940
It's supposed to be first snowfall,
but it's raining instead.

21
00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.560
It looks like it'll pour soon.

22
00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.480
If it rains, let's drink coffee
by the Han River.

23
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.070
Sure. Let's do everything you want to do.

24
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.240
Je-hee, is everything okay?

25
00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:34.870
With me?

26
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.620
Yes.

27
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.960
Why?

28
00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.620
Nothing. I'm just asking.

29
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:45.540
But...

30
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.970
can we go snowboarding instead?
Do you know how to snowboard?

31
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.680
Je-hee.

32
00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.560
I told you, there's nothing I cannot do.

33
00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.940
Seriously...

34
00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.650
You're good at bragging too.

35
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.190
Why are you not annoying
even when you're being conceited?

36
00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:09.740
That's...

37
00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.410
It tastes good.

38
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.080
SEOBU PENITENTIARY

39
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.580
You won't run into him
if you don't work in the greenhouse,

40
00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.210
so hang in there for two months.

41
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.920
Don't tell the warden about this.
I feel bad asking.

42
00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.840
He already knows.

43
00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.760
He freaked out, saying he'd send
Chief Yeom back to Daegu,

44
00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.140
so I said to excuse you
from your labor assignment.

45
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.230
People started saying
you get preferential treatment.

46
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.060
If reporters get a whiff,
it'll only hurt you.

47
00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:50.900
It's crap!

48
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.360
You have two and a half months left.
Let's avoid crap.

49
00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.910
Aren't they announcing the decision
on Min-chul's parole today?

50
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.660
That's right. It's today.

51
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.040
-He should get it, right?
-Of course.

52
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.090
I looked at his file,
and he didn't cause trouble once.

53
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:10.920
He has the maximum merit points too.

54
00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.720
He never even cursed at a guard.

55
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.350
Wow. How could he live like that
for over 20 years?

56
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.560
He's the only person in this prison

57
00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.770
who admits his crime and regrets it.

58
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.270
Exactly. He has to get out.

59
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.980
He came in 1995,
so how many years has it been?

60
00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.950
The warden should know by now. Let's go.

61
00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.920
How can you read the Bible right now?

62
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.700
You may get out of here
before I do at this rate.

63
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.330
I have an entire week left,

64
00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.620
but you may get out in three days,
if you are approved.

65
00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.580
That's a good thing.
Are you actually jealous?

66
00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.090
When was I jealous?

67
00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.380
I'm just saying.

68
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:40.180
God... Everything I do
annoys you, doesn't it?

69
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.560
Yeah. You realize that now?

70
00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:45.810
Let's fight.

71
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:51.480
He's coming.

72
00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.320
Min-chul, I can't wait either.

73
00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.660
Everyone's in the warden's office.
Let's go.

74
00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.750
WARDEN'S OFFICE

75
00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.760
Will they announce
the result on the phone?

76
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.800
They send a written notice,
but they call the high-profile ones first.

77
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:25.720
Min-chul is famous,
so they'll probably call first.

78
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.680
They should've decided by now.

79
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.190
Right. He can't wait in his cell.

80
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:36.230
Hiya!

81
00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:00.510
Huh?

82
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:03.550
What's the good word?

83
00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:05.140
It was approved, right?

84
00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:15.230
It wasn't.

85
00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:20.150
Excuse me?

86
00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:22.030
That's absurd.

87
00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:28.290
How could Min-chul be rejected?
How could that happen?

88
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:30.790
We should follow the rules!

89
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:32.250
We did follow the rules.

90
00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.960
We submitted the request by the rules,

91
00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:41.470
and about 10 to 20% of the applications
get rejected.

92
00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:44.090
Damn it...

93
00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:48.220
He was rejected because he was unlucky.
Don't complain here.

94
00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.020
Lieutenant Paeng.

95
00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:56.270
Please, stay within your boundaries, okay?

96
00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:02.240
I know you want to get out
as soon as possible, but what can we do?

97
00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:04.950
We were only notified.

98
00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:09.450
Still, the Christmas special pardon
is coming up too.

99
00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.160
There are more opportunities.

100
00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:14.540
You'll get it for sure next time.
I'm sure.

101
00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:18.670
I'm so upset. My insides feel crushed.

102
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.130
I feel bad now.

103
00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:24.130
Sorry.

104
00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:28.600
-Let's go eat.
-What the fuck? "Sorry"?

105
00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:35.270
He's been waiting every second
of every day for this day.

106
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:36.230
What? "Sorry"?

107
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:40.070
How could you say "Sorry," so lightly

108
00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:42.650
to someone who's been waiting
for this day for 22 years?

109
00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:45.610
Right.

110
00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:49.160
Is this like you stepping
on someone's foot in the street?

111
00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.290
It's like you bumping
someone's shoulder, right?

112
00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:52.830
Sure, it's nothing.

113
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:55.620
It's just a minor occurrence before lunch.

114
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.080
Just a "Sorry," like you're giving alms!

115
00:08:58.170 --> 00:08:59.540
That will do, right?

116
00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:02.550
Lieutenant. That's enough.

117
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:04.840
If you continue, you're done for.

118
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.090
Shit!

119
00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:14.980
Let's go eat.

120
00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.110
Damn it.

121
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:23.940
Hey.

122
00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.490
Come in for some coffee.

123
00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:36.710
I'll take him back.

124
00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:41.460
Goodness...

125
00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:46.380
Come on.

126
00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:06.900
PRISON PLAYBOOK

127
00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.660
Have some. You haven't eaten all day.

128
00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.880
Where did Lieutenant Paeng Go?
His noodles will get cold.

129
00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:38.060
I want to know why.

130
00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.770
I'd like to officially ask the higher ups
for the reason.

131
00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:44.270
Wait for now.

132
00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.280
He served more than 80% of his sentence.

133
00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:50.070
He never caused trouble for 22 years.
How could he be rejected for parole?

134
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:52.360
There must've been a mistake.

135
00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:55.950
If you know someone up above, please ask.

136
00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:58.750
If not, I'll submit a request
for an explanation.

137
00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:02.750
I need to explain properly to Min-chul

138
00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:05.090
-why he was rejected.
-I said to wait!

139
00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:07.340
Why won't you fucking listen to me?

140
00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:08.920
Why I ought to...

141
00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:15.350
I thought it was strange
that Min-chul was rejected too,

142
00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:16.970
so I asked around.

143
00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:22.190
I know he's the most reformed
among all the crooks here,

144
00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:24.150
and that he's a good man.

145
00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:26.400
I know that, okay?

146
00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.440
Whatever. I don't care.

147
00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.740
What did they say? Why? What's the reason?

148
00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:36.910
They probably saved him
for the Christmas special pardon.

149
00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:41.210
They'll announce the Christmas
special pardon prisoners soon.

150
00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:43.370
They say if he wasn't selected this time,

151
00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:46.000
he'll most likely be
a Christmas special pardon.

152
00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:53.050
-Are you crying?
-Are you insane?

153
00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.470
You need to speak nicely.

154
00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.810
Please, you bastard.

155
00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:03.520
Seriously...

156
00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:05.060
Anyway,

157
00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:08.520
tell him not to be too disappointed
and to wait,

158
00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:10.150
and that there will be good news.

159
00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:12.990
What if he doesn't get it again?

160
00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:15.410
We can't do that to him again.

161
00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:17.620
I won't tell him.

162
00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.040
That's right.

163
00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:23.460
Let's not tell him. Let's not.

164
00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:27.330
If he doesn't get it again,
how would we face him?

165
00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:30.920
Goodness...

166
00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:11.550
It's okay.

167
00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:13.590
I'm fine.

168
00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:17.800
You should sleep.
You didn't sleep at all last night.

169
00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.140
Sure.

170
00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:38.740
Really?

171
00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:41.330
Are you sure he's a candidate?
You are sure?

172
00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:45.830
That's what the warden heard.
We have to wait for the announcement.

173
00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:49.630
The Ministry of Justice
announces special pardons.

174
00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:52.920
All we have are rumors until then.

175
00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:56.800
Anyway, you can't tell Min-chul, okay?

176
00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:00.010
Let's not break his heart twice.

177
00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:05.220
Is Captain Na a psychopath? I heard he
nonchalantly said, "Sorry," to Min-chul.

178
00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:08.060
That's why I can't keep from cursing
when I see him.

179
00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:10.100
I can't refrain from cursing.

180
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:12.230
You curse at everyone else too.

181
00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:14.400
They make me curse.

182
00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.740
Do we not curse because we don't want to?

183
00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:20.070
You'll get screwed one day
because of your cursing.

184
00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:24.530
You think you can be
a refined corrections officer

185
00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:27.080
who doesn't curse
for the rest of your life, right?

186
00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:31.580
Give it a few more years. Let's talk then.

187
00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:33.420
I curse too, when I have to.

188
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.460
But I don't call everyone a "bastard"
like you do.

189
00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:39.590
Exactly.
Let's talk after a few more years.

190
00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:43.430
Hey.

191
00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:46.010
Is this a plastic model?

192
00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:49.520
Yes. Why did you try to eat it?
I got it to look at.

193
00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.520
Why did you get noodles to look at?

194
00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:58.860
Maybe Captain Na has a past
that we don't know about.

195
00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:02.320
Otherwise, how could a person
have no empathy whatsoever?

196
00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:05.030
There must be something. Right?

197
00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:08.620
No, he doesn't.
He's just not that type of person.

198
00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:16.340
HYEONG-SU NA

199
00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.760
CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS' CREED

200
00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:33.480
-Straighten your tie.
-Yes, sir.

201
00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:38.030
A lanyard should be worn around your neck.

202
00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:39.320
Yes, sir.

203
00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:58.840
HYEONG-SU NA

204
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:10.430
It's so cold.

205
00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:30.580
-So cold.
-Shoot.

206
00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:51.060
PERSONAL EFFECTS

207
00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:54.140
HAN-YANG YOO

208
00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:12.410
SEOBU PENITENTIARY

209
00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:23.670
It's your last visitation.
You have three days left, right?

210
00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:26.880
-Yeah, I have three days left.
-You must be happy.

211
00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:33.270
I'll visit often. Don't get yourself
in trouble before then, okay?

212
00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:36.520
You worry me the most here.

213
00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.940
You're the biggest ticking time bomb.

214
00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:42.070
Je-hyeok, that man...

215
00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:44.280
Is he a lunatic?

216
00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:49.070
No. He is someone
who accumulates beatings.

217
00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:53.870
Han-yang's visitation is canceled.

218
00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:56.450
Plus, ten days in the hole
for insulting a guard.

219
00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:00.500
-Quiet. Don't jinx me.
-Too late.

220
00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:03.500
You bastard.
Let's see if you can get out...

221
00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:07.670
I'll tack on 1,800 years to your sentence.

222
00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:11.220
What? 1,800 years? Watch what you say.
Watch it, you bastard.

223
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:14.850
"You bastard"? Why you bastard...

224
00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:20.020
Oh my god.
He broke my arm. God, this hurts.

225
00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:23.020
Help me. He's trying to kill me.

226
00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:25.360
Lieutenant Paeng is killing me.

227
00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:26.400
Help me.

228
00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:29.610
Give it a rest.

229
00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:32.700
What's taking you so long?
Ji-won is waiting.

230
00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:35.160
Bang!

231
00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:47.590
Min-chul.

232
00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:52.180
-Are you okay?
-Of course, I'm okay.

233
00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:54.930
I forgot it already.

234
00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:59.680
I was out of line. I should be grateful
just for the fact

235
00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:02.020
that I'm still alive and well.

236
00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:06.440
I was being too greedy for a moment.

237
00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:07.610
I'm sorry.

238
00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:11.490
I've lived here for 22 years.

239
00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:14.660
I'm sure the remaining three years
will fly by.

240
00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:15.990
I'm fine.

241
00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:20.460
Having you curse on my behalf

242
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.460
is good enough for me.

243
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:25.840
Thank you, sir.

244
00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:30.170
You know...

245
00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:35.140
Never mind.

246
00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:42.690
Great!

247
00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:52.860
-Play dumb.
-Of course.

248
00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:54.860
He'd be hurt again.

249
00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:57.990
I really hope he gets it.

250
00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:59.620
They'll announce it soon.

251
00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:04.870
You haven't seen Chief Yeom, right?

252
00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:08.790
You haven't seen Chief Yeom, right?

253
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:10.800
I have no reason to.

254
00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:14.880
I don't go for my labor assignment,
and all I do is train.

255
00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:19.060
He's a real snake.
You really need to be careful, okay?

256
00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.980
I'm sure he's looking for a way
to make money.

257
00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:27.230
He's always been obsessed with money.

258
00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:29.730
That's right, he's obsessed with money.

259
00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:33.610
I'm sure he's busy looking for an inmate
who's rich and a sucker.

260
00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:38.660
Me?

261
00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:42.200
I have no money.

262
00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:47.080
I'll be careful.

263
00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:56.840
Hey, Sang-jae.

264
00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.930
Funny seeing you here.

265
00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:03.680
Hello, sir.

266
00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:16.110
Druggies are good
at bringing in financiers.

267
00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:19.120
But they're sloppy
in carrying out the plan.

268
00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.870
Still, now that they're gone,

269
00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:25.870
my source of income is gone.

270
00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:28.580
Sang-jae.

271
00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.630
Show what you can do.

272
00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:37.720
You still have gambling debt, right?

273
00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:40.550
That was so long ago.

274
00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:43.640
I have less than 100 million won left.

275
00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:46.350
How about Je-hyeok Kim?

276
00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:53.820
Shall we go after him
and squeeze 300 million won from him?

277
00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:00.320
To him, 300 million won is chump change.

278
00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:05.330
He's such a loose cannon
he may bite you if you piss him off.

279
00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:16.090
You need to plan it well.

280
00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:19.130
That's all.

281
00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:30.600
Where's Je-hyeok Kim?

282
00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:32.770
Why? You want his autograph?

283
00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:35.900
Yes. I'm a fan.

284
00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:38.440
Je-hyeok Kim

285
00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:40.950
is my favorite player.

286
00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:46.160
Gosh. I feel sorry for you.
He doesn't work here anymore.

287
00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:49.290
I hear he'll focus on the training
in the greenhouse training facility.

288
00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:53.540
"Greenhouse training facility"?

289
00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:55.290
Yes, greenhouse training facility.

290
00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:58.010
You didn't know?

291
00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:00.470
He has a personal training facility.

292
00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:05.010
The warden made it for him.
It's pretty nice.

293
00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:08.100
He has almost every exercise equipment
he needs there.

294
00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:10.100
I see.

295
00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:23.660
Wait at the <i>budae jjigae</i> restaurant.

296
00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:28.540
Who says I'm coming?
I'll be waiting at home.

297
00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:29.660
Hey.

298
00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:32.330
Don't laugh.

299
00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:36.750
You're so mean, playing with my emotions.

300
00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:41.050
I don't want you to see me

301
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:43.260
walking out of prison.

302
00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:47.350
My dad too. So, let's meet
at the <i>budae jjigae</i> restaurant.

303
00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:50.020
My dad will go there too.

304
00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:54.690
-What about your mother?
-She won't come.

305
00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:58.440
Even when her mother passed away,
she went to the restaurant.

306
00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:00.320
She'll never come.

307
00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:06.740
You're really done with drugs, right?

308
00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:08.950
Can't you tell?

309
00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:10.950
I'm really done.

310
00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:12.870
Trust me.

311
00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:18.340
Say, "Yes." Go on.

312
00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:23.470
Yes, I trust you.

313
00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:31.890
I'll give you a present.

314
00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:35.850
I'll give it to you when you get out.

315
00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:38.860
What is it? What's the present?

316
00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:41.360
What? What is it? Tell me.

317
00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:42.900
I'll give it to you when you get out.

318
00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:45.780
Give it to me now. I want it now.

319
00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:49.160
What is it? What's the present?
What could it be?

320
00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:51.830
-What is it?
<i>-Visitation over.</i>

321
00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:54.540
<i>-Please exit for the next visitation.</i>
-Hey.

322
00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:56.540
I'm leaving. See you on the outside.

323
00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:58.830
Hey. Be quiet.

324
00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:02.130
Ji-won! What's the present?

325
00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:06.300
Tell me! I'll die!
I'll die from curiosity!

326
00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:09.930
Ji-won!

327
00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:11.760
Ji-won!

328
00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:14.310
Hey, Ji-won!

329
00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:16.480
-What? What is it? Okay.
-Ji-won.

330
00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:18.560
-No, no. He'll be back.
-Let go.

331
00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:20.270
Yes, yes. He'll be back.

332
00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:26.150
-Ji-won!
-Why are you so heavy?

333
00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:29.990
Is it very cold out, ma'am?

334
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:31.490
The weather is the same.

335
00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:34.250
You know the weather from there.
It's the same.

336
00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:37.160
No, ma'am.
It's different. It is very different.

337
00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:41.960
Even if it is the same "outside,"
it is colder in here.

338
00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:45.170
That is how prison is, ma'am.

339
00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:49.890
I said to stop being so formal.

340
00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:53.060
Stop being so formal.

341
00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:56.020
Or I won't come anymore.

342
00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:02.480
It's very difficult for me.

343
00:26:05.610 --> 00:26:06.490
I'll try.

344
00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:09.150
I'll try...

345
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:11.200
I'll try, ma'am.

346
00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:16.200
Fine. I'll do that.

347
00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.090
Anyway,

348
00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:28.470
why me?

349
00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:36.520
There are several other inmates here
who were here for many years.

350
00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:41.650
Why did you want to interview me?

351
00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:45.980
Do you...

352
00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:48.690
know me?

353
00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:54.240
No. How would I know you?

354
00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:20.850
Are you...

355
00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:27.320
by any chance...

356
00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:32.530
my daughter?

357
00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:36.620
You're...

358
00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:41.370
my daughter,

359
00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:48.340
aren't you?

360
00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:56.850
Yes.

361
00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:00.720
I'm your daughter.

362
00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:18.490
How...

363
00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.410
How...

364
00:28:24.290 --> 00:28:27.080
How could this... How...

365
00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:29.710
How could this be?

366
00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:44.270
WINTER 1995

367
00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:45.350
Weren't they expensive?

368
00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:47.150
They're counterfeit.

369
00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:49.570
Then I'll take them.

370
00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:55.200
-Okay.
-That's right. I have something to say.

371
00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:02.750
What is it?

372
00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:11.750
No. Later. I'll tell you tonight.

373
00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:13.340
Have a nice day.

374
00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:15.130
You're so silly.

375
00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:18.010
Wait. I really have something to say.

376
00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:23.470
What? What is it? The sun is going to set.

377
00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:28.100
I love you.

378
00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:32.070
You brat. That's stupid... I'm leaving.

379
00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:34.360
Lock up.

380
00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:36.490
Okay. Bye.

381
00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:37.610
Bye.

382
00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:06.810
You bastard!

383
00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:07.770
Die!

384
00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:20.280
CERTIFIED FAMILY RECORDS

385
00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:23.530
<i>Number 11, please proceed to Window 5.</i>

386
00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:26.370
Two copies of my family record, please.

387
00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:30.330
I guess you got a scholarship.

388
00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:32.000
How did you know?

389
00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:35.210
Three national scholarship recipients
came before you.

390
00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:38.090
I see. The school requested it.

391
00:30:39.050 --> 00:30:42.180
Why else would someone your age
need your family record?

392
00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:50.480
Here. That'll be 2,000 won.

393
00:30:50.770 --> 00:30:51.730
Thank you.

394
00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:01.150
<i>Mom.</i>

395
00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:03.120
FATHER: MIN-CHUL KIM

396
00:31:03.370 --> 00:31:05.200
<i>You said Dad was in heaven.</i>

397
00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:08.750
<i>I'll tell you everything in person.</i>

398
00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:11.210
<i>I'll go to Seoul tomorrow morning.</i>

399
00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:14.250
No, Mom. Tell me now. Tell me.

400
00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:20.920
<i>I hear he's at Seobu Penitentiary.</i>

401
00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:23.430
<i>He's in prison.</i>

402
00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:26.140
<i>Just pretend he doesn't exist.</i>

403
00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:30.060
<i>Nothing has changed.</i>

404
00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:34.060
<i>You and I can live happily on our own
as we have been.</i>

405
00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:36.650
<i>I'm sorry</i>

406
00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:41.150
<i>I couldn't tell you all this time.</i>

407
00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:48.950
<i>Your dad committed a huge crime,</i>

408
00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:51.710
<i>but I don't hate him.</i>

409
00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:53.330
<i>He was a good person.</i>

410
00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:57.590
<i>He was incredibly good to me,</i>

411
00:31:58.130 --> 00:32:00.210
<i>and I liked him a lot.</i>

412
00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:06.260
<i>So, you are our precious child
that your mom and dad</i>

413
00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:10.430
<i>were blessed with out of love. Understand?</i>

414
00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:13.230
Hello? Is this Seobu Penitentiary?

415
00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:16.770
WAITING ROOM FOR VISITATION

416
00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:25.070
Hello.

417
00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:33.580
Hello.

418
00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:35.330
Not that either.

419
00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:44.170
Hi.

420
00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:52.680
Min-chul Kim's visitor.

421
00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:54.730
Come in.

422
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:56.140
Okay.

423
00:32:58.730 --> 00:32:59.940
<i>You're going?</i>

424
00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:03.610
<i>Goodness. Don't do it.</i>

425
00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:05.650
<i>Don't.</i>

426
00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:08.620
<i>He'll be shocked.</i>

427
00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:10.370
<i>Don't do it.</i>

428
00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:13.160
<i>I want to see him for myself.</i>

429
00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:14.870
<i>My dad.</i>

430
00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:19.250
<i>I want to check for myself whether or not</i>

431
00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:21.750
<i>he's a good person.</i>

432
00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:34.310
WING 6A HELPER

433
00:33:34.770 --> 00:33:36.310
He uses

434
00:33:36.810 --> 00:33:39.980
an entire greenhouse in the prison
as a personal training facility?

435
00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:43.480
Yeah, that's preferential treatment.

436
00:33:45.030 --> 00:33:46.110
Nice.

437
00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:47.950
TRAINING

438
00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:54.240
I'll meet secretly with Je-hyeok Kim.

439
00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:58.750
How? He has a lot of gnats surround him.

440
00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:02.460
That's what an errand boy is for.

441
00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:04.760
I'll take care of it.

442
00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:08.010
Also,

443
00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:11.510
I may really go public with this,

444
00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:14.180
so please prepare a reporter
that you can control.

445
00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:20.810
An easy reporter who will write,
"Despicable Star Je-hyeok Kim,

446
00:34:21.690 --> 00:34:24.480
Who Abuses His Fame."

447
00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:46.460
Hey. Can I catch one?

448
00:34:47.050 --> 00:34:49.050
Seeing you, I feel like I can do it too.

449
00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:06.320
Four, three, two, one.

450
00:35:09.570 --> 00:35:11.570
I think I broke a finger!

451
00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:14.320
Hey! How do you catch these?
Doesn't it hurt?

452
00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:17.200
It doesn't hurt.

453
00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:23.710
You cyborg bastard.

454
00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:27.050
Jailbird, scram! Je-hyeok is waiting.

455
00:35:27.130 --> 00:35:28.510
Yes, sir.

456
00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:42.020
He should be able to make a comeback
sooner than expected.

457
00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:45.560
I really think
he'll reach mid-140s easily.

458
00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:47.150
I don't want much.

459
00:35:47.650 --> 00:35:50.780
I want him to take the mound
at least once.

460
00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:57.990
Shouldn't he take a break?

461
00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:02.620
He may wear out his right shoulder
before he gets to use it properly.

462
00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.960
Shoot. What do I say?

463
00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:09.710
Hey. You try to stop him.

464
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:12.380
Je-hyeok, when is Ji-ho coming to visit?

465
00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:14.130
Is she not coming?

466
00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:15.970
Why isn't she coming?

467
00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:40.660
His Achilles heel is his girlfriend
right now.

468
00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:45.620
My Achilles heel is also my girlfriend.

469
00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:49.000
When should I tell him?

470
00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:08.810
Aren't you eating? You should eat today.

471
00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:11.520
Okay.

472
00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:27.040
Slow down.

473
00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:35.800
Thanks.

474
00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:54.530
Looks like the drugs
finally left your system.

475
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:56.530
You got fit too.

476
00:37:56.610 --> 00:38:00.450
It's because of the IV.
Drugs work quickly on me.

477
00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:05.120
If you take drugs one more time
and come back here,

478
00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:07.250
I may really kill you.

479
00:38:07.330 --> 00:38:10.540
Why would I come back?
I really quit doing drugs.

480
00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:13.670
He's being polite.
I guess he's back to his senses.

481
00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:19.050
Anyway, aren't you going to throw me
a farewell party?

482
00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:21.220
Do I just leave like this?

483
00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:24.350
A fare well party, my ass.
Like you did anything good.

484
00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:26.390
What is there to celebrate?

485
00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:28.480
What?

486
00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:33.860
Oh, right. Where did it go?

487
00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:39.400
Why you...

488
00:38:42.450 --> 00:38:43.370
Hey!

489
00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:46.490
Hey. Open up.

490
00:38:47.330 --> 00:38:48.200
Open up, you shit!

491
00:38:48.290 --> 00:38:51.080
Are you nuts? Would you open it?
I will not, you bastard.

492
00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:02.470
I guess this is the last time
we'll see that.

493
00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:06.220
I hope Han-yang will be okay
on the outside.

494
00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:12.560
He will be.

495
00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:14.860
He's normal if he doesn't take drugs.

496
00:39:15.690 --> 00:39:16.650
You're right.

497
00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:19.240
As long as

498
00:39:19.530 --> 00:39:22.740
he doesn't take drugs,
he's normal and a good kid.

499
00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:24.410
I'm not that easy.

500
00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:28.240
Drugs. That's the problem.

501
00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:31.290
It isn't that easy to quit.

502
00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:33.540
Not at all.

503
00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:57.730
GENUINE REFORM, BRIGHT FUTURE

504
00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:09.870
Hello.

505
00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:12.160
Hi, Ji-won. You came early.

506
00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:15.380
-Yes. Please, have a seat.
-Okay.

507
00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:17.960
Did you take a cab?

508
00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:20.420
No. I came in my wife's car.

509
00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:27.640
Honey, over here.

510
00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:29.100
Han-yang is going to faint.

511
00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:34.230
Hello.

512
00:40:34.310 --> 00:40:37.650
You poor thing. You couldn't even sleep
because of your loser friend.

513
00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:42.490
That asshole. Wait until he gets out.

514
00:40:43.070 --> 00:40:45.110
I'll slap him silly with tofu.

515
00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:48.950
It's a way to express her love.
It's a bit much, right?

516
00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:52.080
My life sucks. It sucks.

517
00:41:03.090 --> 00:41:03.920

Please congratulate us.

521
00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:22.400
We will raise him well
to be a good person.

522
00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:08.860
Go on.

523
00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:30.840
I know I said not to wait here,
but still...

524
00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:32.850
They really didn't.

525
00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:36.850
They listen so well.

OCTOBER 27TH
FRIDAY 5:10 A.M.

527
00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:00.330
What's taking him so long?

528
00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:03.500
He needs to say bye to the guards,

529
00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:06.380
and there's a process,
so it may be taking a while.

530
00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:08.880
He'll be here soon. Don't worry.

531
00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:33.700
Hi.

532
00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:56.550
Here.

533
00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:29.960
You son of a bitch.

534
00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:51.030
Shit.

535
00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:22.720
Han-yang Yoo. Police.

536
00:45:22.810 --> 00:45:25.940
You're under arrest for the use
and possession of illegal drugs.

537
00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:28.350
You have the right to remain silent.

538
00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:30.520
You have the right to an attorney.

539
00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:32.230
Let's go.

540
00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:56.420
Good work.

00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:45.700
How can I hold any tighter?

552
00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:47.160
Lose some weight!

553
00:47:49.950 --> 00:47:50.870
What?

554
00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:53.540
Are you pissed off again?

555
00:47:54.210 --> 00:47:56.630
You get pissed off so easily lately.

556
00:47:57.880 --> 00:47:59.260
I'm not. Forget it.

557
00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:02.220
I'll just ask Je-hyeok to do it later.

558
00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:03.840
He's busy.

559
00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:08.470
I'm sorry. I really am.
I'll do it. Come here.

560
00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:13.600
Come on, don't be like that.

561
00:48:14.310 --> 00:48:15.690
Stop it. I mean it.

562
00:48:16.610 --> 00:48:18.610
I'm really pissed off, okay?

563
00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:23.860
Min-chul, visitor.

564
00:48:24.490 --> 00:48:25.490
She comes every day.

565
00:48:27.450 --> 00:48:28.410
Okay.

566
00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:29.910
Let's go.

567
00:48:44.590 --> 00:48:46.800
Nice, Boss. Nice!

568
00:48:54.770 --> 00:48:57.360
What is it? How dare you come here?

569
00:49:01.650 --> 00:49:03.280
Je-hyeok Kim.

570
00:49:04.450 --> 00:49:06.450
The warden wants to see you.

571
00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:55.870
As expected, you aren't intimidated.

572
00:49:58.670 --> 00:50:00.540
I knew I'd see you eventually.

573
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:03.960
What do you want?

574
00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:07.220
A lot.

575
00:50:08.930 --> 00:50:10.090
I want a lot...

576
00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:12.640
from you.

577
00:50:14.770 --> 00:50:16.430
You're getting out soon, right?

578
00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:20.600
You signed with Nexen and everything.

579
00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:22.940
You must be in a good mood,

580
00:50:25.110 --> 00:50:27.280
but I want to kill that mood a little.

581
00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:33.700
A reporter close to me
keeps asking for a present,

582
00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:35.490
so I want to give him one.

583
00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:45.500
"Superstar Je-hyeok Kim Receives
Special Treatment in Prison.

584
00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:50.090
He uses a greenhouse alone
as a personal training facility.

585
00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:53.010
The guards also give Je-hyeok Kim
preferential treatment."

586
00:50:53.100 --> 00:50:54.510
You know, this is...

587
00:50:57.100 --> 00:50:58.180
So?

588
00:50:59.190 --> 00:51:00.350
What do you want?

589
00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:02.100
What else?

590
00:51:04.110 --> 00:51:05.270
Money.

591
00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:08.360
I want 300 million won.

592
00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:12.570
What? That's nothing to you.

593
00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:17.830
This is my account number.

594
00:51:19.830 --> 00:51:21.040
Deposit it this week.

595
00:51:23.170 --> 00:51:25.710
Otherwise, Nexen will be in a pickle.

596
00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:28.130
The player they signed
will have a crappy rep.

597
00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:33.640
Hey!

598
00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:57.660
Boss.

599
00:51:58.660 --> 00:52:00.660
-Yes?
-I put the blanket down. You should sleep.

600
00:52:01.250 --> 00:52:02.120
Sure.

601
00:52:03.170 --> 00:52:05.290
-Thanks.
-Not at all.

602
00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:09.170
Also, I put some money
into your commissary account.

603
00:52:10.970 --> 00:52:12.420
It's the pay for being my catcher.

604
00:52:13.130 --> 00:52:14.390
I'll give you more next month.

605
00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:19.100
Thanks for your hard work.

606
00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:31.320
Jung-woo.

607
00:52:32.110 --> 00:52:34.950
You haven't heard back from them
regarding the retrial, right?

608
00:52:36.030 --> 00:52:37.410
We have to wait a lot more.

609
00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:40.330
They say it usually takes
at least three months.

610
00:52:40.410 --> 00:52:43.330
My gosh. Why does it take so long?

611
00:52:44.790 --> 00:52:48.210
If you're granted a retrial, is it over?

612
00:52:48.630 --> 00:52:50.050
Can you get out?

613
00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:52.300
No.

614
00:52:53.050 --> 00:52:55.260
It just means the petition is granted.

615
00:52:55.890 --> 00:52:58.550
The actual trial comes afterward.

616
00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:00.260
It's never-ending.

617
00:53:00.970 --> 00:53:02.270
It never ends.

618
00:53:02.930 --> 00:53:06.060
But if my petition for retrial is granted,

619
00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:09.360
it means I'll likely win the retrial.

620
00:53:10.570 --> 00:53:12.280
-I see.
-With a retrial,

621
00:53:12.740 --> 00:53:14.450
it's more important
that the court grants it

622
00:53:14.530 --> 00:53:17.200
and agrees with the reason
for the retrial,

623
00:53:17.490 --> 00:53:20.660
rather than the actual retrial itself.

624
00:53:21.330 --> 00:53:25.160
Of course, the likelihood of getting
the retrial granted...

625
00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:28.000
is less than five percent.

626
00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:34.260
Don't worry, Jung-woo.

627
00:53:35.590 --> 00:53:36.590
You'll get it.

628
00:53:37.890 --> 00:53:40.760
If you don't get it,
what's the use of laws in this country?

629
00:53:41.350 --> 00:53:42.810
I know I shouldn't get my hopes up,

630
00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:45.430
but I can't sleep
whenever I think about it.

631
00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:03.620
The Truth Behind The Demon Captain's Case

632
00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:06.370
The Three Soldiers Confess
Sergeant Oh Killed Private Park

633
00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:11.210
The tone has changed overnight.
It's now "The Demon Sergeant Oh."

634
00:54:11.290 --> 00:54:14.630
People are cursing him out.
"Asshole Sergeant Oh." "Killer Sergeant."

635
00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:18.970
The world opened its eyes to the truth.
It feels so good.

636
00:54:19.050 --> 00:54:22.050
Yes. I wondered
why there has been nothing in the news.

637
00:54:22.390 --> 00:54:25.270
This is great.
This should've been in the papers sooner.

638
00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:34.270
The Three Soldiers Confess
Sergeant Oh Killed Private Park

639
00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:35.690
Jung-woo must be shocked.

640
00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:38.150
I was going to tell him today
during the visit.

641
00:54:39.490 --> 00:54:40.660
The article beat me.

642
00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:43.740
A paper must've published it
in case they miss out on the scoop.

643
00:54:43.830 --> 00:54:46.040
It's not bad. The comments are positive.

644
00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:47.830
Maybe we should've leaked it sooner.

645
00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:51.170
No. This is the perfect timing.
You did well.

646
00:54:51.250 --> 00:54:55.380
We have to do anything and everything
that may help us get the retrial.

647
00:54:57.920 --> 00:55:02.550
Anyway, I wonder where Sergeant Oh is.
I heard he quit his job.

648
00:55:03.260 --> 00:55:06.520
I can't believe someone like that
entered a large corporation

649
00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:09.980
and was working there.
I just can't believe it.

650
00:55:12.020 --> 00:55:14.020
He's living in a hotel in Gangwon.

651
00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:16.780
He's in a penthouse there.

652
00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:19.900
He's doing just fine.

653
00:55:20.990 --> 00:55:22.200
How do you know that?

654
00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:24.570
Because I've been tracking that shit.

655
00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:30.120
Whether or not we get the retrial,

656
00:55:30.210 --> 00:55:33.540
whether or not we win the trial,
I want to beat the crap out of him

657
00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:36.130
at least once.

658
00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:38.630
We'll follow the law.

659
00:55:39.260 --> 00:55:40.970
We'll do everything by the law,

660
00:55:42.220 --> 00:55:43.970
but before I send him to jail,

661
00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:47.140
I want to punch him at least once.

662
00:55:50.430 --> 00:55:52.350
Otherwise, I'll lose my mind.

663
00:55:54.190 --> 00:55:57.730
Thank you. I feel like
I've gotten much healthier.

664
00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:01.320
What do you mean, "feel"?
I'm sure you did get healthier.

665
00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:07.740
I'm glad she has a boyfriend.

666
00:56:08.490 --> 00:56:10.660
She has someone to comfort her
during difficult times.

667
00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:14.460
That guy is such a jerk.

668
00:56:15.130 --> 00:56:17.500
She said the hot stone pot was hot,

669
00:56:17.590 --> 00:56:21.380
but he touched it and pressed charges
because he got burned.

670
00:56:23.180 --> 00:56:25.550
Chef Je-hee was really stressed out,
wasn't she?

671
00:56:26.850 --> 00:56:29.260
She even went
to the police station recently.

672
00:56:30.180 --> 00:56:31.100
When?

673
00:56:32.060 --> 00:56:36.440
You know the day it was supposed to be
the first snowfall, but it rained instead.

674
00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:41.740
You must feel so much better,

675
00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:44.450
since he dropped the charges today.
You heard, right?

676
00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:46.160
Yes.

677
00:56:50.910 --> 00:56:52.830
I'll see you tomorrow.

678
00:56:52.910 --> 00:56:55.040
Okay. Thank you for your hard work.

679
00:56:56.040 --> 00:56:57.580
-Thank you.
-Sure.

680
00:56:57.670 --> 00:56:58.790
Bye.

681
00:57:05.090 --> 00:57:06.470
It's warm.

682
00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:11.180
I hugged it all the way here
to give it to you.

683
00:57:18.190 --> 00:57:19.190
What the heck?

684
00:57:19.820 --> 00:57:21.780
I was there when you took it
out of the warmer.

685
00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:24.280
I was at the convenience store too.

686
00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:26.400
Oh, really?

687
00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:35.410
-Joon-ho.
-Yes?

688
00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:38.130
I did something.

689
00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:40.840
What? What did you do?

690
00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:49.510
I want to go to Gwangju

691
00:57:50.260 --> 00:57:52.680
and open a small restaurant in my name.

692
00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:58.100
That single-table restaurant
has always been my dream.

693
00:57:58.730 --> 00:58:00.980
The real estate broker called today.

694
00:58:01.150 --> 00:58:04.190
There's a place I looked at,
and they're selling it at a cheap price.

695
00:58:06.190 --> 00:58:07.610
That's great.

696
00:58:08.610 --> 00:58:12.370
You should feel honored.
I didn't even tell my mom.

697
00:58:12.450 --> 00:58:15.450
You're the first person I told.

698
00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:23.170
But Je-hee,

699
00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:27.380
will you tell me only the good stuff

700
00:58:27.970 --> 00:58:30.220
and not tell me the bad stuff?

701
00:58:32.220 --> 00:58:36.310
I heard a customer pressed charges
and you even went to the police station.

702
00:58:40.350 --> 00:58:42.400
Why don't you tell me things like that?

703
00:58:43.570 --> 00:58:45.570
I can suffer alone.

704
00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:49.490
I don't need to make you suffer too.

705
00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:54.410
Hey. I'll worry about myself.
Why are you worrying about me?

706
00:58:55.410 --> 00:58:57.660
I didn't know you were having
such a hard day,

707
00:58:57.790 --> 00:59:01.830
and babbled about going skiing,
and how good the risotto was.

708
00:59:02.420 --> 00:59:04.090
You must've been hurting so much.

709
00:59:05.590 --> 00:59:07.960
Why are you making an idiot
out of your boyfriend?

710
00:59:10.590 --> 00:59:11.590
Je-hee.

711
00:59:14.890 --> 00:59:16.890
From now on, tell me about unhappy,

712
00:59:18.020 --> 00:59:19.390
difficult things too.

713
00:59:21.350 --> 00:59:24.810
Of course, it'll worry me.
Yes, I'll be very angry

714
00:59:25.650 --> 00:59:28.990
and very concerned
if something like that happens to you.

715
00:59:30.780 --> 00:59:32.200
But still, I want to know.

716
00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:34.450
I should know.

717
00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:36.700
It's your life.

718
00:59:40.540 --> 00:59:41.410
Okay?

719
00:59:42.420 --> 00:59:43.290
Okay.

720
00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:46.670
What a good girl.

721
00:59:52.510 --> 00:59:53.720
You know,

722
00:59:55.510 --> 00:59:58.720
even when you scold someone,
you're so sweet about it.

723
00:59:59.220 --> 01:00:00.060
What?

724
01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:01.980
You are so sweet.

725
01:00:02.690 --> 01:00:04.230
I was wrong.

726
01:00:06.060 --> 01:00:07.820
But since you said it like that,

727
01:00:10.610 --> 01:00:12.030
I'm not upset at all.

728
01:00:14.610 --> 01:00:17.490
That must be why you're my dream guy.

729
01:00:18.830 --> 01:00:19.660
God...

730
01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:22.660
I'm a good judge of character.

731
01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:23.830
Right.

732
01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:28.170
I won't let you go.

733
01:00:32.010 --> 01:00:33.880
I'm so shameless.

734
01:00:58.700 --> 01:00:59.910
Can I kiss you?

735
01:02:18.530 --> 01:02:20.280
Time is ticking.

736
01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:22.450
I heard you lost the scholarship.

737
01:02:22.530 --> 01:02:24.240
Not that. Say something else.

738
01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:30.790
I missed you.

739
01:02:40.470 --> 01:02:41.760
You're wearing the ring again.

740
01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:44.680
Of course. You gave it to me.

741
01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:48.940
I didn't get the scholarship
when we got these rings too.

742
01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:50.270
I was too distracted dating.

743
01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:59.400
FALL 2015

744

<i>MIRACULOUS HAND MASSAGES</i>

745
01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:09.830
Does it feel good?

746
01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:13.170
I don't feel anything.

747
01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:15.170
You did it hard, right?

748
01:03:16.670 --> 01:03:18.420
I'll do it for you. Turn around.

749
01:03:27.430 --> 01:03:28.600
That feels so good.

750
01:03:29.850 --> 01:03:30.940
Incredible.

751
01:03:35.650 --> 01:03:36.690
Hand.

752
01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:50.040
Never take it off, okay?

753
01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:00.550
Where's yours?

754
01:04:01.970 --> 01:04:03.050
Tada.

755
01:04:15.810 --> 01:04:16.980
I'll never take it off.

756
01:04:17.730 --> 01:04:20.190
How can a pitcher wear a ring
all the time?

757
01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:21.990
Wear it only when you see me, okay?

758
01:04:22.610 --> 01:04:23.610
Okay.

759
01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:27.660
Isn't it your exam period?
You have to study, right?

760
01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:30.750
No, I don't have to study.
I can just wing it.

761
01:04:30.830 --> 01:04:32.660
Should we go watch a movie?

762
01:04:33.410 --> 01:04:34.420
-Sure.
-No.

763
01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:36.580
-Let's drink.
-Sure.

764
01:04:37.790 --> 01:04:40.920
Don't say "sure" to everything.
You may have to pitch tomorrow.

765
01:04:41.550 --> 01:04:42.800
You're right.

766
01:04:44.050 --> 01:04:46.300
You say "sure" to everything.

767
01:04:46.390 --> 01:04:48.260
You're so soulless.

768
01:04:48.810 --> 01:04:50.310
It's not that I'm soulless,

769
01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:53.480
I just like everything.

770
01:04:55.810 --> 01:04:57.060
I really like both.

771
01:04:58.110 --> 01:05:00.530
As long as I'm with you, everything...

772
01:05:00.610 --> 01:05:01.440
That's enough.

01:05:01.530 --> 01:05:03.030
-The world...
-That's enough.

774
01:05:03.110 --> 01:05:04.610
It's because I really...

775
01:05:05.610 --> 01:05:08.200
You're making me cringe like crazy.
Stop it.

776
01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:09.530
No, no. Don't talk.

777
01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:11.740
-In the whole world...
-Stop it.

778
01:05:11.830 --> 01:05:13.960
-I adore...
-Stop it!

779
01:05:16.540 --> 01:05:18.960
What a pretty name. Eun-su Kim.

780
01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:22.920
Mom says it's the name
she wanted to change her name to.

781
01:05:23.970 --> 01:05:26.380
You know my mom's name, right?

782
01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:29.970
Mi-suk Jeong.

783
01:05:32.810 --> 01:05:35.600
It couldn't have been easy to come see me.

784
01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:38.900
I'm a murderer,

785
01:05:39.810 --> 01:05:40.980
and I'm in prison.

786
01:05:43.650 --> 01:05:44.780
It must've been scary.

787
01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:47.910
Mom said you were a good person.

788
01:05:50.030 --> 01:05:52.910
You went to prison before I was even born,

789
01:05:52.990 --> 01:05:54.830
but she said you were a good person.

790
01:05:56.540 --> 01:06:00.000
I thought maybe she still liked you
or something.

791
01:06:03.550 --> 01:06:05.720
I wanted to see for myself
what you were like.

792
01:06:08.590 --> 01:06:09.760
After meeting you,

793
01:06:10.890 --> 01:06:12.220
I see she was right.

794
01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:17.230
Thanks.

come back tomorrow, right?

799
01:06:34.790 --> 01:06:37.500
Of course. I'll see you tomorrow,

What am I supposed to do
about this big sin?

You knew, didn't you?

811
01:07:42.770 --> 01:07:43.900
It's so that...

812
01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:47.730
I'd repent much more, isn't it?

813

Now,

814
01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:00.960
I don't resent or hate anyone
or anything anymore.

815
01:08:04.330 --> 01:08:08.670
All I have left
are things to be thankful for.

816
01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:11.840
Lord,

817
01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:19.350
thank you so much for giving me
an angelic daughter.

818
01:08:23.940 --> 01:08:25.270
I killed a man...

819
01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:33.700
and didn't know...

820
01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:42.370
I didn't even know
that my daughter was born.

821
01:08:45.420 --> 01:08:46.960
Thank you so much...

822
01:08:48.750 --> 01:08:50.380
for sending me

823
01:08:51.550 --> 01:08:52.920
an angelic...

824
01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:55.760
an angelic daughter who calls me Dad.

825
01:08:56.890 --> 01:08:58.300
Thank you so much.

826
01:09:01.890 --> 01:09:03.020
There's nothing more...

827
01:09:04.850 --> 01:09:06.480
that I could possibly want.

828
01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:14.320
Please let me see my daughter often...

829
01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:19.580
If you'd let me...

830
01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:24.160
see my daughter often,

831
01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:29.920
I can live in jail
for the rest of my life.

832
01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:32.880
I don't care.

833
01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:38.010
Please, Lord.

834
01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:47.100
<i>Why were you praying for so long
in the church? God's busy.</i>

835
01:09:50.270 --> 01:09:51.820
I was thanking God.

836
01:09:55.820 --> 01:09:59.120
I said I received all the blessings
in this world,

837
01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:04.580
and that I don't care
if I rot in jail for the rest of my life,

838
01:10:05.620 --> 01:10:09.710
and I thanked God like crazy.
That's what I was praying about.

839
01:10:09.790 --> 01:10:10.630
Sorry,

840
01:10:11.670 --> 01:10:14.630
God won't be able to grant you your wish.

841
01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:18.970
Min-chul.

842
01:10:20.220 --> 01:10:22.260
You're getting out
by a Christmas special pardon.

843
01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:27.640
You're getting...

844
01:10:29.310 --> 01:10:31.020
a Christmas special pardon.

845
01:10:49.460 --> 01:10:50.500
Sorry?

846
01:10:53.130 --> 01:10:54.340
Say that again?

847
01:10:55.300 --> 01:10:56.550
Min-chul

848
01:10:57.510 --> 01:11:00.090
is getting out
by a Christmas special pardon.

849
01:11:01.140 --> 01:11:06.470
Min-chul was selected
for the Christmas special pardon!

850
01:11:17.490 --> 01:11:18.820
Me! Me too!

851
01:11:20.910 --> 01:11:23.240
<i>All they must do is
manage the shared facilities,</i>

852
01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:27.370
<i>and most have to take precautions
on their own.</i>

853
01:11:27.450 --> 01:11:32.210
<i>There is a movement
for a better fire prevention system.</i>

854
01:11:32.290 --> 01:11:33.630
<i>Next on the news.</i>

855
01:11:33.710 --> 01:11:37.260
<i>The recipients of the Christmas
special pardon were announced today.</i>

856
01:11:37.340 --> 01:11:42.010
<i>This Christmas season,
the Ministry of Justice decided to release</i>

857
01:11:42.090 --> 01:11:44.850
<i>758 model prisoners
with excellent behavior.</i>

858
01:11:45.180 --> 01:11:47.770
<i>Recipients include
Assemblyman Jeong-yeon Lee,</i>

859
01:11:47.850 --> 01:11:52.140
<i>who was sentenced to two years
and six months for embezzlement,</i>

860
01:11:52.270 --> 01:11:57.820
<i>and one of the accomplices of
the Songjin Club murders that stirred up</i>

861
01:11:57.900 --> 01:12:02.150
<i>the nation in 1995, who was
sentenced to life, reduced to 25 years,</i>

862
01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:04.120
<i>Kim, and others.</i>

863
01:12:04.870 --> 01:12:07.910
<i>Each facility will receive
the list of awardees,</i>

864
01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:09.700
<i>and the prisoners</i>

865
01:12:09.790 --> 01:12:13.750
<i>will be released before Christmas.</i>

866
01:13:05.010 --> 01:13:06.140
You!

867
01:13:07.850 --> 01:13:09.600
-You!
-What the fuck?

868
01:13:10.100 --> 01:13:11.220
Have you lost your mind?

869
01:13:11.970 --> 01:13:14.480
Shit. You crazy bitch...

870
01:13:18.270 --> 01:13:19.730
Who the hell are you?

871
01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:23.900
I'm Captain Jung-woo Yoo's big brother,
you son of a bitch.

872
01:13:39.130 --> 01:13:40.540
Are you okay, ma'am?

873
01:13:41.090 --> 01:13:42.380
Are you hurt?

874
01:13:47.130 --> 01:13:48.550
Are you...

875
01:13:49.930 --> 01:13:52.010
Private Park's mother?

876
01:13:59.730 --> 01:14:00.980
I'm sorry.

877
01:14:02.780 --> 01:14:07.990
I've said so many terrible things to you.

878
01:14:08.530 --> 01:14:09.990
I'm truly sorry.

879
01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:11.740
It's okay.

880
01:14:13.700 --> 01:14:14.580
I understand...

881
01:14:16.750 --> 01:14:17.710
how you felt.

882
01:14:23.090 --> 01:14:24.130
The truth is,

883
01:14:27.260 --> 01:14:29.010
after my son died,

884
01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:31.800
I looked at his journal,

885
01:14:33.810 --> 01:14:36.020
and he had written

886
01:14:36.730 --> 01:14:39.230
about only one person.

887
01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:42.060
It was...

888
01:14:45.070 --> 01:14:47.610
how much he adored Captain Yoo,

889
01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:51.370
and that he wanted to become...

890
01:14:52.740 --> 01:14:54.700
a captain like him.

891
01:14:56.870 --> 01:14:57.910
Back then,

892
01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:01.580
none of it registered.

893
01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:06.800
I couldn't make sense of any of it then.

894
01:15:09.550 --> 01:15:11.180
But I get it now,

895
01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:15.140
that Captain Yoo...

896
01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:17.890
was the one person...

897
01:15:19.310 --> 01:15:21.150
Jun-yeong trusted.

898
01:15:22.810 --> 01:15:24.610
But we did...

899
01:15:25.270 --> 01:15:28.990
such a terrible thing to that person.
I'm so sorry.

900
01:15:31.700 --> 01:15:33.490
I'm truly sorry.

901
01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:39.620
It's okay.

902
01:15:40.710 --> 01:15:41.790
It's okay, ma'am.

903
01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:46.000
We...

904
01:15:48.170 --> 01:15:49.090
We understand.

905
01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:53.090
I...

906
01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:56.100
and Jung-woo...

907
01:15:57.140 --> 01:15:58.600
understand everything.

908
01:16:07.690 --> 01:16:10.190
ESTABLISH ORDER, FOSTER MORALITY

909
01:16:14.490 --> 01:16:15.570
What?

910
01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:18.740
I have no money.

911
01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:30.170
You really are an idiot.

912
01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:33.340
You didn't know that?

913
01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:44.440
Also,

914
01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:47.520
stop calling me here.

915
01:16:48.690 --> 01:16:50.230
I'm busy, you bastard.

916
01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:03.870
Let's go. I don't have a key.

917
01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:06.290
Take me to my cell.

918
01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:07.790
What?

919
01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:13.420
That bastard.

920
01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:18.470
RESTRICTED

921
01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:23.640
Call the reporter.

922
01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:25.310
Wow...

923
01:17:25.810 --> 01:17:27.610
Je-hyeok Kim really is an idiot.

924
01:17:28.150 --> 01:17:29.820
I told you he was a psycho.

925
01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:34.150
Damn... Je-hyeok, that psycho freak.

926
01:17:35.110 --> 01:17:36.490
Take a picture.

927
01:17:38.570 --> 01:17:42.450
I already told the reporter,
and he's on standby,

928
01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:46.080
but he needs a photo.

929
01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:50.710
Get me a picture of the training facility.

930
01:18:13.110 --> 01:18:14.490
Je-hyeok...

931
01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:17.400
Incredible.

932
01:18:22.410 --> 01:18:23.660
<i>You're wearing the ring again.</i>

933
01:18:24.620 --> 01:18:26.580
Of course. You gave it to me.

934
01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:30.750
I didn't get the scholarship
when we got these rings too.

935
01:18:30.830 --> 01:18:32.170
I was too distracted dating.

936
01:18:40.470 --> 01:18:42.260
But Ji-ho.

937
01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:45.390
I have a problem.

938
01:18:48.020 --> 01:18:49.440
What do I do?

939
01:18:50.350 --> 01:18:52.520
If I tell the warden or Joon-ho,

940
01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:55.860
that bastard will go
right to the reporter.

941
01:18:56.990 --> 01:18:58.360
I want to go

942
01:18:59.610 --> 01:19:01.780
and beat the crap out of him,

943
01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:06.660
but that would only hurt me.

944
01:19:08.250 --> 01:19:09.290
It's driving me mad.

945
01:19:10.710 --> 01:19:11.830
Then, don't do it.

946
01:19:13.590 --> 01:19:15.550
I mean, stop training.

947
01:19:16.670 --> 01:19:17.630
Well...

948
01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:21.760
I get out in two months.

949
01:19:22.090 --> 01:19:25.470
I'm almost back in shape
and my speed is almost there.

950
01:19:26.140 --> 01:19:28.100
But, I should stop training?

951
01:19:31.650 --> 01:19:32.860
Je-hyeok.

952
01:19:33.310 --> 01:19:36.650
Do you want to play baseball,
or do you want to be the best?

953
01:19:39.490 --> 01:19:41.700
You're right.
You have two months left, right?

954
01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:44.530
You have only two months left.

955
01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:47.660
It took you so much to get here.

956
01:19:48.540 --> 01:19:52.000
You can't ruin it all
because of that piece of shit.

957
01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:55.670
You can make your comeback
two months later.

958
01:19:57.460 --> 01:20:00.880
The world won't come to an end
because you can't train for two months.

959
01:20:01.930 --> 01:20:05.760
Even if you make your return
two months later, your life will be fine,

960
01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:08.390
so empty out that training facility
right now, okay?

961
01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:14.350
Good boy.

962
01:20:20.190 --> 01:20:23.070
<i>Then, you can't train anymore.</i>

963
01:20:23.410 --> 01:20:26.740
No. Why should I clear out
your training facility? No.

964
01:20:27.950 --> 01:20:29.040
It's okay.

965
01:20:30.250 --> 01:20:32.710
I know people say
I'm getting preferential treatment.

966
01:20:33.580 --> 01:20:35.960
I've trained enough up to now.

967
01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:40.130
-Thank you.
-Who says it's preferential treatment?

968
01:20:40.210 --> 01:20:42.840
Bring him to me.
I'll throw him into the hole.

969
01:20:44.550 --> 01:20:45.930
It is preferential treatment.

970
01:20:46.890 --> 01:20:48.810
You did give him preferential treatment.

971
01:20:49.770 --> 01:20:51.930
I always thought it was improper.

972
01:20:52.810 --> 01:20:56.480
Now that he said to empty it out,
I'll do it right now.

973
01:20:57.190 --> 01:20:58.320
Is that okay?

974
01:21:06.070 --> 01:21:10.080
God... He's so annoying.
I can't stand him.

975
01:21:33.270 --> 01:21:36.020
What's wrong? Why are you running?

976
01:21:37.860 --> 01:21:38.770
Jailbird.

977
01:21:40.270 --> 01:21:41.440
He's in the hole.

978
01:21:43.860 --> 01:21:46.070
He was caught dealing a banned drug,

979
01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:49.370
and got 30 days in the hole.

980
01:21:52.330 --> 01:21:53.500
Who ratted him out?

981
01:21:55.750 --> 01:21:56.710
Chief Yeom.

982
01:21:58.790 --> 01:22:01.210
That bastard ratted on him
directly to Correctional Service.

983
01:22:28.570 --> 01:22:32.830
I help people denounce their crime
and repent.

984
01:22:32.910 --> 01:22:34.660
What did you say, you bastard?

985
01:22:34.750 --> 01:22:36.960
Let go. Let go of me! Let go!

986
01:22:37.750 --> 01:22:41.040
Just let him bark away. Ignore him.
Why do you let him get to you?

987
01:22:41.130 --> 01:22:43.460
-You can do that?
-Yes. I can!

988
01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:47.510
Lieutenant Paeng will be disciplined
if he gets another demerit.

989
01:22:47.590 --> 01:22:49.760
-Stay out of it.
<i>-I knew his temper</i>

990
01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:51.350
<i>would get him in trouble.</i>

991
01:22:53.220 --> 01:22:54.930
<i>The cell's all split up.</i>

992
01:22:55.020 --> 01:22:56.730
<i>Min-chul gets out tomorrow, right?</i>

993
01:22:56.850 --> 01:22:58.440
<i>Je-hyeok Kim is leaving too.</i>

994
01:22:58.520 --> 01:23:01.810
What if our dear Captain Yoo
is left all alone?

995
01:23:01.940 --> 01:23:04.780
Don't worry about me.
I'll get out soon too.

996
01:23:04.860 --> 01:23:08.070
<i>This came to my house,
saying he'll kill me if I testify.</i>

997
01:23:08.860 --> 01:23:10.780
-What is that?
<i>-Did something come</i>

998
01:23:10.860 --> 01:23:12.660
<i>for Jung-woo Yoo?</i>

999
01:23:13.660 --> 01:23:14.660
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1000
01:23:15.540 --> 01:23:16.540
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1001
01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:21.420
So, who's the next target?

1002
01:23:22.330 --> 01:23:25.050
I'll take care of it. I'll handle it.

1003
01:23:25.130 --> 01:23:27.050
Handle what? Don't do it.

1004
01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:28.800
<i>You're almost there.</i>

1005
01:23:30.930 --> 01:23:32.050
Je-hyeok Kim.

1006
01:23:33.050 --> 01:23:34.640
<i>Pay it back with your body.</i>

1007
01:23:34.890 --> 01:23:38.060
<i>Come to the woodshop at midnight.
Come alone.</i>

1008
01:23:39.020 --> 01:23:42.150
<i>Nothing more should happen here.</i>

1009
01:23:43.110 --> 01:23:47.150
<i>You'll stay with me
even if I quit baseball, right?</i>
