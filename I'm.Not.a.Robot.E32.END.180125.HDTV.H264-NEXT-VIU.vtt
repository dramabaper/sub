1
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.619
Gosh, I suddenly have a headache.

2
00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:12.920
You know what? You should just come to my house.

3
00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:17.160
- What? - My brother...

4
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.289
won't be able to take his word back anymore.

5
00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.329
So you should come to my house...

6
00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:24.430
and give his letter of resignation back...

7
00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.500
right in front of my sister-in-law.

8
00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.669
Then my brother won't be able to refuse.

9
00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.070
I get what you mean. I think I can do that. Okay.

10
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.470
And...

11
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.610
if I go over to your house,

12
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.720
are you going to show me your room?

13
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.319
No, I can't show you my room. It's too dirty.

14
00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.360
You already saw my room. Why can't I see yours?

15
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.970
To be honest, I...

16
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.319
You're a fast learner.

17
00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:29.899
I'm going to kill you if you kiss.

18
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.140
You video called me because you knew I took my makeup off, didn't you?

19
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.479
No. I just wanted to see your face while we talked.

20
00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:44.910
It hasn't even been that long since we said goodbye.

21
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.390
Why did you bring me here?

22
00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.330
Someone told me that this place is really popular.

23
00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:00.729
What?

24
00:02:01.129 --> 00:02:02.899
Let's have fun.

25
00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:06.200
We need to have fun in order to come up with new ideas.

26
00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:07.899
Okay, then.

27
00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.040
But it's no fun to play games without any conditions.

28
00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:13.869
- Then what do you suggest? - Let's make a bet.

29
00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:17.239
The winner has to pay for the movie.

30
00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:19.149
Not the loser?

31
00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:22.080
It'll be too harsh to make the loser pay.

32
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.320
The winner can pay for the sake of winning.

33
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.719
Okay. The one who wins 2 games out of 3 wins. Where should we start?

34
00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:32.089
Let's start with that.

35
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.260
Okay.

36
00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:37.230
I'll make sure I win so that I can pay for the movie.

37
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.270
Let's go.

38
00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.360
You were so close.

39
00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.390
Let's go.

40
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.159
Let's go.

41
00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:23.510
My gosh.

42
00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:26.080
You're so cute.

43
00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.619
This is too much for me.

44
00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:36.860
Everyone else but me is dating.

45
00:03:38.029 --> 00:03:39.290
This is sad.

46
00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:44.059
Even the sauce container is in a pair. How annoying.

47
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.270
Eddie?

48
00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.239
Jane?

49
00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.010
When did you come to Korea? No, that's not right.

50
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:00.749
When did you come to Korea?

51
00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:05.350
I mean, how come you are in Korea?

52
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.920
I'm just here for a business trip for, like, a couple of months.

53
00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:10.760
Business trip?

54
00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:15.260
Dear all holy beings, thank you.

55
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.430
What did you just say?

56
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.700
No, it's nothing.

57
00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.899
Anyway, it's great to see you again, Eddie.

58
00:04:22.899 --> 00:04:26.539
Are you here with someone or do you want to come with us?

59
00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:27.979
Absolutely.

60
00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:30.440
Let's go. Let's go, Jane.

61
00:04:32.049 --> 00:04:33.709
Cheers.

62
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.659
- Oh, my gosh. - Are you serious?

63
00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.330
Oh. Yes.

64
00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:47.959
One more time.

65
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.399
There are still a lot of people.

66
00:04:55.899 --> 00:04:58.669
Watching people is fun too.

67
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.779
This feels nice.

68
00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:05.479
I like it too.

69
00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:11.390
I think...

70
00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.890
we spent too long in the laboratory.

71
00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.729
We develop robots that communicate with humans,

72
00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:20.130
but we ourselves...

73
00:05:20.959 --> 00:05:23.130
didn't have much contact with the outside world.

74
00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.200
We were all too busy with research.

75
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.810
Let's do this more often.

76
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:34.839
Sure.

77
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.810
What do you think is around that corner?

78
00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:40.950
Let's go and find out.

79
00:05:42.149 --> 00:05:43.320
Sure, let's.

80
00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:53.260
You put on a terrific scheme.

81
00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.359
Did you enjoy coaxing the naive kids?

82
00:05:58.399 --> 00:05:59.529
Yoo Cheol...

83
00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:02.270
will soon be reinstated as CEO.

84
00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.770
Both Yoo Cheol and Ri El...

85
00:06:06.109 --> 00:06:08.839
will live their own lives.

86
00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:13.909
We will run KM Financial in a way that is very different from before.

87
00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:15.380
You arrogant fool.

88
00:06:15.549 --> 00:06:17.419
You and my dad...

89
00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:19.419
parted ways as enemies.

90
00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:22.219
Yoo Cheol and I are different.

91
00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:25.789
We will not repeat what...

92
00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:27.690
went wrong in the past.

93
00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:36.940
Everything is over at last.

94
00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.070
How do you feel? Relieved?

95
00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:42.109
I don't feel as relieved...

96
00:06:42.109 --> 00:06:45.209
or excited as I thought I would.

97
00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:47.180
I just think...

98
00:06:48.049 --> 00:06:51.180
I'm realizing that what happened...

99
00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.820
in the past no longer hurts me.

100
00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.060
That's a huge deal. You're healing.

101
00:06:58.729 --> 00:07:02.029
Though we'll never know when you'll get hurt again.

102
00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:05.070
Now, I think I can befriend that too.

103
00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:07.430
Yes.

104
00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:10.799
If you comfort yourself along the way so that...

105
00:07:10.799 --> 00:07:13.469
you're less hurt and less sad, time will pass.

106
00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:17.310
Doctor, I think I need to hang up.

107
00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:19.709
I'm getting an urgent call.

108
00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:21.719
Is it Ji A?

109
00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.120
You're hurting me now, you know.

110
00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.450
Doctor Oh.

111
00:07:25.719 --> 00:07:28.089
I'll call you right back. Bye.

112
00:07:29.959 --> 00:07:31.120
Hi, it's me.

113
00:07:32.289 --> 00:07:35.430
My brother's at home right now. So is Hong Joo.

114
00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:39.830
Oh, really? Okay, then.

115
00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:41.940
I'm wearing a suit right now.

116
00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:44.039
I'm not even wearing a tie.

117
00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:45.370
That's perfect.

118
00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:47.370
Is it? Okay, then.

119
00:07:48.979 --> 00:07:52.180
Hey, what does your niece like?

120
00:07:58.149 --> 00:08:00.890
A drought warning was raised again today.

121
00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:04.589
It covers Seoul, most parts of the southern region and...

122
00:08:04.589 --> 00:08:08.899
Why did you go and do what you did?

123
00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.000
Sorry, Dong Hyun.

124
00:08:11.099 --> 00:08:12.770
If you plan to go hiking...

125
00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:16.039
I'm on your side, whatever anyone else says.

126
00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.310
Today, most of Korea will be sunny.

127
00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:22.240
Tomorrow as well, we'll have...

128
00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:36.620
- Sir. - Nice to... No.

129
00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:39.929
How are you?

130
00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:42.500
Why are you here?

131
00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.230
Oh, Ji A?

132
00:08:45.329 --> 00:08:47.130
- Ji A. - No, I...

133
00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:49.669
I'm here to see you.

134
00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:52.370
It's Kim Min Kyu.

135
00:08:54.169 --> 00:08:55.840
Hi, Jo Dong Hyun.

136
00:08:57.079 --> 00:08:58.480
How do you know my daughter?

137
00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.949
That's...

138
00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.279
- A secret. - A secret?

139
00:09:04.549 --> 00:09:05.620
A secret.

140
00:09:26.039 --> 00:09:28.809
Do you like stewed chicken?

141
00:09:29.309 --> 00:09:30.380
Yes.

142
00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:32.350
Have some with us.

143
00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:33.380
Okay.

144
00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:07.179
She was cute.

145
00:10:09.049 --> 00:10:11.350
She was just like how she is now.

146
00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:28.799
I wanted to meet you.

147
00:10:32.039 --> 00:10:33.069
What?

148
00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:36.439
Did your allergy go away?

149
00:10:37.439 --> 00:10:39.309
Yes, it did.

150
00:10:39.309 --> 00:10:42.480
The person you said you liked a lot...

151
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.079
was my aunt, right?

152
00:10:45.819 --> 00:10:47.120
Yes, it was.

153
00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:50.490
But that's our secret.

154
00:10:56.399 --> 00:11:00.829
I wasn't sure what to buy, so...

155
00:11:00.829 --> 00:11:02.870
You didn't have to get me anything.

156
00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:10.510
Wow, this is so pretty.

157
00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:12.510
- Thank you. - Sure.

158
00:11:13.079 --> 00:11:14.779
This is so cute.

159
00:11:16.649 --> 00:11:18.549
It's lovely.

160
00:11:31.569 --> 00:11:34.029
It looks like they're on a blind date.

161
00:11:35.439 --> 00:11:36.699
It does.

162
00:11:39.539 --> 00:11:40.669
Mr. Kim.

163
00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:42.140
Yes?

164
00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.179
Why are you here?

165
00:11:46.579 --> 00:11:47.579
Well...

166
00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:51.020
I...

167
00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:56.990
I don't think I can live without Mr. Jo.

168
00:11:57.490 --> 00:11:58.490
What?

169
00:11:58.659 --> 00:11:59.789
Mr. Jo.

170
00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:02.460
I like you.

171
00:12:03.799 --> 00:12:04.929
A lot.

172
00:12:09.899 --> 00:12:11.539
To me, you are...

173
00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:16.110
a colleague and mentor I want to keep close forever.

174
00:12:17.409 --> 00:12:20.279
Dad, you're so cool.

175
00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:22.579
Yes, he's amazing.

176
00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:25.449
Therefore,

177
00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:29.419
I cannot accept your resignation.

178
00:12:29.789 --> 00:12:34.429
I'd like you to tear it up yourself.

179
00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:40.199
I have a condition.

180
00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:43.399
Sure, what is it?

181
00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.370
For as long as you date my sister,

182
00:12:45.809 --> 00:12:47.909
let's keep work apart from our private lives.

183
00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:49.279
I agree.

184
00:12:49.279 --> 00:12:51.610
At work, you're my superior,

185
00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:54.880
but once we leave work, can I...

186
00:12:55.549 --> 00:12:57.620
treat you like my sister's boyfriend?

187
00:12:59.049 --> 00:13:01.819
Yes, please do that.

188
00:13:02.159 --> 00:13:03.490
Okay, Min Kyu.

189
00:13:10.559 --> 00:13:14.230
Okay, then, Jin Bae.

190
00:13:31.419 --> 00:13:34.890
There's really nothing to see in here.

191
00:13:41.329 --> 00:13:44.770
(Scissors that help you cut in a straight line.)

192

<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

194
00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.059
What should I do?

195
00:14:49.899 --> 00:14:50.929
Why?

196
00:14:50.929 --> 00:14:52.669
I like you even more.

197
00:14:56.169 --> 00:14:58.069
- I have all this. - What?

198
00:14:58.069 --> 00:15:01.380
Everything you made is in my yellow cabinet at home.

199
00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:02.880
That's a lie.

200
00:15:03.939 --> 00:15:05.279
Come and see for yourself.

201
00:15:06.449 --> 00:15:08.279
The cleaning thing too?

202
00:15:09.419 --> 00:15:10.419
Yes.

203
00:15:11.049 --> 00:15:12.289
No way.

204
00:15:13.649 --> 00:15:16.120
You were the 1 out of 5 people?

205
00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:20.659
Where did you get them? I barely sold any.

206
00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.460
Kiss me and I'll tell.

207
00:15:28.569 --> 00:15:29.640
Auntie.

208
00:15:30.799 --> 00:15:32.510
Mom's acting strange.

209
00:15:34.439 --> 00:15:36.480
Wait, do you need anything?

210
00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:37.510
- No. - My wallet.

211
00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:38.949
Mom, are you okay?

212
00:15:38.949 --> 00:15:40.179
- Yes. - She's okay.

213
00:15:40.179 --> 00:15:41.720
Ask Auntie to dress you.

214
00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.079
Hurry, we need a car.

215
00:15:43.079 --> 00:15:44.120
Call a taxi.

216
00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.319
I'll drive you.

217
00:15:45.319 --> 00:15:47.189
Okay, your car, then.

218
00:15:47.449 --> 00:15:49.360
Dong Hyun, come on outside.

219
00:15:49.559 --> 00:15:50.559
Take your time.

220
00:15:57.899 --> 00:15:59.230
It's okay, Hong Joo.

221
00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:01.130
It'll be okay.

222
00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:04.770
This is our second child.

223
00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:06.539
Don't get too tense.

224
00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:11.579
It's okay.

225
00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:15.750
Dad, look at me. I grew up pretty well.

226
00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:17.020
You did.

227
00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:19.390
Hold your mom's hand.

228
00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:23.289
Take a deep breath.

229
00:16:24.829 --> 00:16:26.159
(Labor Ward)

230
00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:43.340
Hong Joo's fine.

231
00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:45.179
The baby's healthy.

232
00:16:49.049 --> 00:16:50.120
My daughter...

233
00:16:51.049 --> 00:16:52.120
is beautiful.

234
00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:54.789
Like a princess.

235
00:16:55.559 --> 00:16:58.460
- You're a big sister now. - Yes.

236
00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:04.600
She looks so pretty.

237
00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:07.270
Like an angel, right?

238
00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:09.770
That's your sister, Dong Hyun.

239
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.740
Welcome. It's your first day in the world.

240
00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:27.220
(2 years later)

241
00:17:41.569 --> 00:17:42.569
We wish to...

242
00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.309
make connections to something...

243
00:17:45.809 --> 00:17:48.279
and wish to touch something.

244
00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:51.010
That's because of the instinct...

245
00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:54.210
that was hardwired into our DNA.

246
00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:56.220
The Santa Maria Team...

247
00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:58.589
focused on that instinct...

248
00:17:58.589 --> 00:18:00.849
while developing our new robot with AI.

249
00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:05.529
If there were a robot that could communicate on an emotional level,

250
00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:08.160
how would our lives change?

251
00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:10.200
To a person...

252
00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.799
who is physically and emotionally drained,

253
00:18:13.529 --> 00:18:17.000
what would it mean to have a robot that comforts them...

254
00:18:17.139 --> 00:18:19.609
with emotions that were programmed into it?

255
00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:23.109
I can tell you with confidence that...

256
00:18:23.109 --> 00:18:25.650
that would make us more human.

257
00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:29.779
The something that flows from human to human.

258
00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:33.619
If we could unravel the secret behind emotional connections,

259
00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:37.819
I was confident we could create a revolutionary AI robot.

260
00:18:39.359 --> 00:18:40.389
And finally,

261
00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:45.400
the Santa Maria Team succeeded in solving part of that secret.

262
00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.529
We named the robot...

263
00:18:48.369 --> 00:18:51.639
after Daeyang Shipbuilding's late Chairman Park Sung Jin.

264
00:18:58.279 --> 00:18:59.279
Ladies and gentlemen.

265
00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:03.920
Let me introduce the robot that will rewrite the history of androids.

266
00:19:17.099 --> 00:19:18.129
Hello.

267
00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:29.139

(Managing Director Jo Jin Bae)

269
00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:07.680
I'll leave right now.

270
00:20:13.289 --> 00:20:14.859
Shall we proceed it like this?

271
00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:18.460
Yes. Do more research over the weekend...

272
00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:20.490
and we'll meet again on Monday morning.

273
00:20:20.559 --> 00:20:21.960
- Okay. - Great.

274
00:20:25.069 --> 00:20:26.529
I have to go.

275
00:20:36.339 --> 00:20:37.710
- Let's go. - Okay.

276
00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:41.210
We won't be late, will we?

277
00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:43.079
I think we'll be on time.

278
00:20:50.819 --> 00:20:53.260
- The diapers... - Honey.

279
00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:54.460
Oh, dear.

280
00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:55.799
I woke her up.

281
00:20:55.799 --> 00:20:57.460
You just woke up?

282
00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:00.270
- Oh, dear. - Pack the rest.

283
00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:02.700
We're running late, let's hurry.

284
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:16.849
Honey, I'm nearly there, I see the building right now.

285
00:21:16.849 --> 00:21:18.289
See you soon.

286
00:21:26.529 --> 00:21:28.930
People can choose their own designs.

287
00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:32.470
Would you be able to provide engraving service as well?

288
00:21:32.869 --> 00:21:33.900
Sure.

289
00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:36.839
The color. Can that also be an option?

290
00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:42.210
I haven't thought about it yet, but that could also be possible.

291
00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:56.889
Okay, so you can send us the samples by the end of the month...

292
00:21:56.889 --> 00:21:58.460
and the rest in two weeks, right?

293
00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:00.190
Yes, no problem.

294
00:22:00.389 --> 00:22:02.500
And we might be able to give a demonstration...

295
00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:03.629
before the shipping arrives...

296
00:22:03.629 --> 00:22:06.029
and maybe ensure a few distribution channels?

297
00:22:06.129 --> 00:22:07.670
That would be wonderful.

298
00:22:08.139 --> 00:22:12.170
Oh, how about using social media to release it to the public?

299
00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:14.510
Since its function is based on networking,

300
00:22:15.109 --> 00:22:18.450
I think it could appeal to a lot of the social media users.

301
00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:20.680
Sure, that's a good idea.

302
00:23:14.029 --> 00:23:16.000
I really...

303
00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:18.609
missed you.

304
00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:22.539
Congratulations on your discharge. Well done.

305
00:23:23.109 --> 00:23:25.710
The day actually came.

306
00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:36.059
Aren't you hungry?

307
00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:38.990
I'm starving.

308
00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:41.629
Let's go. Everyone's waiting for you.

309
00:23:45.869 --> 00:23:49.139
- I had so much to tell you. - Like what?

310
00:23:49.139 --> 00:23:51.670
I signed a contract with an overseas buyer.

311
00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:53.270
I'm so happy!

312
00:23:55.109 --> 00:23:58.650
I also have this new idea that I recently thought of.

313
00:23:58.650 --> 00:23:59.779
It's about...

314
00:24:12.029 --> 00:24:13.230
This is...

315
00:24:16.599 --> 00:24:18.369
when we kiss.

316
00:25:25.029 --> 00:25:32.839
(Thank you for watching I'm Not a Robot.)
