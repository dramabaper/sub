3
00:00:21.188 --> 00:00:24.918
Do you remember the famous catchphrase...

4
00:00:25.018 --> 00:00:26.358
from the movie, "Architecture 101"?

5
00:00:28.428 --> 00:00:32.628
"We were all somebody's first love."

6
00:00:34.798 --> 00:00:38.667
"You, and you too."

7
00:00:40.268 --> 00:00:41.938
"During that time,"

8
00:00:42.868 --> 00:00:46.037
"we were all a boy or a girl in love,"

9
00:00:46.777 --> 00:00:51.148
"and we could have been someone's first love."

10
00:00:51.847 --> 00:00:54.588
Dear listeners of Mi Nu's Happy 6pm,

11
00:00:54.588 --> 00:00:56.417
today...

12
00:00:58.558 --> 00:01:00.228
Wrap it up.

13
00:01:03.188 --> 00:01:05.598
Are you ready to go back...

14
00:01:05.598 --> 00:01:07.198
to when you were someone's first love?

15
00:01:07.698 --> 00:01:08.728
No one's picking up?

16
00:01:08.997 --> 00:01:10.568
No. I'll try again.

17
00:01:12.898 --> 00:01:13.967
Hello?

18
00:01:14.167 --> 00:01:16.038
Where is Mi Nu?

19
00:01:16.038 --> 00:01:19.308
How can you do this every live show?

20
00:01:20.277 --> 00:01:21.777
What do we do?

21
00:01:22.247 --> 00:01:24.818
They want to bomb our radio studio.

22
00:01:24.818 --> 00:01:27.187
Dear listeners of Mi Nu's Happy 6pm,

23
00:01:27.187 --> 00:01:28.948
This is...

24
00:01:28.948 --> 00:01:30.687
not Mi Nu.

25
00:01:30.687 --> 00:01:32.917
I'm a sub-writer, Song Geu Rim.

26
00:01:33.627 --> 00:01:37.127
You must be getting used to my voice now.

27
00:01:37.127 --> 00:01:39.327
(Happy 6pm's DJ Mi Nu)

28
00:01:39.327 --> 00:01:42.467
Mi Nu must be stuck in bad traffic.

29
00:01:42.467 --> 00:01:45.297
I did the opening in his place.

30
00:01:48.738 --> 00:01:49.738
(Mi Nu)

31
00:01:56.148 --> 00:01:59.577
Everyone, I'm getting a call from Mi Nu.

32
00:01:59.577 --> 00:02:02.387
He was stuck in traffic last time too.

33
00:02:02.488 --> 00:02:04.857
Do you remember how we did the show...

34
00:02:04.857 --> 00:02:05.917
through the phone?

35
00:02:05.917 --> 00:02:09.027
I'll connect him to see where he's at.

36
00:02:11.458 --> 00:02:12.627
Darn Mi Nu...

37
00:02:14.898 --> 00:02:17.768
I mean...

38
00:02:18.037 --> 00:02:20.407
Darn good-looking Mi Nu!

39
00:02:20.507 --> 00:02:21.808
Where are you right now?

40
00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:23.808
I won't do radio!

41
00:02:24.507 --> 00:02:25.838
Stop calling me.

42
00:02:26.437 --> 00:02:29.608
I said, I won't do such a thing anymore.

43
00:02:31.048 --> 00:02:38.118
(Silence)

44
00:02:38.118 --> 00:02:40.328
(Broadcasting accident)

45
00:02:42.558 --> 00:02:43.657
Surprise!

46
00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:46.768
Darn good-looking Mi Nu is such a prankster.

47
00:02:47.727 --> 00:02:50.868
He must be preparing a surprise for us.

48
00:02:52.997 --> 00:02:55.368
It's the first song on Mi Nu's Happy 6pm.

49
00:02:55.368 --> 00:02:57.608
This song reminds us of our first loves.

50
00:02:57.877 --> 00:03:00.747
It's Kim Dong Ryul's "Saying I Love You Again".

51
00:03:08.518 --> 00:03:12.217
Darn you, Mi Nu!

52
00:03:16.358 --> 00:03:20.368
You idiots!

53
00:03:20.768 --> 00:03:21.798
(Episode 1)

54
00:03:21.798 --> 00:03:26.168
What is it that you do?

55
00:03:26.937 --> 00:03:29.208
Forget it. Your team is the worst.

56
00:03:29.407 --> 00:03:33.007
You don't get listeners. Just move out.

57
00:03:33.447 --> 00:03:34.847
But Mr. Kang...

58
00:03:34.847 --> 00:03:36.918
What? What?

59
00:03:37.747 --> 00:03:41.118
Your idol DJ...

60
00:03:41.118 --> 00:03:45.418
always misses his show or does it drunk.

61
00:03:45.757 --> 00:03:48.757
You're a producer. Can't you control him?

62
00:03:48.757 --> 00:03:51.257
You always let it become a complete mess.

63
00:04:00.437 --> 00:04:02.437
Do you think you're a DJ?

64
00:04:02.838 --> 00:04:05.007
Why are you always...

65
00:04:05.007 --> 00:04:07.178
going in front of the microphone?

66
00:04:08.108 --> 00:04:10.007
What? "Darn Mi Nu"?

67
00:04:10.447 --> 00:04:13.787
Can you say anything if a DJ skips the show?

68
00:04:17.187 --> 00:04:19.718
So, can you get in touch...

69
00:04:20.257 --> 00:04:21.788
with Darn Mi Nu or not?

70
00:04:26.428 --> 00:04:27.468
I'm sorry.

71
00:04:28.327 --> 00:04:29.868
We haven't...

72
00:04:30.238 --> 00:04:31.697
Don't be sorry.

73
00:04:32.968 --> 00:04:35.108
Please, don't be sorry to me.

74
00:04:35.368 --> 00:04:37.877
Just move out.

75
00:04:39.207 --> 00:04:42.877
If you have conscience, think about it.

76
00:04:42.877 --> 00:04:46.887
You ruin the live show every four days.

77
00:04:46.887 --> 00:04:49.848
How can I trust you with anything?

78
00:04:50.558 --> 00:04:52.288
We can't live from hand to mouth.

79
00:04:52.288 --> 00:04:54.658
What will you do about tomorrow's show?

80
00:04:54.658 --> 00:04:56.587
Well? Well?

81
00:04:58.228 --> 00:05:00.197
I'll bring him no matter what.

82
00:05:01.397 --> 00:05:04.538
I know where Mi Nu is better than his manager.

83
00:05:08.408 --> 00:05:12.377
What if you're the one going on air tomorrow?

84
00:05:13.238 --> 00:05:14.278
That's unacceptable.

85
00:05:14.808 --> 00:05:17.218
We should disperse. You should fire me.

86
00:05:17.478 --> 00:05:20.387
If you tell us to move out, we will.

87
00:05:20.387 --> 00:05:22.387
I'll bring him no matter what.

88
00:05:31.658 --> 00:05:35.497
(A Strategist's Scenario)

89
00:05:37.137 --> 00:05:40.937
Hey, how can a manager not know?

90
00:05:41.337 --> 00:05:44.337
Our show will cancel because of Mi Nu!

91
00:05:44.978 --> 00:05:48.548
Listen, I can't control him either.

92
00:05:48.747 --> 00:05:51.218
I don't know if he's drinking...

93
00:05:51.218 --> 00:05:52.348
or hanging out with girls.

94
00:05:52.478 --> 00:05:54.247
We aren't renewing his contract anyway.

95
00:05:54.247 --> 00:05:55.618
I don't care anymore.

96
00:05:55.618 --> 00:05:58.887
Hello? Hello?

97
00:06:00.457 --> 00:06:05.158
Are you serious? I'll kill them all.

98
00:06:06.228 --> 00:06:08.028
So, did you find him?

99
00:06:08.028 --> 00:06:10.238
Ms. La looks like she's in a bad mood.

100
00:06:10.238 --> 00:06:12.598
Her nails are all black.

101
00:06:13.868 --> 00:06:17.178
Did I ever make you write while helping me?

102
00:06:19.178 --> 00:06:23.447
I never ask you to write because you're bad at it!

103
00:06:24.647 --> 00:06:27.048
That's why I asked you to be in charge...

104
00:06:27.048 --> 00:06:29.447
of the DJ and to recruit guests!

105
00:06:29.447 --> 00:06:31.387
It was your job to take care of it!

106
00:06:33.288 --> 00:06:34.587
Why did I even bother?

107
00:06:35.058 --> 00:06:36.997
Not everyone can be a writer, okay?

108
00:06:38.058 --> 00:06:39.058
Gosh.

109
00:06:48.507 --> 00:06:51.738
You darn celebrity. Just pick up.

110
00:06:54.108 --> 00:06:55.147
Cool.

111
00:06:55.707 --> 00:06:58.077
Hey. What are you doing?

112
00:06:59.247 --> 00:07:01.147
This keeps popping up on the main page.

113

(Ji Soo Ho, "Rainy Day" Press Conference)

114
00:07:05.218 --> 00:07:07.827

The number you're calling is not available...

116

Are you serious?

117
00:07:14.368 --> 00:07:17.868
Darn Mi Nu, I'm going to get you.

("Rainy Day")

119
00:07:34.387 --> 00:07:36.757
Our dear arrogant star...

120
00:07:36.757 --> 00:07:39.058
decided to skip the live show...

121
00:07:39.387 --> 00:07:44.327
to drench himself with alcohol here?

122
00:07:48.228 --> 00:07:52.067
I will break him into pieces today.

123
00:07:56.207 --> 00:07:57.238
This way.

124
00:07:57.437 --> 00:07:58.877
Ji Soo Ho, over here.

125

Please pose together.

128

Ji Soo Ho, you're known to be picky...

129
00:08:08.418 --> 00:08:11.218
with choosing your work. Why did you choose this?

130
00:08:12.218 --> 00:08:14.358
I've been focusing on films lately,

131
00:08:14.358 --> 00:08:17.098
so I really wanted to get closer to my fans.

132
00:08:17.127 --> 00:08:20.058
This drama is shot in entirety before airing,

133
00:08:20.058 --> 00:08:21.827
so I was able to read all of the scripts.

134
00:08:21.827 --> 00:08:23.538
I had confidence in the project.

135
00:08:24.038 --> 00:08:26.808
We already shot about 80 percent.

136
00:08:26.808 --> 00:08:28.837
Please give us your love and attention.

137
00:08:31.577 --> 00:08:34.207
Are you sure it's not because...

138
00:08:34.207 --> 00:08:35.878
JH is producing the series?

139
00:08:36.548 --> 00:08:39.048
Your mother, Nam Joo Ha,

is the CEO of JH Entertainment.

141

Well,

142
00:08:42.388 --> 00:08:44.158
I'm sure your mother had an influence.

It's true that influenced my decision.

00:08:49.158 --> 00:08:50.957
All profits made by the drama...

146
00:08:50.957 --> 00:08:53.668
will be donated to a leukemia fund.

147

Yes. Yes.

171
00:11:21.347 --> 00:11:22.707
Do you know her?

172
00:11:24.048 --> 00:11:26.648
No, I thought she was getting on.

173
00:11:37.197 --> 00:11:39.498
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

174
00:11:39.898 --> 00:11:41.067
Congratulations, honey.

175
00:11:41.428 --> 00:11:42.967
Thank you.

176
00:11:48.867 --> 00:11:50.977
Happy birthday, my darling.

177
00:11:51.178 --> 00:11:52.778
I know you love roses.

178
00:11:53.408 --> 00:11:55.148
They're beautiful.

179
00:11:55.148 --> 00:11:58.447
Pink hydrangea is her favorite.

180
00:12:00.317 --> 00:12:01.817
This scarf...

181
00:12:02.817 --> 00:12:04.457
would look good with your dress. Well?

182
00:12:07.987 --> 00:12:09.857
Something small and shiny is the best.

183
00:12:12.998 --> 00:12:15.628
That's why I got something too.

184
00:12:19.168 --> 00:12:20.638
It's so beautiful.

185
00:12:20.638 --> 00:12:22.867
She loves shoes the most.

186
00:12:22.867 --> 00:12:24.508
It came across the ocean.

187
00:12:26.678 --> 00:12:27.808
Even shoes?

188
00:12:28.508 --> 00:12:30.947
- What do I do? - Gosh.

189
00:12:33.987 --> 00:12:37.857
Yes. I'm coming down with Mi Nu.

190
00:12:38.617 --> 00:12:40.128
Are you in the parking level?

191
00:12:40.628 --> 00:12:41.857
Okay.

192
00:12:42.857 --> 00:12:45.827
Don't worry. He's still on his feet.

193
00:12:46.327 --> 00:12:49.298
Yes. See you in the parking lot.

194
00:12:52.937 --> 00:12:54.837
Darn Mi Nu.

195
00:12:55.168 --> 00:12:56.908
Wake up, will you?

196
00:12:57.308 --> 00:12:58.408
- Hey! - Hey!

197
00:12:59.837 --> 00:13:01.048
What is this?

198
00:13:01.808 --> 00:13:04.717
All I need is you.

199
00:13:05.248 --> 00:13:06.548
I mean it.

200
00:13:07.248 --> 00:13:09.748
From now on,

201
00:13:09.788 --> 00:13:12.558
I'll be good on the radio show.

202
00:13:12.957 --> 00:13:16.957
I'll do the show forever with you.

203
00:13:19.758 --> 00:13:21.128
Loyalty!

204
00:13:21.967 --> 00:13:23.437
Loyalty!

205
00:13:24.168 --> 00:13:25.337
Loyalty...

206
00:13:26.097 --> 00:13:28.237
Stop saying scary things like that.

207
00:13:28.237 --> 00:13:30.638
Let's go quietly.

208
00:13:54.528 --> 00:13:56.227
What? No way.

209
00:13:57.097 --> 00:13:58.337
It's Ji Soo Ho.

210
00:13:59.668 --> 00:14:02.967
Is that really him? He's so arrogant.

211
00:14:12.847 --> 00:14:15.717
I don't think he remembers me.

212
00:14:16.548 --> 00:14:18.957
Should I just try to recruit him as a guest?

213
00:14:25.028 --> 00:14:26.097
Darn Mi...

214
00:14:28.628 --> 00:14:29.867
Mi Nu.

215
00:14:29.898 --> 00:14:32.197
You should wake up.

216
00:14:33.067 --> 00:14:35.408
At least cover your face.

217
00:14:36.237 --> 00:14:40.248
I'm going to go all the way with you!

218
00:14:42.607 --> 00:14:44.817
I'll do everything...

219
00:14:45.248 --> 00:14:47.648
you tell me to do.

220
00:14:48.788 --> 00:14:52.817
All I have is you.

221
00:14:54.487 --> 00:14:56.687
Hey, watch it.

222
00:15:16.278 --> 00:15:17.847
Thank you.

223
00:15:20.187 --> 00:15:22.087
Kang Mi Nu looks very drunk.

224
00:15:23.918 --> 00:15:25.317
Yes.

225
00:15:27.327 --> 00:15:29.327
Yes, you're right.

226
00:15:29.687 --> 00:15:31.658
It's so difficult...

227
00:15:31.658 --> 00:15:33.567
to work with a DJ who likes to drink.

228
00:15:34.428 --> 00:15:37.498
I'm a sub-writer for Mi Nu's Happy 6pm.

229
00:15:37.697 --> 00:15:39.398
I work for a radio show.

230
00:15:41.808 --> 00:15:44.477
I can't believe I ran into you.

231
00:15:45.437 --> 00:15:46.508
Ji Soo Ho,

232
00:15:46.508 --> 00:15:49.548
won't you be a guest on our show?

233
00:15:50.778 --> 00:15:52.317
I'd be honored if you ask me.

234
00:15:52.678 --> 00:15:55.248
I think I'd be honored if you tell me...

235
00:15:55.248 --> 00:15:57.058
when you might be free.

236
00:15:58.117 --> 00:15:59.357
What is the name of the show?

237
00:15:59.817 --> 00:16:01.987
Mi Nu's Happy 6pm.

238
00:16:03.128 --> 00:16:04.597
That sounds like fun.

239
00:16:05.227 --> 00:16:07.528
Do I get to take writers to hotels too?

240
00:16:10.097 --> 00:16:12.138
I never came here with a writer before.

241
00:16:25.778 --> 00:16:26.918
What?

242
00:16:27.717 --> 00:16:30.857
What did he just say?

243
00:16:31.987 --> 00:16:34.227
What did that jerk say?

244
00:16:35.857 --> 00:16:38.058
Ji Soo Ho, you're a jerk!

245
00:16:38.058 --> 00:16:40.128
He's such a fake.

246
00:16:40.498 --> 00:16:43.867
Why won't you believe me?

247
00:16:44.237 --> 00:16:45.668
He went like this.

248
00:16:47.337 --> 00:16:50.178
"I never came here with a writer before."

249
00:16:50.477 --> 00:16:51.937
He was like this!

250
00:16:51.937 --> 00:16:55.107
(Nickname: Rain Cloud, the unlucky one)

251
00:16:55.847 --> 00:16:57.977
- That's so annoying. - Isn't it?

252
00:16:58.317 --> 00:17:01.187
Why not a writer? Is he discriminating us?

253
00:17:01.187 --> 00:17:03.887
(Nickname: Tornado, the fury one)

254
00:17:04.188 --> 00:17:06.827
That's not the right thing to say right now.

255
00:17:07.127 --> 00:17:08.688
But he's not like that.

256
00:17:09.258 --> 00:17:12.798
(Nickname: Drought, the unpopular one)

257
00:17:13.498 --> 00:17:15.367
My friend did the lighting...

258
00:17:15.367 --> 00:17:17.167
for the drama, "Beautiful Night".

259
00:17:17.298 --> 00:17:18.438
I told you, right?

260
00:17:18.567 --> 00:17:21.238
He complimented Ji Soo Ho a lot.

261
00:17:21.667 --> 00:17:24.538
His face shines even without lighting,

262
00:17:24.708 --> 00:17:26.407
but his personality glows even more.

263
00:17:27.748 --> 00:17:29.308
You probably heard him wrong.

264
00:17:29.677 --> 00:17:31.417
Hey, what about Monsoon?

265
00:17:32.018 --> 00:17:34.147
I don't think she can come today.

266
00:17:34.688 --> 00:17:38.018
I heard her main writer talk on the phone.

267
00:17:38.387 --> 00:17:40.587
I think she had a huge fight with her husband.

268
00:17:40.927 --> 00:17:42.387
Gosh.

269
00:17:42.587 --> 00:17:44.528
We're not sub-writers so they can swear at us.

270
00:17:45.228 --> 00:17:47.998
Why are they taking it out on us?

271
00:17:48.327 --> 00:17:50.738
It's nothing new. Cheers.

272
00:17:52.268 --> 00:17:53.938
Did I hear him wrong?

273
00:17:54.367 --> 00:17:57.508
I'm sure he went like this.

274
00:17:58.708 --> 00:18:01.907
Wait. Maybe you did hear him say that.

275
00:18:04.677 --> 00:18:07.117
Then the rumor must be true.

276
00:18:07.288 --> 00:18:08.288
What is?

277
00:18:08.288 --> 00:18:11.087
My friend's ex-boyfriend's dad's cousin's

278
00:18:11.087 --> 00:18:13.728
sister's husband's friend is a reporter.

279
00:18:13.857 --> 00:18:15.427
That's how I heard.

280
00:18:15.688 --> 00:18:18.698
Ji Soo Ho's family is a complete show.

281
00:18:19.597 --> 00:18:20.597
A show?

282
00:18:20.597 --> 00:18:22.897
If Britain has the Beckham family,

283
00:18:23.327 --> 00:18:25.538
Korea has Soo Ho's family.

284
00:18:25.538 --> 00:18:28.867
Don't chase after brands. Turn yourself into one.

285
00:18:29.268 --> 00:18:30.508
Thank you.

286
00:18:30.978 --> 00:18:34.077
Nam Joo Ha is every woman's role model.

287
00:18:34.278 --> 00:18:37.147
Even when I look at my wife now,

288
00:18:37.278 --> 00:18:39.248
- my heart races. - Whenever he talks,

289
00:18:39.248 --> 00:18:41.718
he makes all the men cringe.

290
00:18:41.718 --> 00:18:44.988
The devoted husband, Ji Yoon Seok.

291
00:18:45.258 --> 00:18:47.988
On top of that, their son is a top actor.

292
00:18:48.927 --> 00:18:51.927
He won all the awards there is.

293
00:18:51.958 --> 00:18:53.198
Ji Soo Ho's family.

294
00:18:53.968 --> 00:18:57.698
However, they say everything is a show.

295
00:18:58.038 --> 00:18:59.468
Are you almost done?

296
00:19:00.468 --> 00:19:02.337
I'm finished. I'll come out now.

297
00:19:07.478 --> 00:19:08.748
Ji Yoon Seok...

298
00:19:09.347 --> 00:19:12.417
plays around with all the young actresses.

299
00:19:16.958 --> 00:19:20.327
He checked in at the hotel about an hour ago.

300
00:19:22.228 --> 00:19:25.528
Nam Joo Ha is obsessed with brand name products.

301
00:19:26.558 --> 00:19:29.198
Bring up a nice bottle of champagne for them.

302
00:19:30.198 --> 00:19:31.268
Okay.

303
00:19:32.768 --> 00:19:34.208
That's impossible.

304
00:19:34.938 --> 00:19:38.308
Don't you know it's messier in reality?

305
00:19:38.607 --> 00:19:41.107
Don't believe it if you don't want to.

306
00:19:42.308 --> 00:19:43.948
Do you remember?

307
00:19:44.177 --> 00:19:47.317
Four years ago at JH's donation party,

308
00:19:47.448 --> 00:19:49.887
Ji Soo Ho, that jerk, tripped me.

309
00:19:50.258 --> 00:19:51.387
Yes.

310
00:19:57.657 --> 00:19:59.657
I'm sorry. My legs are too long.

311
00:19:59.857 --> 00:20:03.228
Didn't you just trip me on purpose?

312
00:20:03.867 --> 00:20:05.097
Of course not.

313
00:20:05.468 --> 00:20:07.938
You should watch where you're going.

314
00:20:17.478 --> 00:20:18.677
What was that?

315
00:20:19.248 --> 00:20:21.518
Why is that jerk like that to me?

316
00:20:23.087 --> 00:20:25.617
Geu Rim, I don't know,

317
00:20:25.857 --> 00:20:28.228
but I don't think Ji Soo Ho...

318
00:20:28.528 --> 00:20:30.998
knew you were the same girl from four years ago.

319
00:20:30.998 --> 00:20:32.798
- It was a coincidence? - Yes.

320
00:20:33.498 --> 00:20:35.528
This is insane.

321
00:20:36.367 --> 00:20:39.198
Did I do something to Ji Soo Ho?

322
00:20:40.208 --> 00:20:42.867
- Poor soul. - Maybe you did.

323
00:20:51.147 --> 00:20:53.488
Were you waiting here for me?

324
00:20:53.488 --> 00:20:55.087
Even if you say not to,

325
00:20:55.087 --> 00:20:58.218
it's a manager's job to wait and take you home,

326
00:20:58.657 --> 00:20:59.857
and I'm your manager.

327
00:21:01.157 --> 00:21:02.258
I'll go by myself.

328
00:21:04.927 --> 00:21:06.097
I'll take you.

329
00:21:06.827 --> 00:21:09.927
I smiled and said, "I'll go by myself,"

330
00:21:09.927 --> 00:21:11.867
right? Didn't I?

331
00:21:22.647 --> 00:21:24.248
I'll go to tomorrow's meeting alone too.

332
00:21:24.877 --> 00:21:28.317
Let's meet at the office, not in front of my home.

333
00:21:28.317 --> 00:21:30.218
Okay. See you tomorrow.

334
00:22:40.587 --> 00:22:42.087
What scene is this?

335
00:22:46.798 --> 00:22:49.827
It's Scene 57 from last year's "Shadow".

336
00:22:50.538 --> 00:22:53.067
Someone, please yell, "Cut."

337
00:22:53.367 --> 00:22:56.468
Please yell, "Cut."

338
00:23:10.688 --> 00:23:11.718
Cut.

339
00:23:23.028 --> 00:23:26.367
(Kang Mi Nu Flakes, Talks of Scrapping Show)

340
00:23:35.248 --> 00:23:38.347
This is awesome for migraines. Here.

341
00:23:38.917 --> 00:23:40.117
Take this.

342
00:23:40.587 --> 00:23:42.718
I picked out some lines that may be useful...

343
00:23:42.718 --> 00:23:45.058
for today's show from online articles.

344
00:23:49.357 --> 00:23:51.728
Here's a list of songs that go with the weather.

345
00:23:51.728 --> 00:23:52.728
Here you go.

346
00:23:54.397 --> 00:23:55.468
Where's Mi Nu?

347
00:23:56.528 --> 00:23:58.198
If he doesn't show up for the apology show today,

348
00:23:58.567 --> 00:23:59.998
I'll have to quit...

349
00:24:02.268 --> 00:24:03.407
and fry chicken.

350
00:24:04.938 --> 00:24:07.677
I made sure Mi Nu will stand by...

351
00:24:07.677 --> 00:24:09.708
two hours ahead of time.

352
00:24:12.048 --> 00:24:13.248
That darn...

353
00:24:15.488 --> 00:24:17.317
(Mi Nu's Happy 6pm)

354
00:24:17.317 --> 00:24:19.157
Excuse me.

355
00:24:25.127 --> 00:24:28.298
Why do we need these comments for this?

356
00:24:28.567 --> 00:24:30.298
Who would care...

357
00:24:30.298 --> 00:24:31.867
what the guest is wearing,

358
00:24:31.867 --> 00:24:34.667
or whether they got a haircut or a perm?

359
00:24:35.508 --> 00:24:38.008
Since there are no cameras,

360
00:24:38.008 --> 00:24:41.677
we should help them see what they can't see...

361
00:24:41.778 --> 00:24:43.107
Look at the opening comment.

362
00:24:43.308 --> 00:24:46.147
"It's time for the blue sky to turn red."

363
00:24:46.147 --> 00:24:47.718
Just say the time.

364
00:24:47.718 --> 00:24:50.218
Are you an art teacher?

365
00:24:51.788 --> 00:24:55.488
A radio writer should help listeners draw...

366
00:24:55.728 --> 00:24:57.327
a picture, so...

367
00:24:57.327 --> 00:24:59.798
But you're not a radio writer yet.

368
00:25:00.127 --> 00:25:02.597
Just keep Mi Nu in check, will you?

369
00:25:05.837 --> 00:25:07.367
You're driving me crazy.

370
00:25:10.907 --> 00:25:12.978
I'm hungry. Get me a sandwich.

371
00:25:16.347 --> 00:25:19.548
Let's start on a happy, lively note,

372
00:25:19.548 --> 00:25:21.387
okay, Geu Rim?

373
00:25:21.748 --> 00:25:22.788
Yes, ma'am.

374
00:25:32.127 --> 00:25:33.468
How do you...

375
00:25:33.468 --> 00:25:35.968
always get chewed out whenever you write?

376
00:25:36.427 --> 00:25:38.167
Song Geu Rim. Please.

377
00:25:39.268 --> 00:25:40.738
Darn it.

378
00:25:51.647 --> 00:25:52.718
Namaste.

379
00:25:53.448 --> 00:25:54.617
Namaste.

380
00:25:55.018 --> 00:25:56.087
Namaste.

381
00:25:57.817 --> 00:25:58.817
Namaste.

382
00:26:00.258 --> 00:26:01.288
Namaste.

383
00:26:03.157 --> 00:26:04.228
Namaste.

384
00:26:10.938 --> 00:26:12.067
Namaste.

385
00:26:15.238 --> 00:26:16.978
You're still running food errands.

386
00:26:27.387 --> 00:26:29.548
Right? It is, right?

387
00:26:29.917 --> 00:26:31.387
It's him, right?

388
00:26:31.387 --> 00:26:34.127
That louse. That good-for-nothing louse.

389
00:26:34.488 --> 00:26:35.688
The production director Lee Gang?

390
00:26:40.927 --> 00:26:42.268
(Station Manager: Kang Hee Suk)

391
00:26:42.268 --> 00:26:45.097
Nice lines. Nice song selection.

392
00:26:45.698 --> 00:26:47.038
This is how it should be.

393
00:26:50.837 --> 00:26:52.337
(Station Manager: Kang Hee Suk)

394
00:26:53.077 --> 00:26:54.147
Namaste.

395
00:27:00.048 --> 00:27:01.147
Crazy Gang?

396
00:27:04.317 --> 00:27:06.157
Gosh.

397
00:27:06.387 --> 00:27:08.887
I sent you on vacation to get your act together,

398
00:27:08.887 --> 00:27:10.827
and you came back completely insane.

399
00:27:15.768 --> 00:27:17.238
You know,

400
00:27:17.238 --> 00:27:19.738
the higher ups absolutely refuse...

401
00:27:19.738 --> 00:27:21.837
to permit it because of what happened.

402
00:27:21.837 --> 00:27:24.637
The ones below absolutely refuse to work...

403
00:27:24.637 --> 00:27:28.248
on any program that you do and were flipping out,

404
00:27:28.248 --> 00:27:31.778
but I worked hard to convince them.

405
00:27:32.478 --> 00:27:33.617
Namaste.

406
00:27:34.847 --> 00:27:36.188
Namaste...

407
00:27:36.518 --> 00:27:38.417
Do you think I'm joking?

408
00:27:38.417 --> 00:27:40.728
Your program needs to start,

409
00:27:40.927 --> 00:27:42.857
but how will you staff it?

410
00:27:42.857 --> 00:27:44.458
I will staff it.

411
00:27:45.427 --> 00:27:49.097
You know, all the stars do variety shows now.

412
00:27:49.097 --> 00:27:50.637
No one...

413
00:27:50.637 --> 00:27:54.038
comes anywhere near radio stations.

414
00:27:54.038 --> 00:27:56.367
That's how endangered radio stations are.

415
00:27:56.367 --> 00:27:58.407
This is a serious problem.

416
00:27:58.978 --> 00:28:01.877
So, please get your act together,

417
00:28:01.877 --> 00:28:04.018
and bring up the ratings.

418
00:28:05.778 --> 00:28:07.188
- Mr. Kang. - Yes?

419
00:28:07.488 --> 00:28:09.718
Well... Numbers...

420
00:28:10.048 --> 00:28:11.857
stress people out...

421
00:28:11.857 --> 00:28:13.927
and incite competitiveness.

422
00:28:14.788 --> 00:28:16.258
- Namaste. - Right.

423
00:28:17.327 --> 00:28:20.427
Hey. I like stress and competitiveness...

424
00:28:20.427 --> 00:28:21.968
a lot.

425
00:28:22.427 --> 00:28:24.397
High ratings,

426
00:28:24.397 --> 00:28:26.137
advertisement slots sold out.

427
00:28:26.137 --> 00:28:27.907
What's left without those?

428
00:28:27.907 --> 00:28:28.968
Your name.

429
00:28:29.238 --> 00:28:31.077
Meaning. Emotions.

430
00:28:31.077 --> 00:28:32.077
Why you...

431
00:28:34.748 --> 00:28:36.278
You'd better...

432
00:28:36.708 --> 00:28:38.718
triple the ratings.

433
00:28:39.518 --> 00:28:41.018
Will triple be sufficient?

434
00:28:41.248 --> 00:28:42.788
I should raise it by five times.

435
00:28:42.817 --> 00:28:44.817
That way, the name,

436
00:28:44.817 --> 00:28:46.218
meaning, and emotions will live on.

437
00:28:46.218 --> 00:28:48.927
Goodness. You and your smooth talking.

438
00:28:49.627 --> 00:28:51.498
You big talker.

439
00:28:51.498 --> 00:28:53.968
- Give me some coffee. - Wait, punk.

440
00:28:55.528 --> 00:28:56.938
Yes, hello?

441
00:28:59.367 --> 00:29:01.468
What? What?

442
00:29:02.768 --> 00:29:04.008
Big news.

443
00:29:04.008 --> 00:29:06.978
That legendary Lee Gang is here...

444
00:29:13.147 --> 00:29:14.147
What's wrong?

445
00:29:16.087 --> 00:29:17.258
What's your deal?

446
00:29:18.317 --> 00:29:20.927
You said you made sure Mi Nu would come!

447
00:29:23.288 --> 00:29:24.427
Yes.

448
00:29:24.857 --> 00:29:27.028
He agreed to stand by today, no matter what.

449
00:29:27.028 --> 00:29:28.968
I confirmed earlier...

450
00:29:30.667 --> 00:29:33.337
(Mi Nu Leaving Korea)

451
00:29:43.817 --> 00:29:44.817
(Darn Mi Nu)

452
00:29:45.218 --> 00:29:47.887
Look. Darn Mi Nu is calling.

453
00:29:48.548 --> 00:29:50.758
The reporter got it wrong.

454
00:29:51.857 --> 00:29:52.887
Hello?

455
00:29:53.218 --> 00:29:55.157
Hey, I had an epiphany.

456
00:29:55.927 --> 00:29:58.558
I can't trap my soul...

457
00:29:58.558 --> 00:30:00.058
in that tiny camera.

458
00:30:02.167 --> 00:30:05.468
I will now shed the name "Mi Nu",

459
00:30:06.038 --> 00:30:09.167
break through from the egg of being an idol and a DJ,

460
00:30:09.968 --> 00:30:12.637
and I will fly high!

461
00:30:12.938 --> 00:30:15.407
Hey! Mi Nu!

462
00:30:15.407 --> 00:30:17.647
You'd better prepare your casket today.

463
00:30:22.688 --> 00:30:24.417
- No! - Don't go!

464
00:30:26.157 --> 00:30:29.458
- You can't go! - Don't go!

465
00:30:29.827 --> 00:30:30.958
Bye.

466
00:30:31.458 --> 00:30:33.768
Once I find my true wings,

467
00:30:33.968 --> 00:30:36.127
I'll return to you.

468
00:30:36.127 --> 00:30:39.468
- No! You can't! - Don't go!

469
00:30:43.137 --> 00:30:44.377
Hey, you!

470
00:30:44.978 --> 00:30:46.077
Who's that?

471
00:30:47.147 --> 00:30:48.248
Hey.

472
00:30:50.147 --> 00:30:52.478
I said I'd chase you to the ends of the earth...

473
00:30:52.478 --> 00:30:53.587
if you ruin my show.

474
00:30:54.317 --> 00:30:56.218
I won't do the radio show.

475
00:30:56.218 --> 00:30:58.587
It's humiliating rotting away doing radio.

476
00:30:59.288 --> 00:31:01.288
What? Humiliating?

477
00:31:02.387 --> 00:31:04.298
Don't be like that, sweetie.

478
00:31:04.357 --> 00:31:06.698
I'm not a "sweetie," I'm a writer.

479
00:31:06.698 --> 00:31:08.728
Why don't you show me respect either?

480
00:31:09.067 --> 00:31:11.468
And I told you over and over last night.

481
00:31:11.468 --> 00:31:13.167
A radio show is a promise.

482
00:31:13.167 --> 00:31:15.208
For 2 hours a day, 365 days a year,

483
00:31:15.208 --> 00:31:18.077
you must keep that promise to the listeners!

484
00:31:18.637 --> 00:31:20.248
Come and keep your promise.

485
00:31:22.377 --> 00:31:23.577
- Let go. - Let go!

486
00:31:23.748 --> 00:31:26.077
Who listens to that stupid radio show?

487
00:31:26.147 --> 00:31:28.647
It was to make a comeback after I got in trouble.

488
00:31:28.688 --> 00:31:30.587
Who'd do a stupid radio show that makes no money?

489
00:31:30.587 --> 00:31:31.587
Hey!

490
00:31:32.558 --> 00:31:35.587
It may be a stupid radio show to you, but to me,

491
00:31:35.827 --> 00:31:37.327
it's my entire life!

492
00:31:37.657 --> 00:31:40.298
Who are you to insult it and call it "stupid"?

493
00:31:42.067 --> 00:31:43.998
For the two years I worked with you,

494
00:31:44.097 --> 00:31:45.798
I couldn't write a single show,

495
00:31:46.067 --> 00:31:47.508
because I was always looking for you...

496
00:31:47.508 --> 00:31:48.768
and appeasing you!

497
00:31:48.968 --> 00:31:52.038
Do you know how many soju bombs I made for you?

498
00:31:52.038 --> 00:31:53.577
What do you want from me?

499
00:31:53.907 --> 00:31:56.278
Go and do your show. You can't go!

500
00:31:56.278 --> 00:31:58.077
- What are you doing? - Get off of him!

501
00:31:58.077 --> 00:32:00.018
- What's your problem? - Let go!

502
00:32:00.018 --> 00:32:02.817
- Let go! - Get off of him!

503
00:32:03.317 --> 00:32:05.458
- What's her problem? - How dare you?

504
00:32:10.127 --> 00:32:11.657
Darn it.

505
00:32:22.137 --> 00:32:24.008
Sorry I couldn't keep my promise.

506
00:32:25.407 --> 00:32:27.607
Seriously. This punk.

507
00:32:28.107 --> 00:32:31.278
Sweetie. I mean, Ms. Song Geu Rim.

508
00:32:31.518 --> 00:32:33.377
Shoot.

509
00:32:33.887 --> 00:32:36.617
How could you really go?

510
00:32:37.288 --> 00:32:39.958
Shoot!

511
00:32:54.067 --> 00:32:56.038
What a great closing.

512
00:32:58.607 --> 00:33:00.647
Look what happened to us, thanks to you.

514
00:33:16.228 --> 00:33:19.998
I, Shin Soo Ah, will be filling in for a week...

515
00:33:19.998 --> 00:33:23.637
for Mi Nu's Happy 6pm, due to some circumstances.

516
00:33:23.867 --> 00:33:26.298
I hope you will bear with me.

517
00:33:26.698 --> 00:33:30.308
There are so many people sending comments already.

518
00:33:30.438 --> 00:33:32.677
Hello. It's nice to meet you too.

519
00:33:32.677 --> 00:33:35.978
I hope you will continue to listen until the end.

520
00:33:36.077 --> 00:33:38.218
We have many prizes today,

521
00:33:38.248 --> 00:33:40.617
so stay with me until the end, please.

522
00:33:40.617 --> 00:33:42.788
Let's start with the first song.

523
00:34:10.478 --> 00:34:12.918
(Mi Nu's Happy 6pm)

524
00:34:25.327 --> 00:34:26.967
(Mi Nu's Happy 6pm)

525
00:35:18.717 --> 00:35:21.987
"It's time for the blue sky to turn red."

526
00:35:22.887 --> 00:35:25.518
"Listeners of Mi Nu's Happy 6pm,"

527
00:35:26.358 --> 00:35:29.358
"how long did you look up at the sky today?"

528
00:35:32.358 --> 00:35:34.527
Was this that lame?

529
00:35:34.967 --> 00:35:36.097
Yes, it's lame.

530
00:35:37.568 --> 00:35:38.797
It's crazy lame.

531
00:35:41.568 --> 00:35:43.978
What's his problem?

532
00:35:45.237 --> 00:35:47.447
Oh, I forgot to say hi again.

533
00:35:57.958 --> 00:35:59.588
(Mom)

534
00:36:04.558 --> 00:36:05.827
Hi, Mom.

535
00:36:08.097 --> 00:36:10.867
I made 52 dollars today.

536
00:36:12.097 --> 00:36:14.367
I answered more than 50 calls.

537
00:36:14.808 --> 00:36:15.907
Daughter.

538
00:36:16.108 --> 00:36:18.677
Mom worked really hard today.

539
00:36:20.478 --> 00:36:22.808
An assistant writer makes 1,200 dollars a month.

540
00:36:22.878 --> 00:36:24.577
If you divide it by 30,

541
00:36:25.047 --> 00:36:27.748
I made 40 dollars today too.

542
00:36:28.518 --> 00:36:29.947
But...

543
00:36:30.558 --> 00:36:32.487
I was fired, so...

544
00:36:38.257 --> 00:36:40.097
Is this your first time making a soju bomb?

545
00:36:40.297 --> 00:36:42.628
Who pours soju in like that?

546
00:36:42.998 --> 00:36:46.338
Don't you know you should pour it all at once?

547
00:36:55.947 --> 00:36:57.717
You were fired?

548
00:37:00.217 --> 00:37:01.347
Mom.

549
00:37:01.788 --> 00:37:02.947
What do I do now?

550
00:37:02.947 --> 00:37:05.257
What else? You can play.

551
00:37:05.358 --> 00:37:06.757
How great is that?

552
00:37:11.458 --> 00:37:13.058
I want to get fired too.

553
00:37:14.027 --> 00:37:15.768
Whatever.

554
00:37:18.338 --> 00:37:20.668
You did a great job getting fired.

555
00:37:20.867 --> 00:37:23.367
Trust your mom from now on,

556
00:37:23.367 --> 00:37:25.077
and play. A lot.

557
00:37:25.507 --> 00:37:26.608
Should I?

558
00:37:26.808 --> 00:37:29.047
Should I sleep in and stuff too?

559
00:37:29.677 --> 00:37:32.378
Sleep until your back aches.

560
00:37:32.378 --> 00:37:34.387
That sounds good.

561
00:37:46.498 --> 00:37:48.998
It's been so long since we listened...

562
00:37:49.728 --> 00:37:51.797
to the radio together, hasn't it?

563
00:37:52.237 --> 00:37:55.938
It has. We used to listen together a few years ago.

564
00:37:57.277 --> 00:38:00.347
We weren't able to, once you became a radio writer.

565
00:38:00.777 --> 00:38:01.847
Right?

566
00:38:03.617 --> 00:38:04.748
You're right.

567
00:38:06.077 --> 00:38:08.188
Mom, do you remember?

568
00:38:08.547 --> 00:38:11.788
After your eye surgery, we listened to the radio...

569
00:38:12.117 --> 00:38:13.728
on the bus ride home.

570
00:38:13.827 --> 00:38:15.088
Of course, I do.

571
00:38:15.728 --> 00:38:19.697
The sunset was incredible that night.

572
00:38:34.608 --> 00:38:36.648
Even if you close your eyes,

573
00:38:37.818 --> 00:38:39.577
I'll draw everything...

574
00:38:40.248 --> 00:38:42.947
so that you can see everything.

575
00:38:47.058 --> 00:38:48.128
Mom.

576
00:38:48.228 --> 00:38:52.027
The sky is following us through the window.

577
00:38:53.467 --> 00:38:54.697
But...

578
00:38:55.027 --> 00:38:57.568
the blue sky is changing...

579
00:38:57.568 --> 00:38:59.297
into a red sky.

580
00:39:16.088 --> 00:39:17.318
Back then,

581
00:39:18.058 --> 00:39:21.387
I could see everything you drew for me.

582
00:39:26.458 --> 00:39:29.197
Geu Rim. Draw lots of pretty things...

583
00:39:29.728 --> 00:39:32.438
as you live, okay? Just like your name.

584
00:39:34.407 --> 00:39:35.608
Of course.

585
00:39:35.768 --> 00:39:36.938
You know,

586
00:39:37.338 --> 00:39:40.007
your dad and I ran to the office,

587
00:39:40.478 --> 00:39:42.907
and stayed until they closed...

588
00:39:42.907 --> 00:39:44.648
to come up with your name.

589
00:39:46.077 --> 00:39:48.117
We kept looking at the clock,

590
00:39:48.288 --> 00:39:51.487
erasing it again and again.

591
00:39:51.887 --> 00:39:54.657
Do you understand, Song Geu Rim?

592
00:39:55.157 --> 00:39:57.027
Of course, I know.

593
00:40:00.527 --> 00:40:01.668
Mom.

594
00:40:01.768 --> 00:40:03.597
When I become a program's head writer,

595
00:40:03.637 --> 00:40:05.867
I'm going to write this for the opening.

596
00:40:07.108 --> 00:40:10.077
It's time for the blue sky to turn red.

597
00:40:11.577 --> 00:40:12.737
Everyone,

598
00:40:13.478 --> 00:40:15.507
this beautiful sky...

599
00:40:16.047 --> 00:40:17.347
is next to us.

600
00:40:18.418 --> 00:40:19.478
That sounds cool.

601
00:40:27.288 --> 00:40:28.588
Right?

602
00:40:55.088 --> 00:40:56.217
Hello?

603
00:40:57.788 --> 00:40:59.058
Speaking.

604
00:41:02.487 --> 00:41:03.498
What?

605
00:41:14.808 --> 00:41:15.907
How have you been?

606
00:41:17.777 --> 00:41:18.777
But hey, newbie.

607
00:41:19.878 --> 00:41:21.077
aren't you going to say hi?

608
00:41:22.847 --> 00:41:25.217
Did you have a good time in India?

609
00:41:25.748 --> 00:41:28.847
I'm no longer a newbie. I'm an assistant writer.

610
00:41:30.117 --> 00:41:31.657
I thought you were fired.

611
00:41:31.918 --> 00:41:33.358
Then you're not an assistant anymore.

612
00:41:35.858 --> 00:41:38.858
I heard you were starting a new program.

613
00:41:38.858 --> 00:41:40.797
Yes. I heard too,

614
00:41:41.128 --> 00:41:43.168
that you still stink at writing.

615
00:41:49.137 --> 00:41:51.907
Why did you call me here?

616
00:41:53.077 --> 00:41:54.148
Shoot.

617
00:42:03.347 --> 00:42:04.617
Weight limit exceeded.

618
00:42:06.288 --> 00:42:07.327
Weight limit exceeded.

619
00:42:14.628 --> 00:42:15.628
Hey, newbie.

620
00:42:15.768 --> 00:42:18.268
I heard you gained a new talent while I was gone.

621
00:42:18.268 --> 00:42:20.168
I hear you're gifted at luring in guests.

622
00:42:21.838 --> 00:42:22.907
Yes.

623
00:42:23.108 --> 00:42:26.038
I'm a bit legendary in that field.

624
00:42:26.277 --> 00:42:27.907
Did you hear what happened with Suzy?

625
00:42:27.907 --> 00:42:29.648
Do you know how I got her to come?

626
00:42:31.478 --> 00:42:33.347
Is that what I taught you?

627
00:42:34.117 --> 00:42:35.148
Sorry?

628
00:42:52.568 --> 00:42:54.867
A writer should compete with her writing,

629
00:42:54.867 --> 00:42:56.137
not gain listeners...

630
00:42:56.137 --> 00:42:58.137
by bringing famous guests.

631
00:42:58.478 --> 00:43:00.347
But the writer isn't ashamed,

632
00:43:00.347 --> 00:43:02.077
but rather, is proud of it.

633
00:43:03.918 --> 00:43:06.347
This radio station is going downhill.

634
00:43:06.577 --> 00:43:08.588
What's the use in training juniors?

635
00:43:08.588 --> 00:43:10.588
What's the point in training them so hard?

636
00:43:10.918 --> 00:43:12.257
Excuse me.

637
00:43:12.657 --> 00:43:14.058
You trained me for two months...

638
00:43:14.058 --> 00:43:15.628
and left after causing trouble.

639
00:43:15.628 --> 00:43:17.228
How much did you teach me...

640
00:43:17.527 --> 00:43:19.757
- What was that? - No, no.

641
00:43:20.058 --> 00:43:22.168
Those two months were the most meaningful...

642
00:43:22.168 --> 00:43:24.737
in my entire life.

643
00:43:44.458 --> 00:43:47.088
- Newbie. - I made assistant writer.

644
00:43:47.257 --> 00:43:49.458
- Want to work with me? - Pardon?

645
00:43:50.297 --> 00:43:52.728
You'll be the main writer if you get him to DJ it.

646
00:43:53.327 --> 00:43:55.027
"Him"? Who?

647
00:44:00.208 --> 00:44:01.208
Ji Soo Ho?

648
00:44:02.367 --> 00:44:04.137
- Are you serious? - Yes.

649
00:44:04.838 --> 00:44:06.507
Don't doubt your ears.

650
00:44:06.507 --> 00:44:07.808
You heard correctly.

651
00:44:07.947 --> 00:44:09.007
What...

652
00:44:10.378 --> 00:44:13.018
Really? Ji Soo Ho?

653
00:44:16.487 --> 00:44:18.418
The recent focus for a celebrity's image...

654
00:44:18.418 --> 00:44:21.358
has been being approachable to people,

655
00:44:21.358 --> 00:44:22.788
- so... - Hold on.

656
00:44:24.097 --> 00:44:27.268
What benefit will result by being approachable?

657
00:44:30.068 --> 00:44:32.398
You must be unattainable to make people pay.

658
00:44:33.438 --> 00:44:36.407
What's the use in a star being approachable?

659
00:44:38.808 --> 00:44:41.978
A star must be special and mysterious.

660
00:44:42.407 --> 00:44:43.518
Change your angle.

661
00:44:46.277 --> 00:44:48.248
I must be intellectual and nice.

662
00:44:48.518 --> 00:44:50.188
I must be charismatic like a star,

663
00:44:50.188 --> 00:44:52.018
but be modest as well.

664
00:44:52.018 --> 00:44:53.987
I must be a like a boyfriend, a brother,

665
00:44:53.987 --> 00:44:55.558
and sometimes a CEO.

666
00:44:55.927 --> 00:44:58.527
Bottom line, I must act like a star...

667
00:44:58.757 --> 00:45:00.228
if I want someone to pay.

668
00:45:04.068 --> 00:45:07.108
Please submit all of your proposals today.

669
00:45:07.168 --> 00:45:08.367
I'll look them over.

670
00:45:14.878 --> 00:45:16.878
That's absurd.

671
00:45:17.347 --> 00:45:20.248
We'd be lucky to get him as a guest.

672
00:45:20.248 --> 00:45:22.018
Why would Ji Soo Ho be a DJ?

673
00:45:22.018 --> 00:45:24.617
How could he do a daily program?

674
00:45:25.117 --> 00:45:27.128
- Why not? - What?

675
00:45:27.228 --> 00:45:30.427
Why can't Ji Soo Ho do a daily program?

676
00:45:32.498 --> 00:45:34.527
How does anyone know whether or not...

677
00:45:34.527 --> 00:45:36.737
Ji Soo Ho would do a radio show?

678
00:45:37.867 --> 00:45:39.268
Keep this in mind.

679
00:45:39.268 --> 00:45:41.608
If you get Ji Soo Ho and become my writer,

680
00:45:41.867 --> 00:45:44.308
you'll have to write like crazy.

681
00:45:48.077 --> 00:45:50.447
Ji Soo Ho.

682
00:45:55.887 --> 00:45:57.518
("I like to read and watch movies.")

683
00:45:59.188 --> 00:46:02.188
So he likes spending time alone.

684
00:46:04.998 --> 00:46:06.867
What a boring life.

685
00:46:06.867 --> 00:46:09.467
He eats only low sugar, low carb, low fat foods.

686
00:46:09.827 --> 00:46:10.898
No, no.

687
00:46:11.737 --> 00:46:12.998
(Have some yukgaejang)

688
00:46:14.737 --> 00:46:15.768
Yukgaejang?

689
00:46:19.308 --> 00:46:20.978
This must be his manager.

690
00:46:21.547 --> 00:46:23.007
Even his manager...

691
00:46:23.418 --> 00:46:24.878
looks cold and unapproachable.

692
00:47:19.197 --> 00:47:21.168
Cut! Okay.

693
00:47:21.208 --> 00:47:22.708
Look at this.

694
00:47:22.708 --> 00:47:24.838
I want a flower and butterfly...

695
00:47:24.838 --> 00:47:26.478
He doesn't look well.

696
00:47:26.478 --> 00:47:28.277
That's what I want.

697
00:47:28.547 --> 00:47:30.347
He keeps massaging his temple.

698
00:47:30.347 --> 00:47:31.717
I mean...

699
00:47:33.688 --> 00:47:34.788
Mr. Assistant Director.

700
00:47:35.617 --> 00:47:36.648
Hello.

701
00:47:36.887 --> 00:47:38.617
I'm Song Geu Rim, your college classmate's...

702
00:47:38.617 --> 00:47:41.688
ex-girlfriend's cousin's coworker.

703
00:47:41.958 --> 00:47:42.987
I see.

704
00:47:42.987 --> 00:47:45.327
We'll take a lunch break! The food truck is here!

705
00:47:46.628 --> 00:47:49.027
Sir. Actually...

706
00:47:52.898 --> 00:47:56.878
("Rainy Day")

707
00:47:56.878 --> 00:47:58.077
You should go eat.

708
00:47:59.407 --> 00:48:01.978
Why do you always starve too?

709
00:48:01.978 --> 00:48:05.117
I know you don't eat with the staff.

710
00:48:05.577 --> 00:48:06.887
I can't eat by myself.

711
00:48:17.358 --> 00:48:18.757
We have another crazed fan.

712
00:48:19.358 --> 00:48:20.427
Stay inside.

713
00:48:26.268 --> 00:48:28.168
Give that back! No.

714
00:48:28.168 --> 00:48:29.208
Not the camera!

715
00:48:29.208 --> 00:48:32.108
If you want it back in one piece,

716
00:48:32.308 --> 00:48:33.507
follow me quietly.

717
00:48:38.748 --> 00:48:41.347
Excuse me. Are you inside?

718
00:48:41.447 --> 00:48:43.788
Mr. Ji Soo Ho, are you inside?

719
00:48:45.088 --> 00:48:46.688
I assume you are.

720
00:48:46.688 --> 00:48:48.487
Please excuse me.

721
00:48:54.427 --> 00:48:56.327
Hello, I'm Song Geu Rim.

722
00:48:56.568 --> 00:48:57.637
Do you remember me?

723
00:48:57.637 --> 00:48:59.398
In the hotel elevator...

724
00:49:01.637 --> 00:49:03.938
I'm not sure. Who might you be?

725
00:49:07.978 --> 00:49:10.277
You don't remember me.

726
00:49:10.818 --> 00:49:12.717
I'm Song Geu Rim. I'm a radio writer.

727
00:49:12.978 --> 00:49:14.318
You haven't eaten, right?

728
00:49:14.518 --> 00:49:16.418
I heard you like yukgaejang...

729
00:49:16.418 --> 00:49:19.617
Tea for our star's honey-sweet voice.

730
00:49:19.818 --> 00:49:22.827
Try some. Vitamins are a must.

731
00:49:24.998 --> 00:49:27.927
Mr. Ji Soo Ho. So the thing is...

732
00:49:28.168 --> 00:49:30.697
As a long-time fan who loves you,

733
00:49:30.697 --> 00:49:32.438
I'd like to say a few things.

734
00:49:32.737 --> 00:49:35.467
I know you're super busy with your new drama,

735
00:49:35.467 --> 00:49:38.007
movie, and commercials,

736
00:49:38.308 --> 00:49:40.547
but the busier and more tired you are,

737
00:49:40.547 --> 00:49:42.347
you should communicate...

738
00:49:42.347 --> 00:49:44.018
with your fans, in my opinion.

739
00:49:45.077 --> 00:49:46.217
So?

740
00:49:46.277 --> 00:49:47.347
This punk.

741
00:49:47.347 --> 00:49:49.148
Why does he keep smiling? He's scaring me.

742
00:49:49.418 --> 00:49:50.458
So...

743
00:49:50.458 --> 00:49:52.558
I'd like to offer you...

744
00:49:52.558 --> 00:49:54.588
an incredible opportunity...

745
00:49:54.588 --> 00:49:56.257
to escape the cameras...

746
00:49:56.387 --> 00:49:58.257
and talk honestly in front of a mic.

747
00:49:58.257 --> 00:49:59.257
I won't do it.

748
00:50:00.097 --> 00:50:01.998
Get home safely.

749
00:50:01.998 --> 00:50:03.797
You said you'd do it last time!

750
00:50:04.068 --> 00:50:05.838
In the hotel elevator.

751
00:50:05.838 --> 00:50:07.737
You said to invite you to my show.

752
00:50:08.038 --> 00:50:10.308
I don't remember. Did I?

753
00:50:14.608 --> 00:50:16.208
Do you really not remember me?

754
00:50:16.407 --> 00:50:19.347
You should go. My manager will be back.

755
00:50:19.577 --> 00:50:20.788
You have 30 seconds.

756
00:50:20.788 --> 00:50:22.717
Please, hear me out one more time.

757
00:50:22.717 --> 00:50:25.387
- I won't be your guest. - Mr. Top Star.

758
00:50:25.387 --> 00:50:28.157
Do you think I came to ask you to just be a guest?

759
00:50:28.327 --> 00:50:31.398
It would be a waste to have you as a guest.

760
00:50:31.558 --> 00:50:35.097
We want you to be the DJ for our new program...

761
00:50:35.597 --> 00:50:37.637
Wait! I'm not a crazed fan!

762
00:50:37.737 --> 00:50:39.398
Mr. Ji Soo Ho!

763
00:50:49.608 --> 00:50:50.847
What are you doing?

764
00:50:51.077 --> 00:50:53.588
Why didn't you come to me in my dream last night?

765
00:50:55.318 --> 00:50:57.717
If you can't come into my world...

766
00:51:02.088 --> 00:51:03.288
If you can't...

767
00:51:07.768 --> 00:51:08.867
Cut.

768
00:51:08.998 --> 00:51:10.168
Sorry.

769
00:51:11.237 --> 00:51:12.438
Let's try that again.

770
00:51:12.438 --> 00:51:15.708
What's wrong, Soo Ho? You never make mistakes.

771
00:51:18.208 --> 00:51:19.577
What are you doing?

772
00:51:19.907 --> 00:51:21.108
You...

773
00:51:21.277 --> 00:51:24.018
can never come into the world I live n.

774
00:51:29.248 --> 00:51:32.558
Sorry! I can't do it! It's too scary!

775
00:51:33.288 --> 00:51:34.358
Cut!

776
00:51:34.628 --> 00:51:37.058
- It's too scary. - What's with everyone?

777
00:51:37.058 --> 00:51:38.597
Both of you, seriously.

778
00:51:38.597 --> 00:51:40.027
I'm too scared.

779
00:51:41.967 --> 00:51:43.128
Please.

780
00:51:43.438 --> 00:51:47.168
I'm too scared, and cold, and I'm shaking.

781
00:51:47.608 --> 00:51:50.608
Look at me. Look at my hands and legs shaking.

782
00:51:51.038 --> 00:51:53.338
Guys! Bring me a blanket!

783
00:51:54.407 --> 00:51:56.248
If we try to cut this out,

784
00:51:56.248 --> 00:51:58.248
the writer will run right over.

785
00:51:58.677 --> 00:52:02.148
How can we find a female double now?

786
00:52:02.688 --> 00:52:04.358
This isn't going to work.

787
00:52:04.717 --> 00:52:05.858
Pardon me.

788
00:52:08.527 --> 00:52:10.358
We need to leave in an hour.

789
00:52:10.628 --> 00:52:12.327
I told you before that Ji Soo Ho...

790
00:52:12.327 --> 00:52:14.027
has a commercial shoot scheduled.

791
00:52:14.797 --> 00:52:16.297
I'm losing my mind here.

792
00:52:16.467 --> 00:52:18.237
We need only one more scene.

793
00:52:18.867 --> 00:52:20.038
Please.

794
00:52:55.068 --> 00:52:57.108
It's nice to see you again.

795
00:52:57.237 --> 00:52:58.838
I hope we work well together.

796
00:53:01.608 --> 00:53:02.777
("Rainy Day")

797
00:53:03.077 --> 00:53:04.947
You should've checked which scenes...

798
00:53:04.947 --> 00:53:06.418
needed a double.

799
00:53:06.518 --> 00:53:08.487
Haven't you worked with that picky Da Seul before?

800
00:53:08.487 --> 00:53:10.387
Ji Soo Ho has to leave in an hour...

801
00:53:10.387 --> 00:53:11.518
for a commercial shoot.

802
00:53:12.088 --> 00:53:13.188
What do we do?

803
00:53:18.297 --> 00:53:19.998
Excuse me, sir.

804
00:53:20.827 --> 00:53:21.967
Who are you?

805
00:53:22.498 --> 00:53:26.237
Hello. I'm Song Geu Rim. I'm a radio writer.

806
00:53:29.137 --> 00:53:33.077
I'm his friend's cousin's ex's coworker.

807
00:53:34.077 --> 00:53:37.347
Anyway, I'm a very good swimmer.

808
00:53:37.518 --> 00:53:39.547
I'm about the same height as Da Seul.

809
00:53:39.547 --> 00:53:42.088
Our weight is a bit different,

810
00:53:42.088 --> 00:53:44.157
but Hanboks cover all of that.

811
00:53:44.358 --> 00:53:47.487
Plus, I have a round head, so it looks good...

812
00:53:47.487 --> 00:53:49.527
with a long braid.

813
00:53:51.157 --> 00:53:53.358
I'll fill in for Da Seul.

814
00:54:00.708 --> 00:54:03.478
There's no need to thank me.

815
00:54:03.478 --> 00:54:05.637
We should help each other out.

816
00:54:06.077 --> 00:54:07.478
If sacrificing my body...

817
00:54:07.478 --> 00:54:10.047
will prevent you from being late,

818
00:54:10.177 --> 00:54:12.518
I will become your tool.

819
00:54:13.077 --> 00:54:14.788
Hello, sir. Yes.

820
00:54:14.788 --> 00:54:16.447
If the drama world needs help,

821
00:54:16.447 --> 00:54:17.918
the radio world should help.

822
00:54:17.918 --> 00:54:19.157
If the radio world needs help,

823
00:54:19.157 --> 00:54:21.188
the drama world should help.

824
00:54:21.688 --> 00:54:22.788
Ms. Song.

825
00:54:23.088 --> 00:54:24.197
Yes?

826
00:54:25.858 --> 00:54:27.967
Why are you up in my face?

827
00:54:30.168 --> 00:54:31.168
Pardon?

828
00:54:31.737 --> 00:54:35.608
Why do you keep showing up in front of me?

829
00:54:38.677 --> 00:54:40.847
We'll start shooting scene 57 again!

830
00:54:53.858 --> 00:54:56.058
Ready. Action!

831
00:55:14.378 --> 00:55:16.748
Cut! Geu Rim, let's do that again.

832
00:55:17.217 --> 00:55:18.347
Action.

833
00:55:25.257 --> 00:55:27.358
Let's do that again. Action.

834
00:55:32.297 --> 00:55:33.398
Action.

835
00:55:42.168 --> 00:55:44.077
She's a radio writer?

836
00:55:46.277 --> 00:55:48.577
She's doing that to cast you right now?

837
00:55:50.878 --> 00:55:52.717
Is there some sort of a connection?

838
00:55:55.018 --> 00:55:56.117
Do you know her?

839
00:55:58.558 --> 00:56:00.257
What do you mean?

840
00:56:00.487 --> 00:56:03.597
You haven't read a single page of your script...

841
00:56:03.728 --> 00:56:05.027
and was watching her for 30 minutes.

842
00:56:05.527 --> 00:56:07.827
You'll check how many pages I have,

843
00:56:08.027 --> 00:56:10.597
and how many I read today,

844
00:56:10.867 --> 00:56:12.597
and report back to my mother?

845
00:56:21.248 --> 00:56:22.708
Geu Rim, are you ready?

846
00:56:22.847 --> 00:56:23.847
Yes.

847
00:56:23.947 --> 00:56:25.077
Ready?

848
00:56:25.478 --> 00:56:26.617
Action!

849
00:56:38.358 --> 00:56:39.458
Cut!

850
00:56:41.327 --> 00:56:43.268
Is the video coming out nicely?

851
00:56:43.637 --> 00:56:45.898
- Are you going now? - Yes, I plan to.

852
00:56:48.407 --> 00:56:51.038
But she's pretty incredible.

853
00:56:51.277 --> 00:56:54.248
I know. She jumped in more than 20 times.

854
00:56:54.378 --> 00:56:55.777
She's so good.

855
00:56:58.847 --> 00:57:01.748
Geu Rim, why did you flinch earlier?

856
00:57:02.188 --> 00:57:03.588
Let's try it one last time.

857
00:57:04.617 --> 00:57:06.018
Yes, sir.

858
00:57:15.898 --> 00:57:17.637
We'll try that again. Last time.

859
00:57:18.338 --> 00:57:19.597
Okay. Last time.

860
00:57:23.808 --> 00:57:24.878
Ready?

861
00:57:25.637 --> 00:57:26.748
Action.

862
00:57:49.998 --> 00:57:51.737
Cut! Great job!

863

864
00:59:44.918 --> 00:59:46.378
(Radio Romance)

865
00:59:46.518 --> 00:59:49.847
You say things to anger me and start fights.

866
00:59:50.257 --> 00:59:51.318
Who are you?

867
00:59:51.318 --> 00:59:53.018
We have a secret relationship.

868
00:59:53.018 --> 00:59:55.858
- So? You won't do it? - No!

869
00:59:55.858 --> 00:59:59.297
Stop showing up in my face.

870
00:59:59.527 --> 01:00:02.027
I'm looking for cure other than meds.

871
01:00:02.168 --> 01:00:05.168
I can't back down like this.

872
01:00:05.297 --> 01:00:06.808
When is Ji Soo Ho coming?

873
01:00:06.808 --> 01:00:08.407
Do you want to leave with me?

874
01:00:09.538 --> 01:00:10.878
- Oh, my gosh! - Want to take a shower?

875
01:00:10.878 --> 01:00:12.208
What?
