4
00:00:25.051 --> 00:00:27.536
I don't have any anesthetics,
so I'll have to do this quickly.

5
00:00:27.536 --> 00:00:30.304
If you think this will be too much
for you, please turn around.

6
00:00:31.101 --> 00:00:32.795
I'll be fine.

7
00:00:40.454 --> 00:00:43.057
Have you ever given someone
stitches without anesthetics before?

8
00:00:43.057 --> 00:00:44.665
Of course.

9
00:00:45.484 --> 00:00:46.671
When?

10
00:00:46.671 --> 00:00:47.896
Or maybe I haven't.

11
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.813
You should consider
yourself lucky, Ms. Soo Jin.

12
00:00:56.813 --> 00:00:59.599
My needlework is so good...

13
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.719
that my nickname is Zipper.

14
00:01:03.617 --> 00:01:05.402
Give me just one minute.

15
00:01:06.046 --> 00:01:08.617
I'll make the stitches look
as neat as a zipped zipper.

16
00:01:09.882 --> 00:01:11.242
Oh yeah.

17
00:01:11.242 --> 00:01:13.237
Bite down on this.

18
00:01:13.947 --> 00:01:16.450
The stitches will come out
looking weird if you're too tense.

19
00:01:21.878 --> 00:01:24.114
Don't worry about me.

20
00:01:24.114 --> 00:01:26.462
Just pretend that I'm a bag.

21
00:01:26.462 --> 00:01:27.858
A leather bag.

22
00:01:36.727 --> 00:01:39.280
This is going to hurt a bit.

23
00:02:00.663 --> 00:02:02.292
Okay.

24
00:02:02.901 --> 00:02:04.801
You're doing great.

25
00:02:04.801 --> 00:02:06.717
Oh, you're doing great.

26
00:02:06.717 --> 00:02:08.259
How are you holding up so well?

27

<i>Are you awake?</i>

28
00:02:21.194 --> 00:02:23.759
Can you tell me your name?

29
00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.328
What's your name?

30
00:02:26.995 --> 00:02:28.556
Kim Hye Na.

31
00:02:28.556 --> 00:02:30.481
What about your mom's name?

32
00:02:30.481 --> 00:02:32.736
Shin Ja Young.

33
00:02:34.781 --> 00:02:36.469
We're almost done.

34
00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:38.206
These are the finishing touches.

35
00:02:46.598 --> 00:02:50.048
I told you that
I'd stitch it up really nicely.

36
00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.919
Our breathing was totally in sync.

37
00:03:12.621 --> 00:03:14.609
Were you scared?

38
00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:17.858
I want to go home, Mom.

39
00:03:17.858 --> 00:03:21.914
You... want to go home?

40
00:03:24.073 --> 00:03:26.479
Our house.

41
00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:28.526
The barber shop.

42
00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.699
We have to sleep here tonight.

43
00:03:33.787 --> 00:03:34.963
What's the matter?

44
00:03:34.963 --> 00:03:39.520
Were you scared because the doctor
stitched up my hand with a needle?

45
00:03:43.431 --> 00:03:46.501
It's okay. It's okay.

46
00:03:52.764 --> 00:03:54.246
Is she sleeping?

47
00:03:55.026 --> 00:03:57.177
She just fell asleep.

48
00:04:00.492 --> 00:04:03.228
It seems like it hasn't been long
since you moved into this place.

49
00:04:03.228 --> 00:04:05.487
Well, it's been about two years now.

50
00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.535
I keep telling myself every month
that I need to unpack my things

51
00:04:11.535 --> 00:04:14.432
If I knew you'd be coming,
I would've cleaned up sooner.

52
00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:19.156
All right, now...

53
00:04:19.951 --> 00:04:23.156
I must ask you a couple of
questions, as a doctor.

54
00:04:24.526 --> 00:04:26.884
Are you being pursued
by a dangerous person?

55
00:04:31.103 --> 00:04:32.769
You mean this?

56
00:04:33.444 --> 00:04:37.596
When it comes to this,
I'm the dangerous person.

57
00:04:38.394 --> 00:04:40.999
Nobody did this to me.
I did it to myself.

58
00:04:43.704 --> 00:04:47.475
A woman refuses to go to the hospital
even though her hand is cut open.

59
00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.173
That woman didn't go to the hospital
when her child was ill, either.

60
00:04:51.173 --> 00:04:53.774
And I treated that child and that woman.

61
00:04:54.362 --> 00:04:56.454
As a doctor, I must know.

62
00:04:57.369 --> 00:04:59.447
What have I done?

63
00:05:08.257 --> 00:05:11.634
Did you have both of your parents around
when you were growing up?

64
00:05:11.634 --> 00:05:12.737
Yes.

65
00:05:12.737 --> 00:05:15.132
Both of your parents
were nice people, correct?

66
00:05:15.737 --> 00:05:17.127
More or less.

67
00:05:17.127 --> 00:05:19.708
Did you have a lot of friends
back when you were in school?

68
00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:22.521
I guess you could say that.

69
00:05:22.521 --> 00:05:24.483
Have you ever run away from home?

70
00:05:26.672 --> 00:05:28.319
Is this an interrogation?

71
00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:29.976
Did you eat well?

72
00:05:32.184 --> 00:05:36.755
Have you ever felt apologetic
toward someone every time you ate?

73
00:05:39.694 --> 00:05:43.630
Have you ever cried while dreaming
about sleeping in a comfortable bed?

74
00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.319
I was adopted.

75
00:05:51.413 --> 00:05:55.637
I was abandoned when I was six,
and was adopted when I was eight.

76
00:05:55.637 --> 00:05:58.511
And I barely have any memories
of my birth mother.

77
00:06:01.584 --> 00:06:04.384
I never once thought
that I wanted to meet her.

78
00:06:04.973 --> 00:06:07.704
Because I'm not that
woman's child, anyway.

79
00:06:09.451 --> 00:06:10.951
And...

80
00:06:12.257 --> 00:06:14.865
that woman is not my mother.

111
00:08:09.834 --> 00:08:12.638
I couldn't shake off
these sorts of thoughts.

112
00:08:15.168 --> 00:08:18.274
Every time I put some
delicious food into my mouth...

113
00:08:18.924 --> 00:08:22.922
I thought that the person who'd
given birth to me was starving somewhere.

114
00:08:25.764 --> 00:08:27.451
I guess that...

115
00:08:28.196 --> 00:08:30.765
I pitied her.

When I saw her in person...

120

I felt hatred toward her.

121
00:08:57.403 --> 00:09:00.590
"How could you abandon your
own daughter and run away?"

122
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.202
I wanted to scream that
at her and hit her.

123
00:09:09.094 --> 00:09:10.794
And so, I ran away.

124
00:09:16.625 --> 00:09:18.037
You did the right thing.

125

You definitely will see her again.

00:09:47.594 --> 00:09:50.900
You'll meander around,
then end up seeing her again.

135

You'll meet with her and talk to her.
And you'll meet with her and cry.

where are you?

161
00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:21.936
<i>The attorney told me that they
won't be able to indict me.</i>

162
00:13:21.936 --> 00:13:25.214
If they can't find Hye Na,
the fact that we abused her...

163
00:13:28.597 --> 00:13:31.687
Um, it's hard to prove
that those claims are true.

164
00:13:32.385 --> 00:13:34.432
And apparently, even if
this case goes to court...

165
00:13:35.077 --> 00:13:38.769
the worst sentence I'll get
is being on probation.

166
00:13:40.639 --> 00:13:43.013
Do you know someone named Kang Soo Jin?

167
00:13:43.013 --> 00:13:45.004
No. Who's that?

168
00:13:45.004 --> 00:13:47.225
Isn't she Hye Na's old homeroom teacher?

169
00:13:47.225 --> 00:13:49.514
No, I don't think that was her name.

170
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:56.246
Go find out who Kang Soo Jin is.

171
00:13:57.346 --> 00:13:58.417
Why?

172
00:13:59.109 --> 00:14:00.847
If Hye Na is alive

173
00:14:00.847 --> 00:14:03.245
it won't be good for you.

174
00:14:23.147 --> 00:14:25.148
Did you sleep well, Yoon Bok?

175
00:14:25.687 --> 00:14:27.254
Where's my mom?

176
00:14:27.254 --> 00:14:29.644
She had an urgent matter to attend to,
so she went out.

177
00:14:29.644 --> 00:14:31.505
She'll be back before lunchtime.

178
00:14:31.505 --> 00:14:32.663
You're hungry, right?

179
00:14:32.663 --> 00:14:34.522
Let's eat breakfast. Come here.

180
00:14:35.648 --> 00:14:38.640
I'm not going to eat anything
before my mom gets here.

181
00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:39.787
Why not?

182
00:14:40.375 --> 00:14:42.820
This is super delicious, though.

183
00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:45.313
I guess I'll have to eat this
by myself, then.

184
00:14:45.988 --> 00:14:47.674
What is it?

185
00:14:48.746 --> 00:14:53.360
If you just pour hot water in this,
it becomes tomato spaghetti.

186
00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.755
It's my favorite.

187
00:14:54.755 --> 00:14:56.361
And this...

188
00:14:56.991 --> 00:15:01.975
becomes a hot serving of vegetable
bibimbap if you just pull this string.

189
00:15:01.975 --> 00:15:03.440
It's my second favorite thing.

190
00:15:04.695 --> 00:15:07.359
And these are black bean noodles.

191
00:15:07.359 --> 00:15:11.556
And this is a French military ration.

192
00:15:11.556 --> 00:15:13.799
If you heat it up,
it becomes chicken curry.

193
00:15:13.799 --> 00:15:16.226
Curry? I like curry.

194
00:15:16.226 --> 00:15:17.335
Really?

195
00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:21.039
I guess I'll eat the curry, then.

196
00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:47.140
Doctor.

197
00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:48.251
Yeah?

198
00:15:48.251 --> 00:15:50.267
We've met once before, right?

199
00:15:50.787 --> 00:15:51.821
Yeah.

200
00:15:52.706 --> 00:15:56.125
And back then, you asked me for
my name and my mom's name, right?

201
00:15:56.125 --> 00:15:57.361
Yeah.

202
00:15:58.498 --> 00:16:02.188
My name is Kim Yoon Bok.

203
00:16:02.188 --> 00:16:05.028
And my mom's name
is Kang Soo Jin.

204
00:16:05.678 --> 00:16:08.361
Don't try to find out
anything more about us.

205
00:16:08.361 --> 00:16:11.110
My mom isn't a bad person.

206
00:16:11.711 --> 00:16:14.650
My mom is the most precious
person to me in this world

207
00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:17.136
and I'm more thankful for her
than anything else in the world.

208
00:16:19.614 --> 00:16:20.907
Yoon Bok.

209
00:16:21.594 --> 00:16:23.347
What kind of doctor am I?

210
00:16:23.347 --> 00:16:24.783
A medical doctor.

211
00:16:24.783 --> 00:16:26.073
That's right.

212
00:16:26.716 --> 00:16:31.029
Doctors aren't allowed to tell anyone
what their patients tell them.

213
00:16:31.029 --> 00:16:33.070
That's the law.

214
00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:36.981
So, if I tell that secret
to anyone at all

215
00:16:36.981 --> 00:16:39.000
you can sue me, Yoon Bok.

216
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.230
Really?

217
00:16:40.745 --> 00:16:42.508
What does it mean to sue someone?

218
00:16:43.717 --> 00:16:44.759
Oh.

219
00:16:44.759 --> 00:16:47.565
At any rate, everything we discuss...

220
00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:50.009
will forever be a secret.

221
00:16:50.009 --> 00:16:51.457
From Mom, too?

222
00:16:51.457 --> 00:16:53.027
From your mom, too.

223
00:16:55.895 --> 00:16:58.146
Do you think you'll be able to
have some breakfast now?

224
00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:04.308
Just because I'm eating this

225
00:17:04.308 --> 00:17:07.799
doesn't mean I'll tell you
anything about us.

226
00:17:07.799 --> 00:17:08.992
I know.

227
00:17:11.538 --> 00:17:15.885
I can't choose between
tomato spaghetti and chicken curry.

228
00:17:15.885 --> 00:17:18.669
At times like that,
you have to have both, right?

229
00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:27.653
<i>Ms. Kang Soo Jin?</i>

230
00:17:27.653 --> 00:17:30.741
There isn't anyone by that name
at our school.

231
00:17:30.741 --> 00:17:32.898
Oh, so there isn't?

232
00:17:32.898 --> 00:17:35.551
I see. Thank you.

233
00:17:37.661 --> 00:17:40.461
Honey, they said there isn't
a teacher by that name there.

234
00:17:42.609 --> 00:17:44.909
You know, the teacher
who came by before.

235
00:17:44.909 --> 00:17:46.689
The one who came to
the front of our house.

236
00:17:46.689 --> 00:17:49.180
You mean that annoying woman?

237
00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:52.082
No, the woman who came
with that teacher.

238
00:17:52.082 --> 00:17:53.438
Oh, was there someone else?

239
00:17:54.277 --> 00:17:56.787
Go see that annoying woman

240
00:17:56.787 --> 00:17:59.324
and ask her about Kang Soo Jin.

241
00:17:59.324 --> 00:18:00.801
Do I have to?

242
00:18:00.801 --> 00:18:01.951
Yeah.

243
00:18:21.846 --> 00:18:22.901
Student.

244
00:18:22.901 --> 00:18:25.263
Can you come back tomorrow?
We'll stop for today.

245
00:18:25.263 --> 00:18:26.405
What?

246
00:18:27.239 --> 00:18:29.757
I'll cut your hair
really nicely tomorrow.

247
00:18:31.193 --> 00:18:33.330
Big Bro.

248
00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:35.291
You have a big sister, right?

249
00:18:35.291 --> 00:18:37.557
I can cut women's hair, too.

250
00:18:37.557 --> 00:18:40.111
Bring her here tomorrow.
I'll cut hers for free.

251
00:18:57.376 --> 00:18:59.287
To be honest...

252
00:19:03.153 --> 00:19:04.936
I did wait for you.

253
00:19:07.411 --> 00:19:09.017
For quite a long time.

254
00:19:11.378 --> 00:19:13.913
But I worked so hard
for much longer than I waited...

255
00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:17.683
to get my head on straight

256
00:19:17.683 --> 00:19:20.714
and to stop waiting for you.

257
00:19:21.359 --> 00:19:23.538
I told myself that nobody
was coming to get me.

258
00:19:24.266 --> 00:19:26.623
And that that woman had abandoned me.

259
00:19:27.189 --> 00:19:28.846
That she wouldn't be coming back.

260
00:19:29.711 --> 00:19:33.817
I persuaded myself, consoled myself,
cried, got angry, and yelled at myself...

261
00:19:36.897 --> 00:19:38.752
while my childhood
passed before my eyes...

262
00:19:38.752 --> 00:19:40.970
and my youth passed me by.

263
00:19:41.828 --> 00:19:43.605
And now, I'm here.

264
00:19:51.499 --> 00:19:54.711
Did you think that I would
accept this, ma'am?

265
00:19:55.275 --> 00:19:57.022
Did you think that
I would thank you

266
00:19:57.022 --> 00:19:58.941
and be happy to see you

267
00:19:58.941 --> 00:20:01.710
and ask you if you've been
doing well all these years?

268
00:20:02.301 --> 00:20:04.641
If not, what are you doing here?

269
00:20:04.641 --> 00:20:07.989
If you abandoned me like that, the least
you could be doing is living a good life.

270
00:20:07.989 --> 00:20:10.665
Don't you think that's the very least
you could do for me?

271
00:20:17.532 --> 00:20:19.280
I saw you...

272
00:20:20.263 --> 00:20:21.808
on TV.

273
00:20:23.357 --> 00:20:25.726
It may have been different...

274
00:20:25.726 --> 00:20:27.946
if I hadn't seen who adopted you...

275
00:20:29.587 --> 00:20:31.769
and how you'd been living your life.

276
00:20:32.861 --> 00:20:34.728
But I did see you.

277
00:20:35.423 --> 00:20:36.717
I did.

278
00:20:44.479 --> 00:20:48.459
I was so sure that I could make sure
that you wouldn't find out.

279
00:20:48.959 --> 00:20:51.344
You'd never come to a
barber shop, since you're a girl.

280
00:20:51.344 --> 00:20:54.410
And it's not like I would've
confessed this fact to you myself.

281
00:20:56.167 --> 00:20:57.271
I just...

282
00:20:57.271 --> 00:21:01.019
wanted to see you go to school
and head back home every day.

283
00:21:02.517 --> 00:21:04.657
I just wanted to see you every day...

284
00:21:05.413 --> 00:21:06.759
and see that you were doing well.

285
00:21:08.327 --> 00:21:10.355
That was all.

286
00:21:13.461 --> 00:21:14.798
But...

287
00:21:16.459 --> 00:21:20.858
I had no idea that you'd appear before me
holding a little girl's hand...

288
00:21:21.932 --> 00:21:24.184
and that she'd come running here

289
00:21:24.184 --> 00:21:26.844
to the barber shop
in such frigid weather.

290
00:21:27.717 --> 00:21:29.777
I never would've expected it.

291
00:21:31.461 --> 00:21:32.963
I couldn't...

292
00:21:34.064 --> 00:21:36.358
just throw that away...

293
00:21:37.548 --> 00:21:39.695
but I couldn't use it, either.

294
00:21:41.303 --> 00:21:43.182
So I saved it up.

295
00:21:43.911 --> 00:21:46.075
That is a record...

296
00:21:46.727 --> 00:21:48.788
of how I've lived my life here...

297
00:21:50.392 --> 00:21:52.941
for the past 27 years.

298
00:21:54.943 --> 00:21:56.073
I thought...

299
00:21:57.003 --> 00:21:59.326
that you may need it.

300
00:21:59.326 --> 00:22:02.938
Even if I have to sell the clothes
on my back because I have no money...

301
00:22:03.878 --> 00:22:05.925
I will never accept
your money, ma'am.

302
00:22:06.452 --> 00:22:09.058
And don't say that you lived here
for all this time...

303
00:22:10.355 --> 00:22:12.173
because of me, either.

304
00:22:12.173 --> 00:22:14.500
Because I will refuse
to accept that, too.

305
00:22:25.852 --> 00:22:27.820
Let me ask you just one thing.

306
00:22:32.116 --> 00:22:33.903
Why did you do it?

307
00:22:39.363 --> 00:22:41.327
Did you hate me?

308
00:22:45.252 --> 00:22:47.807
Was your life difficult because of me?

309
00:22:56.854 --> 00:22:59.088
Was it that you were only
able to live your life...

310
00:23:01.031 --> 00:23:03.789
without me around?

311
00:23:12.041 --> 00:23:14.473
I don't remember.

312
00:23:16.596 --> 00:23:19.249
So I keep thinking about it
like a crazy person

313
00:23:19.249 --> 00:23:21.036
over and over.

314
00:23:28.597 --> 00:23:30.019
Tell me.

315
00:23:32.057 --> 00:23:35.567
This is the only thing that
you can do for me, ma'am.

316
00:23:38.116 --> 00:23:39.957
You can't tell me?

317
00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:53.428
I took back the money I gave you
for a month's worth of rent

318
00:23:53.428 --> 00:23:56.184
except the money I owe you
for the four days that we stayed here.

319
00:23:57.766 --> 00:24:00.248
Let's never see each other again.

320
00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:21.246
Thanks to you

321
00:24:21.246 --> 00:24:24.088
I managed to get a really thorough look
inside of a police station.

322
00:24:24.816 --> 00:24:29.227
It'd be good if you were cleared
of all charges, I suppose.

323
00:24:29.227 --> 00:24:32.823
So many people are working so hard
looking for Hye Na

324
00:24:32.823 --> 00:24:37.046
so I'm thinking about taking matters into
my own hands, and searching for Hye Na.

325
00:24:37.672 --> 00:24:39.986
Who's Ms. Kang Soo Jin?

326
00:24:41.234 --> 00:24:42.508
Why do you ask?

327
00:24:42.508 --> 00:24:45.897
You know, the teacher who came with you
when you visited my house last time...

328
00:24:45.897 --> 00:24:48.262
I forced her to come with me,
and dragged her along

329
00:24:48.262 --> 00:24:51.563
since Ms. Kang Soo Jin was
merely a substitute homeroom teacher.

330
00:24:51.563 --> 00:24:53.109
Oh.

331
00:24:53.876 --> 00:24:55.803
So Ms. Kang Soo Jin

332
00:24:55.803 --> 00:24:59.011
was Hye Na's substitute
homeroom teacher. I see.

333
00:25:00.106 --> 00:25:03.382
Yes, but she didn't stay
at our school for very long.

334
00:25:03.382 --> 00:25:06.277
And she had no interest
whatsoever in Hye Na.

335
00:25:06.888 --> 00:25:07.914
How do you know that?

336
00:25:07.914 --> 00:25:10.628
Because the person who was
interested in Hye Na was me.

337
00:25:10.628 --> 00:25:12.963
The one who was worried about her

338
00:25:12.963 --> 00:25:18.066
and the one who contacted the school,
police, and CPS again and again was me.

339
00:25:18.066 --> 00:25:21.172
She may have only been a substitute,
but she was still her homeroom teacher.

340
00:25:21.172 --> 00:25:24.599
Yet, she had no interest
whatsoever in the child.

341
00:25:25.602 --> 00:25:29.269
And she's not even in Korea now, anyway.

342
00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:30.880
Where did she go?

343
00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:32.327
Iceland.

344
00:25:34.919 --> 00:25:36.448
That far?

345
00:25:36.448 --> 00:25:39.584
She left before Hye Na went missing.

346
00:25:40.617 --> 00:25:43.207
She said that she
studied birds, or something.

347
00:25:44.202 --> 00:25:45.446
Oh.

348
00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:48.747
So she studies birds, you say.

349
00:25:56.191 --> 00:25:58.842
I'm heading out now because
I have an urgent matter to attend to.

350
00:25:58.842 --> 00:26:00.372
But I'll be back before dinnertime.

351
00:26:00.372 --> 00:26:01.683
Stay here until then.

352
00:26:01.683 --> 00:26:03.436
We have to go, too.

353
00:26:03.436 --> 00:26:05.773
We were planning to leave, anyway.

354
00:26:05.773 --> 00:26:08.340
Are you planning to go to
a hotel again with Yoon Bok?

355
00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:10.986
Yoon Bok is scared of being here.

356
00:26:10.986 --> 00:26:13.640
I'm going to try and find a place
to stay as soon as possible.

357
00:26:21.169 --> 00:26:23.356
I'll talk to Yoon Bok.

358
00:26:23.356 --> 00:26:26.335
And I'd like to speak to you, too.
Just for a moment.

359
00:26:29.823 --> 00:26:31.553
Do I make you feel uncomfortable?

360
00:26:33.089 --> 00:26:34.945
I'll sleep outside this house, then.

361
00:26:34.945 --> 00:26:37.010
I'm more used to sleeping
at the hospital, anyway.

362
00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:38.259
Doctor.

363
00:26:39.262 --> 00:26:40.842
Right now, I...

364
00:26:42.255 --> 00:26:45.172
want to go where nobody knows us.

365
00:26:46.025 --> 00:26:48.239
I would like it if there
was a lot for me to do.

366
00:26:48.239 --> 00:26:51.746
I would like it if
I were very, very busy.

367
00:26:54.231 --> 00:26:56.340
I'm very worried about Yoon Bok.

368
00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:59.598
That she'll know that I'm not
my normal self right now.

369
00:26:59.598 --> 00:27:02.571
And that she'll think that
I'm angry because of her.

370
00:27:04.622 --> 00:27:07.176
I want to hurry
and show her my normal self.

371
00:27:07.176 --> 00:27:09.042
Yoon Bok is okay.

372
00:27:09.042 --> 00:27:10.767
She's completely fine.

373
00:27:10.767 --> 00:27:12.021
No.

374
00:27:12.021 --> 00:27:14.284
Yoon Bok conceals her true feelings.

375
00:27:15.448 --> 00:27:17.936
<i>She'll say that she wasn't hit
even when she was hit</i>

376
00:27:17.936 --> 00:27:20.717
<i>and lies, saying that she's not
in pain when she actually is.</i>

377
00:27:20.717 --> 00:27:22.958
The one being like that
right now is you, Ms. Soo Jin.

378
00:27:24.148 --> 00:27:28.931
Right now, your mental state is the same
as if you'd been in a car accident.

379
00:27:28.931 --> 00:27:31.330
Your bones are broken
and you're bleeding profusely

380
00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:33.117
and yet you're insisting
that you can walk.

381
00:27:33.117 --> 00:27:35.278
You feel like you can walk
right now, don't you?

382
00:27:35.278 --> 00:27:37.997
But you'll only be able to take
a few steps before you fall down.

383
00:27:37.997 --> 00:27:39.423
Get some rest. Please.

384
00:27:39.423 --> 00:27:40.640
No.

385
00:27:41.236 --> 00:27:43.606
I'm not that badly injured.

386
00:27:44.586 --> 00:27:48.067
I abandoned that woman every day
in my heart, anyway.

387
00:27:49.167 --> 00:27:51.692
It's just that I abandoned her
in real life today, is all.

388
00:27:52.496 --> 00:27:54.550
You said that I wouldn't be
able to walk, right?

389
00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:55.902
You know, I...

390
00:27:55.902 --> 00:27:59.200
can get up tomorrow
and do the exact same thing again.

391
00:28:00.111 --> 00:28:02.011
It really doesn't phase me one bit.

392
00:28:09.873 --> 00:28:13.827
Apparently, she went to study abroad
in Iceland before Hye Na went missing.

393
00:28:13.827 --> 00:28:15.486
Iceland?

394
00:28:15.486 --> 00:28:17.712
<i>Yeah. Isn't that a relief?</i>

395
00:28:21.767 --> 00:28:24.063
The prepaid phone that you see here

396
00:28:24.063 --> 00:28:27.307
can be transferred to
up to four people.

397
00:28:33.645 --> 00:28:37.348
There were three kids in our class
who had cell phones.

398
00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:40.255
But they were the type that
they had to wear, right here.

399
00:28:40.255 --> 00:28:43.592
So the only one who has
an actual cell phone

400
00:28:43.592 --> 00:28:45.310
is me!

401
00:28:46.656 --> 00:28:48.755
I wish I could show everyone.

402
00:28:48.755 --> 00:28:50.413
I wonder what they'd say.

403
00:28:53.009 --> 00:28:55.512
There's something I need to
tell you, Yoon Bok.

404
00:28:56.032 --> 00:28:57.640
Look at Mommy.

405
00:28:59.034 --> 00:29:00.981
Starting from today

406
00:29:00.981 --> 00:29:03.201
we won't be living
at the barber shop.

407
00:29:06.155 --> 00:29:08.162
You're not going to ask me
the reason why?

408
00:29:09.047 --> 00:29:10.960
Is it because of me?

409
00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:12.275
No.

410
00:29:14.433 --> 00:29:18.167
I know that you and that lady
got along well with each other.

411
00:29:19.292 --> 00:29:22.304
That was so nice to see,
and I was so thankful for that.

412
00:29:23.919 --> 00:29:26.924
But Mommy and Barber Shop Lady
ended up fighting a little.

413
00:29:28.368 --> 00:29:32.675
You know that even adults can
fight with one another, right?

414
00:29:40.667 --> 00:29:43.593
Can I call Granny Finger?

415
00:29:45.871 --> 00:29:47.962
I told you this before

416
00:29:47.962 --> 00:29:50.864
but you can only call the number
saved on that phone, which is mine.

417
00:29:50.864 --> 00:29:54.782
You can't call or pick up calls
from other people.

418
00:29:54.782 --> 00:29:56.050
Okay?

419
00:29:57.142 --> 00:29:59.919
Let's stay at a hotel for tonight

420
00:29:59.919 --> 00:30:02.733
and then start looking for a place
to stay at, starting tomorrow.

421
00:30:03.969 --> 00:30:07.732
I won't leave you alone
and go off somewhere anymore.

422
00:30:07.732 --> 00:30:09.809
It's okay even if you leave me
alone and go somewhere.

423
00:30:09.809 --> 00:30:12.054
I have a cell phone now, after all!

424
00:30:12.834 --> 00:30:14.089
At any rate

425
00:30:14.089 --> 00:30:16.601
I'll come back
before dinnertime now.

426
00:30:21.799 --> 00:30:25.223
If you pull the string on this,
it turns into bibimbap.

427
00:30:25.223 --> 00:30:26.856
And I have black bean noodles, too!

428
00:30:26.856 --> 00:30:28.641
I can eat by myself.

429
00:30:30.013 --> 00:30:31.618
All right, thanks.

430
00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:37.604
I'm going to go to the cafe up front
for a bit since I have to meet someone.

431
00:30:41.997 --> 00:30:45.342
Right now, it's 2:54.

432
00:30:45.342 --> 00:30:48.622
I'll be back around
3:20 or 3:30.

433
00:30:48.622 --> 00:30:51.339
Can you wait for me by yourself
until then and play on the swings?

434
00:30:51.339 --> 00:30:52.516
All right.

435
00:31:01.988 --> 00:31:05.140
May I ask you who this is?

436
00:31:12.273 --> 00:31:13.842
She looks like you.

437
00:31:22.133 --> 00:31:25.141
There's still a lot of time until 3:20.

438
00:31:34.239 --> 00:31:35.741
<i>Soo Jin.</i>

439
00:31:35.741 --> 00:31:38.499
I know that you're smart.

440
00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:41.103
And I know that
if you wanted to disappear

441
00:31:41.103 --> 00:31:44.659
you would've definitely
been able to do so by now.

442
00:31:44.659 --> 00:31:46.938
Somewhere I wouldn't have
been able to find you.

443
00:31:46.938 --> 00:31:48.218
Right?

444
00:31:50.741 --> 00:31:51.972
But...

445
00:31:52.482 --> 00:31:55.144
you always came back.

446
00:31:57.142 --> 00:31:59.189
You have to come back on time
this time, okay?

447
00:31:59.787 --> 00:32:02.297
When your issue gets resolved,
come straight back.

448
00:32:02.806 --> 00:32:04.856
If you don't come back
on time this time around...

449
00:32:04.856 --> 00:32:07.022
I'll get really angry.

450
00:32:08.655 --> 00:32:10.820
You understand what
I'm saying, right?

451
00:32:16.307 --> 00:32:18.377
All right, Mister.

452
00:32:20.883 --> 00:32:24.202
So please, take good care of Mom
so that she doesn't pass away.

453
00:32:25.692 --> 00:32:27.699
It's not like your mom
ever listens to me.

454
00:32:33.941 --> 00:32:35.955
Granny!

455
00:32:39.979 --> 00:32:44.979
<font color="#fcc89b">[DramaFever Ver] tvN E06 Mother</font>
<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

456
00:32:49.128 --> 00:32:53.930
"I caught a cold, so..."

457
00:32:57.047 --> 00:32:59.179
Then, I'll do all the talking.

458
00:33:01.894 --> 00:33:04.005
I got a cell phone.

459
00:33:04.929 --> 00:33:07.289
But I can't call anyone.

460
00:33:07.289 --> 00:33:11.269
Mom told me not to
call anyone besides her.

461
00:33:12.564 --> 00:33:16.781
Also, I don't know
anyone's phone number.

462
00:33:16.781 --> 00:33:18.890
I don't know my own
phone number, either.

463
00:33:21.369 --> 00:33:23.855
We'll be leaving soon.

464
00:33:25.965 --> 00:33:30.330
When I'm all grown up,
I'll come see you by myself.

465
00:33:30.851 --> 00:33:33.702
I'll remember how to get here.

466
00:33:39.534 --> 00:33:41.727
I have to go now, Granny.

467
00:33:42.612 --> 00:33:44.092
Bye.

468
00:34:01.164 --> 00:34:02.775
Um, yes.

469
00:34:03.498 --> 00:34:04.498
Yes.

470
00:34:05.059 --> 00:34:06.467
Of course.

471
00:34:13.027 --> 00:34:14.777
Yes, then, just a second.

472
00:34:14.777 --> 00:34:17.110
I'll write it down.

473
00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:18.570
Yes, yes, yes.

474
00:34:18.570 --> 00:34:20.045
Oh no!

475
00:34:21.003 --> 00:34:23.347
Goodness!

476
00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:28.666
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm sorry.

477
00:34:28.666 --> 00:34:31.737
I'll call you right back. I'm sorry.

478
00:34:33.014 --> 00:34:35.572
Damn it!

479
00:34:39.945 --> 00:34:43.063
Damn it, what do I do?

480
00:34:46.474 --> 00:34:48.275
Oh, I'm sorry.

481
00:34:48.275 --> 00:34:50.398
My mind was all over the place.

482
00:34:51.282 --> 00:34:53.925
You're not hurt, are you?

483
00:34:55.168 --> 00:34:58.764
Oh, um, what was that about?
I'm very busy, you know.

484
00:34:58.764 --> 00:35:00.476
- Ugh.
- I'm sorry.

485
00:35:00.476 --> 00:35:03.061
I thought I left my car in park.

486
00:35:03.061 --> 00:35:04.108
I'm sorry.

487
00:35:04.108 --> 00:35:06.494
All right, so hurry
and call your insurance company.

488
00:35:06.494 --> 00:35:07.514
Yes, sure.

489
00:35:07.514 --> 00:35:09.476
I'll call them right now.

490
00:35:09.476 --> 00:35:11.476
I'm sorry.

491
00:35:16.565 --> 00:35:18.099
Hello?

492
00:35:18.099 --> 00:35:19.592
Excuse me.

493
00:35:20.119 --> 00:35:21.927
I want to report an accident.

494
00:35:21.927 --> 00:35:24.177
This guy was the one
who crashed into you.

495
00:35:24.827 --> 00:35:26.215
What?

496
00:35:26.215 --> 00:35:29.989
This guy's car backed
into yours, miss.

497
00:35:29.989 --> 00:35:31.887
You didn't crash into him.

498
00:35:31.887 --> 00:35:35.630
Ugh, I'm so busy as it is! Damn it!

499
00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:37.702
I saw everything.

500
00:35:40.831 --> 00:35:43.309
I'm sorry, I'll call you back.

501
00:35:44.018 --> 00:35:46.398
I'll check my dash cam,
if you don't mind.

502
00:35:51.074 --> 00:35:52.324
Damn it!

503
00:35:53.099 --> 00:35:54.929
That thug!

504
00:35:58.099 --> 00:36:00.425
Yes, hello.
This is the insurance company, right?

505
00:36:01.168 --> 00:36:05.679
This is Jongro-gu, Pyeongchang-dong,
Pyeongchangmunwha-ro.

506
00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:08.204
Which street is this?

507
00:36:09.735 --> 00:36:12.132
- 24th street.
- Oh, 24th street.

508
00:36:12.132 --> 00:36:14.501
Yes, Pyeongchangmunwha-ro, 24th street.

509
00:36:14.501 --> 00:36:16.827
There was a collision. Yes.

510
00:36:18.278 --> 00:36:19.838
Thanks.

511
00:36:19.838 --> 00:36:21.253
You're so smart.

512
00:36:21.253 --> 00:36:22.400
Where do you live?

513
00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:24.083
Um...

514
00:36:24.684 --> 00:36:26.371
Do you live nearby?

515
00:36:27.432 --> 00:36:29.065
The barber shop.

516
00:36:29.065 --> 00:36:31.827
Oh, you mean Samhwa Barber Shop?

517
00:36:31.827 --> 00:36:33.543
You're their child, I see.

518
00:36:33.543 --> 00:36:35.077
No, that's not it.

519
00:36:35.077 --> 00:36:36.811
We're just living there for a bit.

520
00:36:36.811 --> 00:36:38.112
Oh, really?

521
00:36:38.112 --> 00:36:39.693
What's your name?

522
00:36:39.693 --> 00:36:42.824
I'm so thankful, so I want
to send you something.

523
00:36:42.824 --> 00:36:44.228
Um...

524
00:36:52.356 --> 00:36:54.117
Yoon Bok!

525
00:36:54.911 --> 00:36:56.878
Mom!

526
00:36:57.938 --> 00:36:59.530
Big Sis!

527
00:37:16.384 --> 00:37:18.007
Come here, Yoon Bok.

528
00:37:35.378 --> 00:37:37.436
Her name is...

529
00:37:37.436 --> 00:37:39.132
Yoon Bok?

530
00:37:40.512 --> 00:37:42.514
I'm sorry, Hyun Jin...

531
00:37:46.693 --> 00:37:50.804
but can't you keep it a secret
that you met me and Yoon Bok?

532
00:37:51.891 --> 00:37:53.034
Big Sis.

533
00:37:53.034 --> 00:37:57.284
Mom raised three daughters
without a father.

534
00:37:57.284 --> 00:38:01.422
There's nobody else who'd
understand you better than Mom.

535
00:38:01.422 --> 00:38:03.054
It's because I'm running out of time.

536
00:38:03.054 --> 00:38:04.539
We have to leave soon.

537
00:38:04.539 --> 00:38:06.909
As quietly and quickly as possible.

538
00:38:07.690 --> 00:38:09.326
I'll explain things later.

539
00:38:09.326 --> 00:38:12.746
There's nobody who's more
short on time right now than Mom.

540
00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:17.519
Mom may end up passing away
without ever even knowing

541
00:38:17.519 --> 00:38:19.706
that you have a daughter.

542
00:38:21.253 --> 00:38:23.813
You don't know how much
Mom loves kids, do you?

543
00:38:23.813 --> 00:38:27.025
Whenever she sees kids,
her eyes start sparkling.

544
00:38:27.025 --> 00:38:30.784
She's the type to cancel on a live show
just for Tae Mi and Tae Hoon.

545
00:38:31.494 --> 00:38:33.735
If Mom sees Yoon Bok

546
00:38:33.735 --> 00:38:35.500
she'll feel more encouraged to live on.

547
00:38:36.358 --> 00:38:37.838
It's most important...

548
00:38:38.733 --> 00:38:41.376
to maintain her will to
survive, don't you think?

549
00:38:42.079 --> 00:38:43.554
I'm sorry, Hyun Jin.

550
00:38:44.173 --> 00:38:45.858
But Mom wouldn't understand.

551
00:38:45.858 --> 00:38:48.038
Neither would you or Yi Jin.

552
00:38:48.038 --> 00:38:50.804
Because even I can't understand
the situation I'm in right now.

553
00:38:50.804 --> 00:38:52.987
The only thing that I know for sure

554
00:38:52.987 --> 00:38:55.451
is that I must take that child

555
00:38:55.451 --> 00:38:58.043
and go far, far away from here.

556
00:39:00.664 --> 00:39:02.266
All right.

557
00:39:03.534 --> 00:39:07.244
I do understand how you must feel.

558
00:39:07.931 --> 00:39:11.244
But, I'm a reporter.

559
00:39:11.244 --> 00:39:14.855
I'm just naturally bad at saying
I haven't seen something that I've seen.

560
00:39:15.824 --> 00:39:18.699
You've asked me to do
something that's too difficult.

561
00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:45.884
Have we been exposed now?

562
00:39:47.711 --> 00:39:49.268
No, we're okay.

563
00:39:49.268 --> 00:39:50.686
Don't worry about it.

564
00:39:50.686 --> 00:39:52.768
I'm sorry.

565
00:39:52.768 --> 00:39:55.061
You didn't do anything wrong.

566
00:39:55.061 --> 00:39:56.847
Everything will be fine.

567
00:39:56.847 --> 00:39:59.570
I have to go somewhere.

568
00:40:00.987 --> 00:40:04.427
And I'll be back by 4:30.

569
00:40:04.427 --> 00:40:06.168
Stay here and eat.

570
00:40:06.168 --> 00:40:07.925
Let's go eat dinner
together after I get back.

571
00:40:07.925 --> 00:40:10.157
I'll leave my bag and my coffee here

572
00:40:10.157 --> 00:40:13.605
so if someone asks, tell them
that I went to the bathroom.

573
00:40:13.605 --> 00:40:16.163
And if anything happens, call me.

574
00:40:16.891 --> 00:40:18.331
Can you do that?

575
00:40:18.331 --> 00:40:21.485
All right. Have a good time
in the bathroom.

576
00:40:25.001 --> 00:40:26.590
I'm home.

577
00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:28.083
Oh, hey.

578
00:40:28.083 --> 00:40:29.202
Oh, you're back?

579
00:40:29.202 --> 00:40:30.965
Eat this.

580
00:40:30.965 --> 00:40:32.896
- Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!
- Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

581
00:40:32.896 --> 00:40:34.666
Yum, that's good.

582
00:40:34.666 --> 00:40:37.306
Mom ordered beef from Hoengseong.

583
00:40:37.306 --> 00:40:39.367
She wants to make sure she's
well-fed before she goes abroad.

584
00:40:39.367 --> 00:40:41.563
They don't have braised short ribs
abroad, after all.

585
00:40:48.983 --> 00:40:50.443
I'm here.

586
00:40:50.443 --> 00:40:52.697
Oh, you're here?
Your eldest aunt is here.

587
00:40:52.697 --> 00:40:54.804
- Hello.
- Hello.

588
00:40:54.804 --> 00:40:55.840
Hey.

589
00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:57.632
You came earlier than expected.

590
00:40:57.632 --> 00:40:59.400
It needs to cook a bit longer.

591
00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.568
It's delicious.

592
00:41:15.914 --> 00:41:18.224
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

593
00:41:18.224 --> 00:41:21.898
Don't you think she's suddenly
being way too nice to you?

594
00:41:21.898 --> 00:41:24.967
I feel like she's putting on airs
as a future chairwoman.

595
00:41:24.967 --> 00:41:26.471
What do you mean by that?

596
00:41:26.471 --> 00:41:28.945
You don't know since you
left early yesterday

597
00:41:28.945 --> 00:41:31.625
but Yi Ji will become a chairwoman.

598
00:41:31.625 --> 00:41:34.726
Ask our attorney when you next see him.

599
00:41:35.918 --> 00:41:37.016
Mom.

600
00:41:37.016 --> 00:41:39.666
I don't think I'll be able to
eat dinner with you all today.

601
00:41:39.666 --> 00:41:40.936
Why not?

602
00:41:58.019 --> 00:42:02.217
Mom said that she'd be here at 4:30.

603
00:42:02.217 --> 00:42:05.795
And it's 4:05 right now.

604
00:42:05.795 --> 00:42:08.391
So, the amount of time there is
left until she gets back is...

605
00:42:09.347 --> 00:42:10.733
um...

606
00:42:15.204 --> 00:42:17.521
One, two minutes...

607
00:42:17.521 --> 00:42:21.153
three, four, five...

608
00:42:21.153 --> 00:42:22.431
six...

609
00:42:22.914 --> 00:42:26.210
Something urgent came up,
so I have to go.

610
00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:27.597
And...

611
00:42:28.226 --> 00:42:30.387
as for the time that
we meet each other

612
00:42:30.387 --> 00:42:33.204
- let's meet earlier from now on...
- Soo Jin.

613
00:42:33.204 --> 00:42:35.806
You have to tell me
what the urgent matter is.

614
00:42:35.806 --> 00:42:40.510
Everyone got together at this time
today so we could have dinner with you.

615
00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:43.967
So if you can't tell us why
you can't stay

616
00:42:43.967 --> 00:42:47.072
that would be too rude of you.

617
00:42:47.711 --> 00:42:50.599
Wait, you're going to leave
without eating?

618
00:42:51.465 --> 00:42:52.485
I'm sorry.

619
00:42:52.485 --> 00:42:54.617
What are you saying?
Just have a bite, at least.

620
00:42:54.617 --> 00:42:56.795
It's not like it'll take you
several hours to eat.

621
00:42:56.795 --> 00:42:59.559
Yeah, and tell us what this
"urgent matter" is.

622
00:43:14.452 --> 00:43:16.010
Doctor Jung?

623
00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:17.523
What is it?

624
00:43:19.121 --> 00:43:21.349
Wait, you're on your way
to our place right now?

625
00:43:23.686 --> 00:43:26.340
What? You want to know if it's
okay if you take Soo Jin?

626
00:43:27.257 --> 00:43:28.844
When?

627
00:43:29.547 --> 00:43:31.257
Where are you going?

628
00:43:31.952 --> 00:43:33.688
You're going on a drive

629
00:43:33.688 --> 00:43:35.998
and then going to eat dinner afterward?

630
00:43:40.690 --> 00:43:43.804
So you did have an urgent matter
that you couldn't tell me about.

631
00:43:44.324 --> 00:43:45.431
Eat before you go.

632
00:43:45.431 --> 00:43:48.163
Doctor Jung can eat first, too.
I've made more than enough.

633
00:43:48.163 --> 00:43:49.211
Hey.

634
00:43:49.211 --> 00:43:52.373
What's more important right now?
Short ribs or a man?

635
00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:55.326
You did even worse things
when you were younger.

636
00:43:56.699 --> 00:43:58.434
Hurry and go.

637
00:44:04.492 --> 00:44:05.753
Soo Jin.

638
00:44:05.753 --> 00:44:07.139
Get in.

639
00:44:19.726 --> 00:44:21.492
<i>Oh, goodness me.</i>

640
00:44:21.492 --> 00:44:23.556
Look at her,
just getting in like it's nothing.

641
00:44:23.556 --> 00:44:25.896
They don't seem to have
an ordinary relationship.

642
00:44:28.844 --> 00:44:30.025
I'm sorry.

643
00:44:30.025 --> 00:44:31.385
I surprised you, didn't I?

644
00:44:32.050 --> 00:44:33.481
Yes, I was surprised.

645
00:44:33.481 --> 00:44:36.679
There's a place I really
need to go with you right now.

646
00:44:36.679 --> 00:44:38.809
But there was no way for me
to contact you sooner.

647
00:44:38.809 --> 00:44:40.882
And we can't be late.

648
00:44:40.882 --> 00:44:42.166
Where are we going?

649
00:44:42.166 --> 00:44:43.628
Um...

650
00:44:43.628 --> 00:44:45.985
it's somewhere I go often in
the evening, on weekends.

651
00:44:45.985 --> 00:44:48.626
And sometimes I spend
the night there, too.

652
00:44:50.188 --> 00:44:51.802
Where's Yoon Bok?

653
00:44:53.623 --> 00:44:56.472
What kind of relationship do
Doctor Jung and Big Sis have?

654
00:44:56.472 --> 00:44:58.809
I'm not really sure.

655
00:44:58.809 --> 00:45:01.972
They have met up three times
just this week, though.

656
00:45:01.972 --> 00:45:03.186
What?

657
00:45:03.659 --> 00:45:05.282
You really are amazing, Mom.

658
00:45:05.282 --> 00:45:07.496
You go out of your way to
find your daughter a husband

659
00:45:07.496 --> 00:45:09.322
even when you're so ill.

660
00:45:09.322 --> 00:45:11.112
Thanks to that,
you managed to get married.

661
00:45:11.112 --> 00:45:12.739
Yeah, but it's not a happy marriage.

662
00:45:13.847 --> 00:45:15.934
There's no such thing
as a happy marriage.

663
00:45:15.934 --> 00:45:18.907
It's good enough that you
gave birth to such cute pups.

664
00:45:18.907 --> 00:45:21.280
- They don't suit each other.
- What are you talking about?

665
00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:23.293
How old is Doctor Jung, again?

666
00:45:23.293 --> 00:45:25.626
- Isn't he younger?
- What are you saying?

667
00:45:25.626 --> 00:45:28.157
Soo Jin definitely looks
younger than him.

668
00:45:28.157 --> 00:45:31.322
It's a bit strange that a doctor
his age is still not married, too.

669
00:45:31.322 --> 00:45:34.561
If he were half decent, some woman
would've snatched him away by now.

670
00:45:35.947 --> 00:45:38.213
Maybe Doctor Jung has issues?

671
00:45:39.039 --> 00:45:40.556
We managed to get here just in time.

672
00:45:40.556 --> 00:45:43.282
We have to go in before the sun sets
and grab ourselves a spot.

673
00:45:43.282 --> 00:45:45.735
The evening migration will start soon.

674
00:45:45.735 --> 00:45:50.092
When that's over, the oriental
greenfinches will be the first to come.

675
00:45:50.092 --> 00:45:53.621
Then, the meadow buntings.
And then the woodpeckers.

676
00:45:54.275 --> 00:45:56.237
And when it gets quiet...

677
00:45:56.237 --> 00:45:57.931
take a good look.

678
00:45:57.931 --> 00:46:00.137
The solitary snipes might even come out.

679
00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:03.434
A solitary snipe?

680
00:46:04.318 --> 00:46:08.164
They say that it takes three generations'
worth of effort to see a solitary snipe

681
00:46:08.164 --> 00:46:11.327
but I've seen them here for three years
straight now, right around this time.

682
00:46:11.327 --> 00:46:14.219
There's a valley if we walk
a bit more up from here.

683
00:46:14.219 --> 00:46:16.135
And there's a flat boulder near there.

684
00:46:16.135 --> 00:46:17.849
Sit right there, and don't move.

685
00:46:17.849 --> 00:46:20.597
The birds start moving around 30 minutes
before the sun sets.

686
00:46:22.672 --> 00:46:24.949
Hm, you should get going now.

687
00:46:26.074 --> 00:46:27.559
You want me to go alone?

688
00:46:27.559 --> 00:46:29.338
Just stay there for
30 minutes and come back.

689
00:46:29.338 --> 00:46:32.505
All by yourself, in a place
where nobody can find you.

690
00:46:35.032 --> 00:46:36.452
Yoon Bok.

691
00:46:36.452 --> 00:46:39.657
You're okay with being with me
while your mom goes there, right?

692
00:46:40.672 --> 00:46:42.492
Have fun, Mom.

693
00:47:19.322 --> 00:47:24.159
<i>There was a baby rabbit
that wanted to run away.</i>

694
00:47:25.112 --> 00:47:28.289
<i>"I'm going to run away, Mom."</i>

695
00:47:29.559 --> 00:47:33.391
<i>"I'll chase after you
if you run away."</i>

696
00:47:34.347 --> 00:47:37.168
<i>"Because you are my adorable child."</i>

697
00:47:37.985 --> 00:47:40.019
"If you follow me, Mom"

698
00:47:40.019 --> 00:47:43.320
"I'll go to the riverside
and become a fish."

699
00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:46.512
"And I'll swim away."

700
00:47:46.512 --> 00:47:49.889
"If you go to the riverside
and become a fish"

701
00:47:49.889 --> 00:47:52.327
"I'll become a fisherman."

702
00:47:52.327 --> 00:47:54.896
"Then, I'll catch you."

703
00:48:06.429 --> 00:48:09.164
<i>"If you become
a fisherman, Mom"</i>

704
00:48:09.164 --> 00:48:12.335
<i>"I'll go to a mountain that is
much higher than the one you're at"</i>

705
00:48:12.335 --> 00:48:14.552
<i>"and become a rock."</i>

706
00:48:16.757 --> 00:48:20.795
<i>I'm going to give
everything to this child.</i>

707
00:48:20.795 --> 00:48:23.251
<i>I will give many,
many things to this child.</i>

708
00:48:23.876 --> 00:48:25.146
<i>Until...</i>

709
00:48:25.146 --> 00:48:27.610
<i>the child forgets about all
of her old scars completely.</i>

710
00:48:28.693 --> 00:48:31.251
<i>That is quite important to me.</i>

711
00:48:31.251 --> 00:48:32.353
<i>Because...</i>

712
00:48:32.353 --> 00:48:34.768
<i>that is a matter that
involves my very soul.</i>

713
00:48:36.474 --> 00:48:40.586
"If you go to a high mountaintop
and become a rock"

714
00:48:40.586 --> 00:48:43.282
"I will become a hiker."

715
00:48:43.282 --> 00:48:46.760
"Then, I will climb up
to where you are."

716
00:48:47.398 --> 00:48:48.780
<i>No.</i>

717
00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:51.829
<i>I don't need a lot of things.</i>

718
00:48:52.297 --> 00:48:54.862
<i>Getting things like that makes me think</i>

719
00:48:54.862 --> 00:48:57.184
<i>that the mother who gave birth to me</i>

720
00:48:57.184 --> 00:49:00.420
<i>may have abandoned me because
she couldn't give me these things.</i>

721
00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:03.481
<i>But I can live without
these sorts of things.</i>

722
00:49:37.856 --> 00:49:39.838
<i>I'm sure that the person
who abandoned Soo Jin</i>

723
00:49:39.838 --> 00:49:41.985
<i>had her own reasons for doing so.</i>

724
00:49:48.030 --> 00:49:51.873
<i>But when I think about
how my child was abandoned</i>

725
00:49:51.873 --> 00:49:55.204
<i>my desire to be understanding of her
circumstances completely vanishes.</i>

726
00:49:56.233 --> 00:49:59.079
<i>The child had wounds all over her body</i>

727
00:49:59.079 --> 00:50:01.108
<i>and she was tied down with a lock</i>

728
00:50:01.108 --> 00:50:03.472
<i>so that she couldn't escape.</i>

729
00:50:03.472 --> 00:50:06.639
<i>The only acceptable excuse to me</i>

730
00:50:06.639 --> 00:50:08.150
<i>that I could be understanding of...</i>

731
00:50:08.853 --> 00:50:10.717
<i>is that she died.</i>

732
00:50:12.164 --> 00:50:13.739
<i>If that were the case...</i>

733
00:50:14.498 --> 00:50:19.760
<i>I could say, "Oh, so that's why she
could no longer raise the child."</i>

734
00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:22.885
<i>and understand why
she did what she did.</i>

735
00:50:31.909 --> 00:50:35.702
<i>"I'll become a bird and fly
far, far away."</i>

736
00:50:35.702 --> 00:50:38.498
<i>If this goes on TV</i>

737
00:50:38.498 --> 00:50:41.175
<i>will everyone be able to see me?</i>

738
00:50:41.175 --> 00:50:44.213
<i>Everyone in this country
will be able to see you.</i>

739
00:50:44.213 --> 00:50:47.628
<i>Is there anyone that
you hope will see you?</i>

740
00:50:49.554 --> 00:50:52.795
<i>What do you want them
to see about you, exactly?</i>

741
00:50:55.706 --> 00:50:58.505
<i>That I'm doing well.</i>

742
00:51:00.938 --> 00:51:04.806
<i>"If you become a bird
and fly far, far away"</i>

743
00:51:04.806 --> 00:51:07.054
<i>"I will become a tree"</i>

744
00:51:07.054 --> 00:51:09.628
<i>"and wait for you here."</i>

745
00:51:10.481 --> 00:51:12.286
<i>"Forever."</i>

746
00:51:29.938 --> 00:51:32.297
<i>I'm doing well.</i>

747
00:51:52.222 --> 00:51:53.972
Are you taking customers?

748
00:51:55.050 --> 00:51:57.590
Of course. Come on in.

749
00:52:00.155 --> 00:52:03.108
What are their names?

750
00:52:04.626 --> 00:52:08.347
One of them is named Soo,
and the other one is named Jin.

751
00:52:08.347 --> 00:52:10.635
Oh, Soo and Jin.

752
00:52:14.396 --> 00:52:15.543
Oh, goodness.

753
00:52:15.543 --> 00:52:17.981
I have to feed them.

754
00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:23.844
Oh no!

755
00:52:23.844 --> 00:52:25.800
The birds need to be fed.

756
00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:26.920
Huh?

757
00:52:27.572 --> 00:52:30.336
I forgot to return the key
for the bird cage to her.

758
00:52:31.639 --> 00:52:33.920
Even though I was the one
who was in charge of the birds.

759
00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:35.737
Yoon Bok!

760
00:52:35.737 --> 00:52:37.456
Mom!

761
00:52:42.065 --> 00:52:44.190
Did you have a good time, Mom?

762
00:52:45.539 --> 00:52:47.173
Did you have a good time?

763
00:52:53.599 --> 00:52:55.945
Big Sis has a kid?

764
00:52:55.945 --> 00:53:00.021
She wants me to keep it
a secret from Mom.

765
00:53:00.795 --> 00:53:02.929
But I don't think I should.

766
00:53:03.179 --> 00:53:05.483
Big Sis has a kid?

767
00:53:05.978 --> 00:53:09.704
She wants me to keep it
a secret from Mom.

768
00:53:10.434 --> 00:53:12.896
But I don't think I should.

769
00:53:12.896 --> 00:53:14.711
Why not?

770
00:53:15.568 --> 00:53:18.918
Mom will be so happy
if she sees that child.

771
00:53:19.438 --> 00:53:23.005
At this rate, she'll pass away without
knowing that Big Sis has a daughter.

772
00:53:23.005 --> 00:53:26.713
Why do you think that we were unaware of
the fact that she had a kid up until now?

773
00:53:27.356 --> 00:53:31.456
If she had a proper child, then we
would've known about her by now.

774
00:53:31.456 --> 00:53:34.291
What if Big Sis is some
married guy's side chick?

775
00:53:34.291 --> 00:53:37.152
You think that Mom will be happy to
find out that she's a home wrecker

776
00:53:37.152 --> 00:53:40.103
and is on the run with a kid, when
she raised Big Sis with so much care?

777
00:53:40.811 --> 00:53:44.304
Even the strongest parents
will crumble if they find out

778
00:53:44.304 --> 00:53:46.534
that their daughter did
something horrific.

779
00:53:46.534 --> 00:53:49.748
Yet, you think Mom will be
happy, despite this situation?

780
00:53:50.978 --> 00:53:52.333
What do I do?

781
00:53:52.333 --> 00:53:54.974
What do you mean?
Keep quiet about it, of course.

782
00:53:54.974 --> 00:53:57.210
We have to keep it hidden,
and send them off well.

783
00:53:59.666 --> 00:54:02.967
Wow, I really can't believe Soo Jin.

784
00:54:02.967 --> 00:54:05.184
She was talking as if she had
no intention of ever having kids

785
00:54:05.184 --> 00:54:07.293
when we were discussing
the inheritance yesterday!

786
00:54:15.099 --> 00:54:17.550
Here I come!

787
00:54:20.010 --> 00:54:23.552
Why are Mom and Auntie
talking over there, when it's cold?

788
00:54:23.552 --> 00:54:26.074
Mom and Auntie are talking?

789
00:54:26.074 --> 00:54:28.577
Those two usually
don't talk to each other.

790
00:54:30.237 --> 00:54:34.306
<i>We usually go to that spot when
we're discussing secret matters.</i>

791
00:54:39.157 --> 00:54:40.210
Honey.

792
00:54:40.210 --> 00:54:42.282
Do you know where Iceland is?

793
00:54:44.014 --> 00:54:45.619
It's at the edge of the earth.

794
00:54:48.983 --> 00:54:51.376
I think it'll be fine, honestly.

795
00:54:51.376 --> 00:54:53.813
Even if that woman
Kang Soo Jin took Hye Na

796
00:54:53.813 --> 00:54:56.206
if the two of them are in
Iceland, well, then...

797
00:54:58.393 --> 00:55:00.597
Why did they say that she
went to Iceland, again?

798
00:55:01.726 --> 00:55:03.661
To study.

799
00:55:03.661 --> 00:55:05.786
What did she say that
she was studying, again?

800
00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:07.976
Birds?

801
00:55:23.869 --> 00:55:25.074
Honey.

802
00:55:26.373 --> 00:55:28.344
Let's have a nice life now.

803
00:55:30.791 --> 00:55:33.583
It's just the two of us now.

804
00:55:44.101 --> 00:55:46.987
What are you plotting with Soo Jin?

805
00:55:46.987 --> 00:55:48.688
She'll be leaving soon.

806
00:55:48.688 --> 00:55:50.164
That's all I can tell you.

807
00:55:50.164 --> 00:55:51.813
When is she leaving?

808
00:55:51.813 --> 00:55:54.030
In about two weeks or so.

809
00:55:54.030 --> 00:55:58.155
If she wants to leave, she should hurry.
Why is she here for another two weeks?

810
00:55:58.753 --> 00:56:00.789
Is there a problem?

811
00:56:01.335 --> 00:56:03.900
I'll tell you later.

812
00:56:04.829 --> 00:56:07.797
She's a home wrecker,
and a single mom, to boot?

813
00:56:07.797 --> 00:56:11.541
Wow, Soo Jin really is hopeless.
I didn't think she was like that.

814
00:56:13.481 --> 00:56:15.820
No, that's not what happened.

815
00:56:26.157 --> 00:56:27.481
Yes, Madam?

816
00:56:36.579 --> 00:56:39.943
Can't we stop by the barber shop, Mom?

817
00:56:39.943 --> 00:56:41.045
Why?

818
00:56:41.045 --> 00:56:44.135
I took the key for
the bird cage by accident.

819
00:56:44.135 --> 00:56:46.648
Granny won't be able to feed them.

820
00:57:23.719 --> 00:57:25.702
I'm sorry, Mom.

821
00:57:26.599 --> 00:57:27.713
All right.

822
00:57:27.713 --> 00:57:29.599
Tell me your side of the story now.

823
00:57:31.434 --> 00:57:36.887
I kept thinking that I should
have told you about this.

824
00:57:38.231 --> 00:57:41.871
But I'm sure that Soo Jin
has her own reasons.

825
00:57:43.878 --> 00:57:44.990
<i>Hey.</i>

826
00:57:48.030 --> 00:57:49.228
Yes.

827
00:57:49.789 --> 00:57:52.487
I'm sure that Soo Jin
has her own reasons.

828
00:57:52.487 --> 00:57:54.773
But that's Soo Jin's problem.

829
00:57:54.773 --> 00:57:57.824
When were you planning
to tell me about this, then?

830
00:57:59.972 --> 00:58:02.175
First, Soo Jin...

831
00:58:03.164 --> 00:58:06.362
would have to have made all the
preparations to move with the child...

832
00:58:13.130 --> 00:58:14.592
So...

833
00:58:15.635 --> 00:58:19.083
Soo Jin has a child?

834
00:58:52.981 --> 00:58:54.514
Those little...

835
00:59:02.367 --> 00:59:04.231
Granny!

836
00:59:06.956 --> 00:59:08.947
Oh my word.

837
00:59:08.947 --> 00:59:10.735
Oh... my goodness.

838
00:59:15.231 --> 00:59:16.704
Goodness.

839
00:59:26.012 --> 00:59:28.315
You should feed them now, Granny.

840
00:59:28.315 --> 00:59:30.521
I'm sure that they must have been hungry.

841
00:59:32.056 --> 00:59:35.313
But is your cold
all better now, Granny?

842
00:59:46.943 --> 00:59:48.541
Thank you for everything.

843
00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:51.534
Let's go again sometime.

844
00:59:51.534 --> 00:59:53.391
Can we?

845
00:59:54.478 --> 00:59:55.925
Let's go tomorrow.

846
00:59:57.088 --> 00:59:59.438
Because I have to go to work on Monday.

847
01:00:01.574 --> 01:00:03.007
Sure.

848
01:00:05.954 --> 01:00:08.400
Is it because of me that you're
not going in to say hello?

849
01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:09.842
No.

850
01:01:01.090 --> 01:01:02.527
Yoon Bok.

851
01:01:02.527 --> 01:01:03.884
Let's get going now.

852
01:01:03.884 --> 01:01:05.300
All right.

853
01:01:37.235 --> 01:01:39.661
Oh my goodness!

854
01:01:45.070 --> 01:01:47.711
Are you the woman
who abandoned my daughter?

855
01:02:01.137 --> 01:02:06.362
