00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.200

<i>Now, you're the only one who can call me out of here.</i>

9
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.840
<i>Son Oh Gong, the Great Sage, the equal of heaven, protect me until the end.</i>

10
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.900
<i>If we take the Guemggango's power out of the equation, what are we to each other?</i>

11
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.840
? <i>Even though it's painful, I'm not going to hurt</i> ?

<i>[Episode 10]</i>

13
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.180
I heard the ringing of the bell.

14
00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.730
So I misunderstood.

15
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.030
That maybe we're specially destined to each other

16
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.180
like soulmates.

17
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.460
So that's why you're dreaming ridiculous things like this?

18
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.480
Yeah. But now I know.

19
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.390
That something like this

20
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.250
will never happen.

21
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.710
? <i>Anyway, it's already been decided</i> ?

22
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:28.410
? <i>Even though I knew this would be farewell, why am I like this</i> ?

23
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.750
Are you regaining consciousness?

24
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.530
Can you tell me what happened?

25
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.800
I'll take away the kid with special abilities

26
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.530
who brings you unhappiness.

27
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.890
That bookseller..

28
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.740
told me when I was young that she would take me away.

29
00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.380
Oh, so that's what happened.

30
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:16.420
And so that's how you lost your abilities as Sam Jang.

31
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.370
- What? 
 - You said you asked her to take away what makes you special.

32
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.830
Then...she actually did that for me?

33
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.140
All of your powers as Sam Jang

34
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.460
have now been lost to that bookseller.

35
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:41.960
Jin Seon Mi, you're no longer Sam Jang.

36
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.310
Now you can return to living an ordinary life like you always wanted.

37
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.610
And we have no reason to see one another again.

38
00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.150
Now I am an ordinary person?

39
00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.200
Sam Jang's fate has now been completely turned over to that bookseller.

40
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.470
Then did her contract with Son Oh Gong also get transferred to her?

41
00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.360
Probably. Since the one who made the contract

42
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.310
is the younger Jin Seon Mi who's been handed over to that bookseller.

43
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.940
The kid Jin Seon Mi who made the contract with me is in one of the books in here somewhere.

44
00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.520
So that's how you were able to call me.

45
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:42.590
Now I am the one who's able to call for the Great Sage.

46
00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.480
Since I am the new owner of the Geumganggo.

47
00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.330
Your heart will now start to love me.

48
00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.480
Damn it.

49
00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.400
I can't hold back anymore.

50
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.330
So the owner of the Geumganggo has changed?

51
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:21.380
The power of Sam Jang and the contract was handed over to her.

52
00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.100
So naturally, Geumganggo's love probably transferred over, too, right?

53
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.380
I think so, but there's no way of knowing

54
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.880
whether Geumganggo was activated by Sam Jang's abilities,

55
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.070
or human Jin Seon Mi's.

56
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.310
How could it be activated by a human's abilities? It must have been activated by her abilities as Sam Jang of course.

57
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.520
Then now...

58
00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.910
the one Son Oh Gong loves must not be Jin Sun Mi

59
00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.050
but rather that bookseller.

60
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.480
That's probably something only Oh Gong knows.

61
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.730
Looks like you're not the owner of Geumganggo.

62
00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.630
You should look annoying pretty to me even when you pathetically glare at me,

63
00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.880
but even when you're smiling I can't stand the sight of you.

64
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.300
Who do you think you're glaring at!

65
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.800
You can't hurt me. I have the contract.

66
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.620
Even after getting hit that much, you still don't get it? I'm an extremely bad guy.

67
00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.950
Do you think a bad guy would faithfully stick to a contract? I'm so bad that

68
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.860
that they even put a Geumganggo on me.

69
00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.470
So that's why you came here to look for the book for that girl?

70
00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.610
What to do? Unless that girl wants you to, you'll never be able to find it.

71
00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.890
She was the one who asked for it.

72
00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:44.310
To take away the specialness which makes her unfortunate.

73
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.660
She's finally able to live like a normal human being.

74
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.140
Do you think she'd be happy to go back to how she was?

75
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:52.440
No, she probably wouldn't be happy.

76
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:55.990
Good for her. It's not like I was here to reverse it anyway.

77
00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:59.440
Son Oh Gong, didn't you come here so you could find the book?

78
00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:04.250
Why would I look for that? This is a golden opportunity to break that contract. I should leave it nice and hidden.

79
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.360
If you weren't even looking for the book then why'd you have to hit me!

80
00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.260
Because you put me in a bad mood!

81
00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.330
The owner of the Geumganggo? What ridiculous crap.

82
00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.500
There's only one owner of this Geumganggo.

83
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.490
Hey, I let you live instead of killing you

84
00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.460
so keep hiding these books in here well.

85
00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:35.240
And if you call me for no good reason I'll kill you.

86
00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:45.470
I took both her powers and contract.

87
00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.010
But why is Geumganggo still the same?

88
00:06:55.570 --> 00:07:00.600
Are the books with the trapped children's souls not in here?

89
00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:15.390
Child, how did you get out of your book?

90
00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:22.370
You spoke with the Great Sage but now you've sealed your lips again I see.

91
00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:27.340
At least come with me.

92
00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.730
She's definitely dead.

93
00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:44.320
Why did she suddenly die?

94
00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:58.440
Yes.

95
00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:03.600
I'm in the stairway for the second floor basement at the broadcasting station. Hurry.

96
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:15.560
Where did she go?

97
00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:24.260
<i>She was definitely dead but then the body just disappeared all of a sudden.</i>

98
00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:34.470
That woman...

99
00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:38.140
What exactly is she?

100
00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:43.400
Where is Bu Ja? She's not even answering her phone.

101
00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:48.130
Where are you two going? Take me along.

102
00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:51.300
Why are you being a pest and following other people on their scheduled activities?

103
00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:54.040
There's already a scandal about us so who cares?

104
00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:58.410
There will be news of our breakup soon. We're in our cooling off period, so we can't meet.

105
00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:03.480
I think we can overcome our cooling off period.

106
00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:09.550
Shall we go to the East Sea? I'll show you around the dragon sea palace.

107
00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:12.400
You've been kicked out of your house. Geez.

108
00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:29.430
Bu Ja! Bu Ja! What's wrong with you?

109
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:31.330
What's wrong with her?

110
00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:33.790
The zombie seems strange.

111
00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:39.540
Jeo Pal Gye, Prince.

112
00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:41.640
I'm feeling strange.

113
00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:44.840
I even fed you the energy beads so why are you like this?

114
00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:52.910
Pig, when did the zombie get this rotten? She stinks.

115
00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:08.170
My wife is looking after the kids at our home. Are you okay, CEO?

116
00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:09.260
I'm fine.

117
00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.160
We almost had a really bad accident on our hands.

118
00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:19.300
If you'd rather me not, I won't ask about it but

119
00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:26.450
how did you know that there would be a fire there and saved those kids?

120
00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.050
It's a little frightening

121
00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:34.500
but I feel like you're a very special person.

122
00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.770
I-In any case, you did something really great.

123
00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:43.900
Things like that won't happen anymore.

124
00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:49.270
And what about Secretary Son? It's his job to protect you, so where was he at that moment?

125
00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:51.330
I know, right?

126
00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:55.510
He used to come without me even calling him, but now he's not coming.

127
00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:08.330
<i> You are no longer Sam Jang. </i>

128
00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.500
Is it really true?

129
00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:16.480
<i>If you're not Sam Jang, there is no reason to call me, the Great Sage.</i>

130
00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:21.400
<i>If your special ability disappears, then I disappear as well.</i>

131
00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.350
<i>Is that really okay?</i>

132
00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:27.250
<i>Do you still want that?</i>

133
00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.490
Son Oh Gong.

134
00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:47.890
Son Oh Gong.

135
00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.780
Son Oh Gong.

136
00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:12.430
He's really not coming.

137
00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:27.690
Ah, what a beauty.

138
00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:36.580
I came to see the one who gained Sam Jang's power.

139
00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:39.340
Secretary Ma.

140
00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:49.710
<i>[Contract]</i>

141
00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:55.110
Please sign a contract with Lucifer Entertainment.

142
00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:05.360
Are you here to see Hyungnim?

143
00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:07.540
Because he didn't come when I called him.

144
00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:11.400
Is he here?

145
00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.490
He is inside.

146
00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.980
Please come inside.

147
00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:30.010
Son Oh Gong.

148
00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:33.360
Hey, Jin Seon Mi. You've changed.

149
00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.460
You knew?

150
00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:37.360
As you wanted, you've become an ordinary human being.

151
00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.020
Congratulations.

152
00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:45.440
But why are you here? There shouldn't be any reason for you to see me now.

153
00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:05.580
You really won't come when I call you now?

154
00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:08.190
Yes. I heard you transferred over the contract.

155
00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:11.570
Then you won't be protecting me anymore?

156
00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:13.480
There's no need to protect you.

157
00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:17.290
You are no longer Sam Jang, so there won't be any evil spirits after you anymore.

158
00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:20.630
So there's no reason for you to call me, and I won't be coming even if you call me.

159
00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:23.670
Just live ordinarily and comfortably.

160
00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:29.910
What about the Geumganggo?

161
00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:38.150
You're still wearing the Geumganggo.

162
00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:52.430
You don't love me anymore?

163
00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:02.270
I guess so. You don't look especially pretty anymore.

164
00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:12.920
Then that's a relief.

165
00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:17.010
Now there's no need for me to see you anymore.

166
00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:41.950
What? The owner of the Geumganggo didn't change?

167
00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:46.240
Even though Sam Jang's ability and contract with Son Oh Gong transferred over to me,

168
00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:48.730
the power of the Geumganggo didn't transfer over to me.

169
00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:54.250
T-then Son Oh Gong is still

170
00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:58.520
Jin Seon Mi's love slave.

171
00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:05.550
Gosh, seriously...

172
00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:27.920
Hyungnim, Jin Seon Mi left.

173
00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:37.280
Okay. Ah, I held it in well.

174
00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:40.730
At the last moment, I almost couldn't hold it in and nearly clung to her to ask her not to leave.

175
00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:43.620
You held it in very well.

176
00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:50.450
If you take advantage of this opportunity, you'll be able to free yourself from the contract.

177
00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:55.770
Yes. I just need to suppress this wretched love.

178
00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:04.120
Even though you could hide if from Jin Seon Mi,

179
00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:07.070
what are you going to do about Ma Wang?

180
00:17:07.070 --> 00:17:10.090
He's probably going to make it impossible me to go by hounding after me about racking up points for him.

181
00:17:10.090 --> 00:17:13.540
It'll be hard to make him give up.

182
00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:15.840
I'll have to approach him sincerely.

183
00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:22.970
Jin Seon Mi didn't ask you anything or bother you, right?

184
00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:26.850
Not at all. She just turned around and left.

185
00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:28.640
Right.

186
00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:34.580
Seems like she didn't love me at all.

187
00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:38.300
And Jin Seon Mi—

188
00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:41.660
Don't talk about her anymore. If it hurts any more, I won't be able to hold back.

189
00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:48.160
I won't say anything.

190
00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:09.690
I will... never say it.

191
00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:34.480
You said there wouldn't be any reason for us to see each other anymore. What brought you back here?

192
00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.960
You signed a contract with our company.

193
00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:40.550
We can't end it just like that.

194
00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:44.830
Have you met with Son Oh Gong?

195
00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:49.600
Yes. As you said, I'm no longer Sam Jang.

196
00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:53.270
Even if I call him now, he says he won't come.

197
00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:57.120
He said that himself?

198
00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.050
What did he say about the Geumganggo?

199
00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:03.330
I guess that's also useless now. It didn't hold any power.

200
00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:05.530
Oh, is that so?

201
00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:09.710
I'm no longer Sam Jang nor the owner of the Geumganggo.

202
00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:13.960
So I don't think there will be any other way for me to uphold the contract with you.

203
00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:21.190
You're responsible for breaking the contract

204
00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:23.390
so I have to get at least something from you.

205
00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:25.500
Do I have to pay a penalty fee for breach of contract?

206
00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:28.600
Well, if you want to. Or...

207
00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:34.940
your life could be another way.

208
00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:43.410
I'll have to think about how to resolve the remainder of the contract with you who's now a human.

209
00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:48.130
What will happen to Son Oh Gong now?

210
00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:50.870
Son Oh Gong is still wearing the Geumganggo.

211
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:53.430
So he's probably in love with someone.

212
00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:55.850
That bookseller...

213
00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:59.270
is the new owner of the Geumganggo?

214
00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:04.390
Since he told you he doesn't love you anymore, then probably...

215
00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:08.600
he'll end up...

216
00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:16.290
loving that bookseller, I suppose?

217
00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:27.860
Why didn't you tell her that he doesn't love the bookseller?

218
00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:30.740
Because I dislike her. I really dislike her.

219
00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:33.800
Why did she have to make things into such a bother like this?

220
00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:36.560
If you dislike her a lot, then should I kill her?

221
00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:40.300
Forget it. As she wished, she's an ordinary human being now.

222
00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:42.540
I just hope that she lives well.

223
00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:46.080
Then who exactly is the owner of the Geumganggo now?

224
00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:49.690
Since only Son Oh Gong knows that,

225
00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:53.690
we'll have to watch him carefully.

226
00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:02.800
So you were here.

227
00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.590
Ma Wang, why did you come to Sureumdong?

228
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:08.900
You weren't at home.

229
00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:11.560
It's a suitcase. Where are you going?

230
00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:15.630
Yeah. I brought it out for the first time in a long while but it's pretty small.

231
00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:19.860
I was going to put in my statue, the car 5050,

232
00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:23.340
and even my bath and leave but it's too small.

233
00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:25.700
Where are you going with all that?

234
00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:27.700
Are you going far away?

235
00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:32.800
It's too cold. I want to go somewhere warm.

236
00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:35.830
What about Sam Jang?

237
00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:39.740
She's no longer Sam Jang. You know that too.

238
00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:42.270
She won't be calling me anymore.

239
00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:50.940
I know. But you're still wearing the Geumganggo.

240
00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:55.740
Jin Seon Mi, who has become ordinary, will live well.

241
00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:58.960
She'll fall in love and get married.

242
00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:02.400
Can you really just watch that happen?

243
00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:07.480
Of course I can't just watch that happen. Because I lover her.

244
00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:13.990
Right? You still love her, don't you?

245
00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:20.190
Is that why you're packing up here in this sad state?

246
00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:23.010
Great Sage, you don't have to be like this.

247
00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:25.170
Just change her back to Sam Jang again.

248
00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:29.040
Since the Jin Seon Mi who is Sam Jang needs you, she absolutely cannot live without you.

249
00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:32.280
If she lives without you, she'll die.

250
00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:34.580
That's right.

251
00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:39.450
If I wanted to, I could make her stay by my side.

252
00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:42.560
Every day when I miss her, I could go see her.

253
00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:46.820
Ma Wang, I've become really weird.

254
00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:47.820
Why?

255
00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:53.430
I just want her to live an ordinary life as she wanted.

256
00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:59.680
Even though it hurts my heart.

257
00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:06.640
Does that make sense?

258
00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:11.340
Whenever I think about how I can't see her,

259
00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:15.250
my tears are brimming and my heart is being ripped apart.

260
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:18.400
But so that she'll be happy,

261
00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.960
I'm here packing up like this.

262
00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:24.140
Does this make any sense?

263
00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:30.150
I guess this is what it is to be annoyingly in love with someone.

264
00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:36.800
Son Oh Gong, you're really in love.

265
00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:46.960
Should I lend you my suitcase?

266
00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:49.360
A bus can fit in mine.

267
00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.350
Really?

268
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:54.620
Even a house should be able to fit in your suitcase. Shall I pack my house, too?

269
00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:58.290
Hey, why is that your house? I have half ownership of that house.

270
00:23:58.290 --> 00:24:03.710
Leave it behind and just come take a bath there from time to time.

271
00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:07.250
Instead of that, do you want to just take this opportunity and go somewhere warm with me?

272
00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:09.140
You've already said "you pass" enough times.

273
00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:12.520
Forget it. Just go.

274
00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:15.640
Seriously.

275
00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:22.140
To commemorate you coming to Sureumdong, I'll give you a bottle of wine as a gift. Take your pick.

276
00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:24.600
Really? Why are you like this?

277
00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:26.960
But you can only pick from here to there.

278
00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:30.960
So sly. You really are a thug.

279
00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:32.810
Then, I'll pick this—

280
00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:34.670
No, I said to pick from the front.

281
00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:37.040
Making me say it twice.

282
00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:38.560
Then you pick one.

283
00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:43.060
Then... this one is good.

284
00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:44.350
You gave me a cheap one.

285
00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:45.820
Still, I gave you a good one.

286
00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:48.470
Thank you, thug.

287
00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:49.480
Seriously.

288
00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:55.300
Because General Frost isn't sleeping and just sitting, the night is so cold.

289
00:24:55.300 --> 00:25:00.230
Because I keep thinking about the poor kids, I can't sleep.

290
00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:06.770
Because the bookseller captured Sam Jang within the books, we can't destroy the bookstore.

291
00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:10.910
Because of that, we also cannot save the poor children captured in the books.

292
00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:12.180
This is going to be a headache.

293
00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:17.070
I could only bring this lost girl who escaped from the books.

294
00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:25.680
The child will not tell me how she escaped the book.

295
00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:34.880
The bookseller that captured the children in books..

296
00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:39.210
The humans that abused their kids are even worse than that.

297
00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:45.270
The evilness in a human is what made this evil spirit.

298
00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:49.980
By the way, what happened to Jin Seon Mi and Son Oh Gong?

299
00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:54.910
Jin Seon Mi doesn't want to be Sam Jang, Oh Gong doesn't want to be a guardian.

300
00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:56.730
Just tell everyone to forget it.

301
00:25:56.730 --> 00:26:00.940
Just let them break up and go their own way.

302
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:18.070
<i>This is a love bell.<i></i></i>

303
00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:23.100
<i>It tells you who your chosen fate is.<i></i></i>

304
00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:28.570
? <i>When I saw you</i> ?

305
00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:31.120
? <i>I think only about you</i> ?

306
00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:33.930
? <i>When I love you</i> ?

307
00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:39.810
? <i>Did you miss me</i> ?

308
00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:44.620
? <i>Even if my feelings change</i> ?

309
00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:50.680
<i>If you weren't in my life, I wouldn't have been Sam Jang.<i></i></i>

310
00:26:52.090 --> 00:26:54.500
I should pack. I should pack.

311
00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:58.070
? <i>Can we go back</i> ?

312
00:26:58.070 --> 00:27:00.130
? <i>When I saw you</i> ?

313
00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:05.020
<i> Even if your feelings are fake, I'm thankful and glad that you love me.</i>

314
00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:06.870
<i>It's the truth.</i>

315
00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:12.710
? <i>Always behind of you</i> ?

316
00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:18.190
Alright. From now on, I'm just ordinary Jin Seon Mi.

317
00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:23.500
? <i>Always behind of you</i> ?

318
00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:47.490
This doesn't work either.

319
00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:51.840
Jeol Pal Gye.

320
00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:56.710
I think I just keep rotting.

321
00:27:58.330 --> 00:28:02.230
Now as I'm rotting, I'm going to disappear.

322
00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:08.480
You won't disappear. You're now my brother.

323
00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:13.260
You won't disappear easily. I'll find another solution.

324
00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:34.990
Jeol Pal Gye, what were you doing in there?

325
00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:37.820
You cannot go in there.

326
00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:41.750
Bu Ja is being weird. Where is Ma Wang?

327
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:43.840
Even if Ma Wang was here, it would be no use.

328
00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:45.170
Why?

329
00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:47.280
The power of Sam Jang was sealed.

330
00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:52.670
The possessed corpse that woke up with Sam Jang's blood will soon return to an ordinary corpse.

331
00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:56.540
That zombie, as she keeps rotting, is she going to disappear?

332
00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:59.300
As time passes, she might become an evil spirit.

333
00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:03.800
Before that, we need to burn her.

334
00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:09.290
Hand over some energy beads before I turn this whole agency over, you bitch!

335
00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:11.630
Give up, pig!

336
00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:15.670
If Sam Jang's powers are gone, we can't do anything about the zombie rotting.

337
00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:21.250
Just leave her. Ma Wang will burn her.

338
00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:25.360
Bu Ja is my brother.

339
00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:28.700
If she disappears, I want to be the one to rid of her.

340
00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:30.840
Let me take her.

341
00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:37.600
Before she becomes a problem, hurry and get rid of her.

342
00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:40.670
I won't report to Ma Wang.

343
00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:51.150
Are you okay, pig?

344
00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:55.530
This is all..

345
00:29:57.610 --> 00:30:00.320
Sam Jang's fault.

346
00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:14.360
Whoever lives in this building can't live here for more than 3 months without a panic attack.

347
00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:17.460
They moved out because of the panic attacks and nightmares.

348
00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:30.990
Yes. I want to go inside today to confirm something.

349
00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:32.350
What?

350
00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:36.520
How ordinary I am. Let's go.

351
00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:44.970
How is going to a place like this ordinary?

352
00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:48.990
Should I just quit? I can't take this stress.

353
00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:14.440
I really don't see anything.

354
00:31:25.910 --> 00:31:29.620
CEO, there's nothing, but it feels creepy.

355
00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:35.120
You're right. Because we can't see anything it's just creepy.

356
00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:44.910
Ah, wind. Wind! Didn't you just feel a breeze?

357
00:31:50.290 --> 00:31:54.470
I've really become ordinary. I don't see anything.

358
00:31:54.470 --> 00:32:00.360
But CEO, do you really plan on buying this building?

359
00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:05.940
Lee Han Joo, from now on, please don't look into houses that are haunted by ghosts.

360
00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:11.090
Let's try turning over a new leaf and making our Hanbit Real Estate an agency for normal properties now.

361
00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:14.420
I think we can do that now.

362
00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:17.170
This is really good news.

363
00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:41.720
I've already wrapped up and packed the 5050 car and your statue.

364
00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:45.570
I've also packed a fridge with the side dishes that you like to eat and kimchi.

365
00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:49.390
When you move, remember to plug it in.

366
00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:53.370
See if I missed anything.

367
00:32:53.370 --> 00:32:56.140
I'm sure you probably took care of everything just fine.

368
00:32:57.510 --> 00:33:01.420
I see Ma Wang let you go quite easily.

369
00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:04.180
I thought he was going to pester you over the contract.

370
00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:06.670
Ma Wang's weakness is love.

371
00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:11.000
I said I was leaving for Jin Seon Mi's happiness, so he believed me.

372
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:16.140
Ma Wang is someone that's endured through 1,000 years already on love alone.

373
00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:20.320
So I suppose he could understand how love can make people do things.

374
00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:25.430
That's why I'm saying his way of thinking that just because he's that way everyone else must be that way is dangerous.

375
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:32.950
Hyungnim, I believe that thinking that you're definitely different from other people is also dangerous though.

376
00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:39.380
So that you don't have any regrets after you leave to go far away,

377
00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:43.370
you should check one more time for anything you might have forgotten

378
00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:46.360
in case it eats at you later.

379
00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:48.460
Anything I've forgotten?

380
00:33:53.890 --> 00:33:56.580
Son Oh Gong is already packing.

381
00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:59.220
He's going far away.

382
00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:01.600
Where?

383
00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:03.760
A warm country.

384
00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:09.680
If he stays there for a good 50-60 years and comes back then you should be dead by then.

385
00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:12.510
You won't see each other again.

386
00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:16.060
He's going to be gone for that long?

387
00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:19.560
50-60 years to us is like the blink of an eye.

388
00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:22.550
That's an extremely long blink.

389
00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:38.130
- What is it? 
 - About Geumganggo,

390
00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:41.030
what's the activation method for it?

391
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:44.660
The activation method? Why?

392
00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:49.780
Giving up on it like this is too much of a waste of Geumganggo.

393
00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:54.690
I thought it might be still be effective if it was re-activated.

394
00:34:54.690 --> 00:34:59.650
If it's reactivated will Son Oh Gong love that woman?

395
00:34:59.650 --> 00:35:01.300
That's right.

396
00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:05.540
Once it's successfully activated, he'll have to love her in the exact same way.

397
00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:07.620
No doubt about it.

398
00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:10.530
How can it be the same?

399
00:35:10.530 --> 00:35:14.990
Even just this past Monday afternoon he was saying he loved me enough to destroy a whole world for me.

400
00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:20.430
Well, on Monday afternoon he had been under activation but now he's not.

401
00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:24.200
I paid an awfully large price for that Geumganggo.

402
00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:28.020
How many days has it been already? Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday...

403
00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:29.550
You can't extend it any longer.

404
00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:30.990
But the bookseller is an evil spirit.

405
00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:34.760
As long as I can use Son Oh Gong to rack up points,

406
00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:38.180
I don't care if bait gets caught in the middle.

407
00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:40.460
I care.

408
00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:44.010
If you're that curious then go and ask that guy.

409
00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:45.940
I'm leaving.

410
00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:55.140
Shall I capture her and torture it out of her?

411
00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:56.510
Leave it.

412
00:35:56.510 --> 00:36:01.430
She's still a human that Son Oh Gong loves. It's best to be cautious with her.

413
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:06.290
If he loves her so much, is it possible for Geumganggo's owner to change?

414
00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:12.490
If only I knew the activation method I wanted to test that out.

415
00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:15.530
But she's not telling me it.

416
00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:18.580
She's very close to the Summer Fairy.

417
00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:20.950
I'll try looking into it from that approach.

418
00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:21.500
<i>[Hanbit Real Estate]</i>

419
00:36:30.130 --> 00:36:36.210
<i>Once it's successfully activated again he'll have to love her in the exact same way. No doubt about it.</i>

420
00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:52.140
Son Oh Gong.

421
00:36:57.090 --> 00:36:59.490
Did you come because I called you?

422
00:36:59.490 --> 00:37:03.840
I didn't come because you called me. I can't hear you call anymore.

423
00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:09.200
Then why did you come?

424
00:37:10.850 --> 00:37:14.700
I'm came because I'm going far away, but I forgot something.

425
00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:16.180
What?

426
00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:19.470
-A farewell.
-A farewell?

427
00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:24.420
I felt like if I just left I would regret it and it would probably eat at me.

428
00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:30.530
I thought since we've spent time together I should at least wish you well first.

429
00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:32.310
You're going far away?

430
00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:33.840
Yeah.

431
00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:37.800
Why? You want to hold on to me? Cling and beg?

432
00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:39.870
Are you hounding after me?

433
00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:42.930
-I'm not going to do that.

434
00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:49.450
-Of course, little Jin Seon Mi..

435
00:37:49.450 --> 00:37:52.630
she would tell me not to go and beg..

436
00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:55.350
Old Jin Seon Mi wouldn't do that.

437
00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:58.260
You grew up well.

438
00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:02.600
If you are going to say a farewell, say it at the bookstore.

439
00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:05.790
That Jin Seon Mi isn't here.

440
00:38:08.210 --> 00:38:11.040
I see, I forgot.

441
00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:14.380
The person in front of me is the normal Jin Seon Mi, isn't she?

442
00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:18.570
Son Oh Gong, not me

443
00:38:18.570 --> 00:38:22.020
there's a new owner of the Geumganggo?

444
00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:27.010
Then you would do the same thing as you did for me, right?

445
00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:29.630
Are you asking if I'll love her?

446
00:38:30.430 --> 00:38:34.320
Why, you wouldn't me to do that? Are you going to beg?

447
00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:37.820
Forget it.

448
00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:42.670
Normal office workers are busy right now and so they're tired.

449
00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:48.410
I want to rest, so leave now.

450
00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:52.540
You're understandably tired. Why are you going around with that thing stuck to your side?

451
00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:54.410
What?

452
00:38:54.410 --> 00:39:00.150
What? So now that you've become normal you can't see spirits anymore, huh? No wonder.

453
00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:04.610
If you have that thing attached to you, you'll keep being tired.

454
00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:08.190
Why, are you looking at me? Do want my help?

455
00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:10.220
You want to hound after me?

456
00:39:11.590 --> 00:39:13.670
Forget it.

457
00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:17.750
Just turn a blind eye and leave things that normal people can't see alone.

458
00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:20.880
I want to ignore it as well. Please go.

459
00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:26.400
Alright. Live well.

460
00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:49.020
Time to withdraw.

461
00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:51.060
- Gorgeous? 
 - Gorgeous. It's a word we can use.

462
00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:53.060
Waterpark

463
00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:55.560
- Waterpark? 
- Yeah

464
00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:58.560
Secretary Son! I thought you quit?

465
00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:00.830
Ah you came to say bye?

466
00:40:02.590 --> 00:40:08.010
You know, we've never been properly introduced. Jonathan Lee.

467
00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:22.180
We haven't been close,

468
00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:25.730
but it's still pretty regretful. Go safely.

469
00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:29.210
Can you move for a moment?

470
00:40:29.210 --> 00:40:32.030
Jonathan, the pizza will get cold. Quickly, quickly.

471
00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:34.900
Sorry.

472
00:40:55.530 --> 00:40:57.890
Spicy rice cake, very good!

473
00:40:57.890 --> 00:41:00.080
Hyungnim, I know tteobokki, okay?

474
00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:05.890
Is the fan heater broken? There's a chill in here.

475
00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:10.460
Seon Mi, there's a fun musical playing.

476
00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:12.550
Do you want to come see it with me today?

477
00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:16.030
- Are you okay? 
 - I'm fine.

478
00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:17.760
Oh, that's hot!

479
00:41:19.070 --> 00:41:23.170
CEO, go see the musical.

480
00:41:23.170 --> 00:41:27.120
Woah! Wow, seriously what's with things today?

481
00:41:31.170 --> 00:41:35.560
Then shall we go see the musical today?

482
00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:40.500
What's going on? Sheesh.

483
00:41:45.210 --> 00:41:48.500
Good job. Now, beat it.

484
00:41:53.410 --> 00:41:55.420
? <i>When I saw you</i> ?

485
00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:57.200
Please wait a bit.

486
00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:07.700
? <i>Always behind of you</i> ?

487
00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:11.010
Looking for me?

488
00:42:14.830 --> 00:42:18.890
? <i>Always behind of you</i> ?

489
00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:24.350
You have something to say now? Say it.

490
00:42:24.350 --> 00:42:29.560
- A farewell. I felt like I never properly said it to you. 
 - A farewell?

491
00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:31.560
Thank you for everything all this time.

492
00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:35.110
Go somewhere warm and live well.

493
00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:36.780
Good-bye.

494
00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:39.530
Hey, Jin Seon Mi.

495
00:42:45.570 --> 00:42:51.520
After all the things done I've for you, all you have to say about it is "thank you"?

496
00:42:54.330 --> 00:42:58.840
After all the pain you put my heart through, now you tell me "live well"?

497
00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:01.720
And now you're telling me "good-bye" without even trying to hold on to me once!

498
00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:03.120
You've suffered because of Geumganggo.

499
00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:05.670
Even though I'm going to stop piling my love onto you, you're really fine with that?

500
00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:07.840
It was fake, wasn't it?

501
00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:11.680
You should be happy now too because the contract with me is gone.

502
00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:13.400
Speak for yourself.

503
00:43:14.330 --> 00:43:17.520
You must be happy as a lark now that you can live like a normal person instead of Sam Jang.

504
00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:22.990
That's right. I am. Because of a certain someone I had to live a tortured life being someone special.

505
00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:25.450
I like being normal now.

506
00:43:25.450 --> 00:43:30.010
Congrats on becoming an unremarkable person that will never need to call the likes of someone great like me.

507
00:43:30.010 --> 00:43:35.000
Live a happy life eating Ddeokbokki with all those other boring people just like you.

508
00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:04.340
That's a preservative that will slow down a corpse's rotting process.

509
00:44:05.410 --> 00:44:09.440
There's really no medicine for saving a possessed corpse that's rotting?

510
00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:12.610
- Look for it with your all. 
 - There isn't any.

511
00:44:13.850 --> 00:44:17.330
Once you start rotting, there aren't a lot of solutions.

512
00:44:17.330 --> 00:44:20.770
Would eating a live person work?

513
00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:28.040
That's a really fast pig.

514
00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:32.230
Here, eat this.

515
00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:41.450
They said that if I keep rotting, I'll become an evil spirit.

516
00:44:41.450 --> 00:44:43.180
I..

517
00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:46.480
Just burn me.

518
00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:50.030
I found a solution, you'll be okay.

519
00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:51.820
I smell a lot.

520
00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:56.740
It's okay. Ah, this is a secret..

521
00:44:56.740 --> 00:45:00.960
I got hit on the nose so much by the monkey, I can't smell well.

522
00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:03.060
Is that so?

523
00:45:08.970 --> 00:45:13.510
Have two more preservative pills. Here.

524
00:45:25.490 --> 00:45:29.150
<i>Once a possessed corpse starts rotting, even with eating preservatives she won't last more than a few days.</i>

525
00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:32.530
<i>If she eats a living person it might work though.</i>

526
00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:35.800
This is all Sam Jang's fault..

527
00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:38.580
Sam Jang must take responsibility.

528
00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:51.210
The weather is so nice today.

529
00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:54.680
Instead of watching a musical, shall we take a walk?

530
00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:56.580
Shall we?

531
00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:06.480
That child..

532
00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.880
Someone you know?

533
00:46:14.410 --> 00:46:16.540
Soo Jeong

534
00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:24.780
That bookseller isn't going to appear again, is she?

535
00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:29.760
If you have something to do, you can go.

536
00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:34.830
No, there is nothing I can do now.

537
00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:39.950
You don't have your umbrella today.

538
00:46:39.950 --> 00:46:41.460
I don't need it anymore.

539
00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:45.910
When you were younger, you always carried your umbrella.

540
00:46:45.910 --> 00:46:48.600
Even when it wasn't raining.

541
00:46:49.050 --> 00:46:53.980
My umbrella, it wasn't for the rain.

542
00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:59.930
I, too, was protected with that umbrella once before.

543
00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:08.610
Hey, you're-

544
00:47:08.610 --> 00:47:11.060
I couldn't see it with my own eyes.

545
00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:14.090
But you were steadfastly fending off something very scary.

546
00:47:14.090 --> 00:47:17.370
I knew that you helped me.

547
00:47:17.370 --> 00:47:19.560
You're my hero.

548
00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:21.850
You were really cool.

549
00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:25.730
Is that so?

550
00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:38.850
For some reason, I get the feeling that for that child as well a rain that I can't see

551
00:47:38.850 --> 00:47:41.360
is falling on him.

552
00:47:50.570 --> 00:47:54.510
Noona, you can see my little sister, right?

553
00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:58.390
I have something to tell her.

554
00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:00.910
Noona, please help me.

555
00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:06.040
Sorry, I don't have that ability anymore.

556
00:48:10.590 --> 00:48:14.200
Because of her, you haven't been able to sleep and just stayed put?

557
00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:21.890
Yes, just in case the child felt uncomfortable, I have been watching over her.

558
00:48:21.890 --> 00:48:24.470
But she hasn't talked yet.

559
00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:27.730
Really? She talked before.

560
00:48:27.730 --> 00:48:31.630
I have to take care of the ice cream shop.

561
00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:35.720
Great Sage,  just play with her for a moment, and try to make her talk.

562
00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:40.440
? I don't want to, why would I, how much would you give me? ?

563
00:48:47.290 --> 00:48:52.000
? Even if you give me ?500, I wouldn't play with you. ?

564
00:48:55.530 --> 00:48:58.360
You already got a response.

565
00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:02.000
Wow. You are on the same level as the kid.

566
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:06.870
I have to look after the ice cream shop, so watch the kid.

567
00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:10.800
I have to pack- hey General Frost I'm busy!

568
00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:18.310
Hey, do you think since you're a ghost that I would have sympathy?

569
00:49:18.310 --> 00:49:22.270
I'm just going to watch you. Don't ask for anything.

570
00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:28.720
Since I let you know to activate the Geumganggo, try it.

571
00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:29.950
I should.

572
00:49:29.950 --> 00:49:33.480
Now, sign the contract with my company.

573
00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:40.010
Before that, we have to clean up your bad deeds.

574
00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:43.770
Let's release all the kids from the books.

575
00:49:43.770 --> 00:49:47.320
And swear that you'll never do that again.

576
00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:49.750
Son Oh Gong, who had made more sins than you,

577
00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:53.480
had repent, and works for me to rack points up.

578
00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:55.590
He reborned

579
00:49:55.590 --> 00:49:59.370
you can also do it, believe me.

580
00:49:59.370 --> 00:50:02.590
I don't have any thoughts to release the children.

581
00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:10.950
-What? 
-These miserable children had suffered so much.

582
00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:16.790
Having those children living in happy fairytales, what's so bad about that?

583
00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:20.140
If you capture souls in books,

584
00:50:20.140 --> 00:50:23.620
they can't be reborn.

585
00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:27.470
Why would you want them to live in this hellish world again?

586
00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:31.660
There are happy here.

587
00:50:39.550 --> 00:50:41.470
The bookseller can't be the one.

588
00:50:47.370 --> 00:50:50.700
I looked like she was doing it for the children's sakes though.

589
00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:52.430
Don't make me laugh.

590
00:51:01.170 --> 00:51:04.140
It'd be great if we could turn her back into Sam Jang.

591
00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:06.410
How can we do that?

592
00:51:06.410 --> 00:51:07.930
Indeed.

593
00:51:07.930 --> 00:51:13.570
If Jin Seon Mi's powers as Sam Jang are were restored then Bu Ja would be able to live again as well.

594
00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:17.460
Bu Ja? What's wrong with her?

595
00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:20.210
Ah, I didn't report it to you.

596
00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:24.520
Ever since the moment Sam Jang lost her abilities, the possessed corpse has developed a problem.

597
00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:28.290
Don't worry. I had Jeo Pal Gye take care of it.

598
00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:32.550
- Pal Gye will? 
 - Yes, sir.

599
00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:37.480
Then she should be in danger...

600
00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:41.090
- And this one is for Choi Yoo Jin. 
 - Choi Yoo Jin?

601
00:51:41.090 --> 00:51:43.570
Add a heart too, please.

602
00:51:45.410 --> 00:51:47.300
Oh, CEO! You're here!

603
00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:50.870
PK and I are both following each other's SNS accounts now!

604
00:51:53.490 --> 00:51:59.300
CEO, I even farted with him (a way of saying you've gotten very close and comfortable with each other).

605
00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:01.010
Is that so?

606
00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:06.890
What brings you here?

607
00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:13.790
I'm here to pick you up. Bu Ja said she missed you.

608
00:52:13.790 --> 00:52:16.500
Ah, you came together with Bu Ja?

609
00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:18.550
Where is she?

610
00:52:38.980 --> 00:52:40.280
This is where Bu Ja is?

611
00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:43.240
She's waiting inside that van.

612
00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:48.060
I'll go get some drinks from the vending machine so go inside first.

613
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:50.570
Okay.

614
00:53:25.260 --> 00:53:26.510
Ma Wang is coming!

615
00:53:26.510 --> 00:53:28.020
Ma Wang?

616
00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:30.150
There's no time. Quickly get in!

617
00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:59.070
What do you think you're doing right now?

618
00:53:59.070 --> 00:54:01.930
Don't interfere. She's not Sam Jang anymore anyway!

619
00:54:01.930 --> 00:54:04.610
There's no reason for you to protect her anymore!

620
00:54:04.610 --> 00:54:07.580
- Move! 
 - Bu Ja needs to eat a person to live!

621
00:54:07.580 --> 00:54:10.630
You stupid pig. That will just turn her into an evil spirit!

622
00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:12.590
Out of the way!

623
00:54:15.860 --> 00:54:19.120
You damned troublemaker

624
00:54:40.050 --> 00:54:42.000
Bu Ja

625
00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:46.890
Are you all right?

626
00:54:49.490 --> 00:54:54.100
Unnie, I'm sorry.

627
00:55:13.330 --> 00:55:15.290
Is there no solution for Bu Ja?

628
00:55:15.290 --> 00:55:19.310
Sam Jang's blood that had been providing her with the power to live is gone

629
00:55:19.310 --> 00:55:21.150
so there's no other solution.

630
00:55:21.150 --> 00:55:27.310
Because that bookseller sealed away your powers as Sam Jang in a book.

631
00:55:27.310 --> 00:55:29.090
When is she going to let the children free?

632
00:55:29.090 --> 00:55:34.170
The bookseller said she has no plans for releasing the children.

633
00:55:34.170 --> 00:55:36.160
Then we need to get rid of the evil spirit!

634
00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:37.900
I have no intention of doing that.

635
00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:41.730
Son Oh Gong will protect that bookseller because of the contract.

636
00:55:41.730 --> 00:55:46.190
And I have a contract with the bookseller because I need to rack up points.

637
00:55:46.190 --> 00:55:50.200
Son Oh Gong is going to protect an evil spirit?

638
00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:55.140
I figured out the activation method for Geumganggo quite well without your help.

639
00:55:55.140 --> 00:55:58.760
I've got a new team to run now.

640
00:56:00.020 --> 00:56:02.690
Someone that's trying to become a deity shouldn't be like this!

641
00:56:02.690 --> 00:56:05.510
How dare you try to preach at me?

642
00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:12.830
That doesn't concern you. Don't get yourself eaten from unnecessarily poking around someone's else's business.

643
00:56:16.870 --> 00:56:19.240
You even know Triceratops?

644
00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:23.460
You're smarter than that real estate guy's daughter.

645
00:56:26.460 --> 00:56:30.020
You were locked up in that library, weren't you?

646
00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:33.150
How did you get out?

647
00:56:33.150 --> 00:56:36.680
If I tell you, what are you going to do?

648
00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:43.400
Tell me what you want.

649
00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:49.550
Please protect my brother.

650
00:56:56.890 --> 00:57:00.160
<i> Please protect me. <i></i></i>

651
00:57:01.660 --> 00:57:06.850
A kid long time ago had a similar favor like yours.

652
00:57:09.010 --> 00:57:12.130
But I abandoned her and ran away because it was an annoyance.

653
00:57:13.220 --> 00:57:16.100
I'm a bad guy like that.

654
00:57:18.660 --> 00:57:20.960
I regret it.

655
00:57:26.670 --> 00:57:30.450
Shall I try properly protecting this time?

656
00:57:34.290 --> 00:57:37.280
Is Jin Seon Mi going to go find the library?

657
00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:45.650
She has to. The only way for her to find her book is if she goes to look for it herself.

658
00:57:47.780 --> 00:57:50.630
I'm not forcing them to stay in there.

659
00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:56.670
There's only one way they can come out, but it's simple.

660
00:57:56.670 --> 00:58:03.880
If they themselves want to come out, they can come out anytime.

661
00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:35.160
Looks like I have a guest.

662
00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:45.640
I'm here to find myself.

663
00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:47.920
Then go ahead and look.

664
00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:18.760
Jin Seon Mi!

665
00:59:26.690 --> 00:59:30.330
- What are you doing? 
 - I came here to look for my book.

666
00:59:35.780 --> 00:59:38.340
You came to help me, huh?

667
00:59:39.290 --> 00:59:42.040
- Yeah. 
 - Thank you.

668
00:59:42.890 --> 00:59:49.260
- I thought you wouldn't ever come to me again and was so sad. 
 - You were?

669
00:59:49.260 --> 00:59:55.740
I'm glad you're here. You're mine now.

670
01:00:03.090 --> 01:00:07.010
You think I'd fall for the same trick again?

671
01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:11.400
You're taking me too lightly.

672
01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:26.490
I thought I had you fooled by my disguise while you were coming in. What a shame.

673
01:00:26.490 --> 01:00:30.370
I was planning on using the activation method that Ma Wang told me.

674
01:00:30.370 --> 01:00:32.490
Ma Wang told you?

675
01:00:32.490 --> 01:00:36.600
That loose-lipped cow. How'd he find that out?

676
01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:40.830
Jin Seon Mi's been going around blurting about kissing me.

677
01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:49.210
You both said you didn't want to find it, but both of you came to find it after all.

678
01:00:52.260 --> 01:00:55.160
Jin Seon Mi is here?

679
01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:57.000
Where is she?

680
01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:07.830
<i>[Peter Pan]</i>

681
01:01:07.830 --> 01:01:12.930
It seems she found her own book but wasn't able to find herself out.

682
01:01:14.670 --> 01:01:18.610
<i>[Peter Pan]</i>

683
01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:23.860
You can't open that book. Only myself and the person it belongs to can open it.

684
01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:26.710
- So you did lock them up. 
 - I keep telling you I didn't.

685
01:01:26.710 --> 01:01:28.660
It's because the kids don't want to come out.

686
01:01:28.660 --> 01:01:34.470
Just like with that disguise you tried on me earlier, you lured those kid's souls here and locked them up.

687
01:01:35.410 --> 01:01:36.710
Open it.

688
01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:39.210
I didn't lure and lock them up!

689
01:01:39.210 --> 01:01:40.980
I love children.

690
01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:42.460
Don't spout that nonsense.

691
01:01:42.460 --> 01:01:46.450
Is collecting pitiful children like they're Pokemon love? Are you some type of evil sprit Otaku?

692
01:01:46.450 --> 01:01:49.110
Do you have any idea of the unfortunate lives these children have lived?

693
01:01:49.110 --> 01:01:51.750
For them, living in this world was hell.

694
01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:54.540
I saved those children!

695
01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:57.540
A kid that escaped and ran away from here asked me to do her a favor.

696
01:01:57.540 --> 01:02:03.890
She asked for me to make certain that her own brother would never be captured here.

697
01:02:03.890 --> 01:02:06.450
Protecting someone so they can live is what saving is.

698
01:02:06.450 --> 01:02:10.100
You're just a monster that takes away people's chance at life.

699
01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:14.390
And that kid was able to get out of that book because she realized you're a monster.

700
01:02:14.390 --> 01:02:17.510
- I am not a monster. 
 - That is exactly your biggest problem.

701
01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:20.050
Which is you not even knowing what you are.

702
01:02:20.050 --> 01:02:25.490
You're an evil spirit that lives off of collecting the unhappiness of children.

703
01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:35.480
No. I-I'm not an evil spirit.

704
01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:41.780
I love these children!

705
01:03:08.390 --> 01:03:10.500
<i>[Peter Pan]</i>

706
01:03:19.620 --> 01:03:21.720
Come back.

707
01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:47.600
Did you really enjoy it here?

708
01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:50.050
Even so, come with me.

709
01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:56.680
It was sad and lonely, but we survived through it well, didn't we?

710
01:03:58.630 --> 01:04:05.190
And although he's very late, that swindling Fairy came to protect us.

711
01:04:05.190 --> 01:04:10.040
So we won't be scared by ourselves anymore.

712
01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:11.830
Let's go.

713
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.270
Son Oh Gong.

714
01:04:44.270 --> 01:04:46.420
I see you've come back.

715
01:04:48.310 --> 01:04:51.340
I came back because I wanted to.

716
01:04:59.190 --> 01:05:02.950
I'm sorry, Jin Seon Mi.

717
01:05:05.550 --> 01:05:07.780
It's okay now.

718
01:05:27.350 --> 01:05:31.690
Why are you over here? It's cold. Did you eat?

719
01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:36.960
It must be cold.

720
01:05:38.210 --> 01:05:42.630
Let's start by getting some food. Let's go.

721
01:05:42.630 --> 01:05:46.800
I wish I could also be taken to where my sister was taken to.

722
01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:49.670
If she hears you say things like that, your little sister will be sad.

723
01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:52.430
Her older brother has to live well.

724
01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:01.650
Ahjussi will help you.

725
01:06:01.650 --> 01:06:06.000
I can't lie to you saying I'll do everything for you like your  Mom or Dad.

726
01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:10.200
But, at the very least, in order to help you live a lively life by yourself

727
01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:13.250
The adults will help you.

728
01:06:18.690 --> 01:06:21.500
Don't cry. It's okay. Don't cry. Don't cry.

729
01:06:26.180 --> 01:06:29.060
It's okay. Don't cry.

730
01:06:32.790 --> 01:06:35.240
It's okay.

731
01:07:08.550 --> 01:07:13.130
Sam Jang has returned!

732
01:07:15.650 --> 01:07:17.940
She's returned!

733
01:07:19.450 --> 01:07:30.790
Ahh, Sam Jang is...Sam Jang is b-b-b-b-b-back!

734
01:07:30.790 --> 01:07:36.970
Sam Jang is b-....back!

735
01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:41.010
I'm going to make sure I've definitely returned as Sam Jang or not.

736
01:07:41.010 --> 01:07:44.120
Shall I try shedding some blood to call evil sprits?

737
01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:47.590
Don't do it. Don't do it. I'm tired!

738
01:07:47.590 --> 01:07:50.490
Dealing with that bookseller was tiring.

739
01:07:50.490 --> 01:07:54.380
Ugh, there were so many books earlier it was dizzying.

740
01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:58.890
I almost got tricked by her disguise and let her activate the Geumganggo.

741
01:07:58.890 --> 01:08:00.880
Activate?

742
01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:07.010
Then it really was possible for the owner of Geumganggo to have changed?

743
01:08:07.820 --> 01:08:12.510
Were you doubtful of that? Were you worried? Did you want to hound after me?

744
01:08:12.510 --> 01:08:16.980
A little. It made me upset.

745
01:08:18.380 --> 01:08:22.280
Of course it did. It's yours after all.

746
01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:26.100
Why'd you have to pretend like you were perfectly fine and put me in a bad mood.

747
01:08:32.050 --> 01:08:36.480
The sole owner of my Geumganggo is you, Jin Seon Mi.

748
01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:44.680
Right. The only one that can call you, Son Oh Gong, is me.

749
01:08:48.780 --> 01:08:50.250
Exactly.

750
01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:54.970
Let's go! I'm dizzy because of all these books.

751
01:08:57.290 --> 01:09:05.390
Don't we need to re-activate Geumganggo...?

752
01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:07.220
Huh?

753
01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:15.400
This time, it's definitely not a calamity.

754
01:09:24.730 --> 01:09:32.490
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to you by 
 The Monkey Minions @ Viki</i>

755
01:09:32.490 --> 01:09:33.700
Activation.

756
01:09:42.070 --> 01:09:44.410
That wasn't enough to activate it.
