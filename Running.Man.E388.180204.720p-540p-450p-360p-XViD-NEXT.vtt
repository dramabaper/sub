00:00:09.515 --> 00:00:16.250
(Jeju Island, the dreamland, is everlastingly exotic.)

2
00:00:19.155 --> 00:00:20.750
- Hello. - Hi, everyone.

3
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:21.780
- Hi. - Hello.

4
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.420
- Hello. - Hello, everyone.

5
00:00:23.735 --> 00:00:26.520
Did you sleep well? Good morning. Hey, Mi Yeon.

6
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.660
- Hi. - Hello.

7
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.320
- Hi. - Morning, everyone.

8
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.330
- Hello. - Hi.

9
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.060
It's been a while since we last filmed in Jeju Island,

10
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.870
but it's snowing hard here, and there's a strong gust of wind.

11
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.140
- It's hailing. - Just in case...

12
00:00:39.375 --> 00:00:43.410
(The biting gust of wind pierces from the morning.)

13
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.710
(On top of that, it's hailing hard.)

14
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.250
He's worried that the flights might be canceled.

15
00:00:50.255 --> 00:00:52.950
The producer told me that we were going to start our shoot early...

16
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.550
- because he had another shoot next. - That's right.

17
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.020
- If it's canceled, it'd be bad. - Right.

18
00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.590
Seok Jin was feeling nervous and asked him this question quietly.

19
00:00:59.595 --> 00:01:04.030
"Chul Min, can I go poop?"

20
00:01:05.305 --> 00:01:06.860
Seok Jin asked Chul Min that given the current state?

21
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.470
Why would he ask for permission to poop?

22
00:01:08.475 --> 00:01:10.570
- My goodness. - It's because we had to hurry.

23
00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.930
You could've just gone without asking.

24
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.300
- Seok Jin. Seriously. - Even kids go without asking.

25
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.040
- You're over 50 years old now. - It's because we have to hurry.

26
00:01:17.115 --> 00:01:19.640
How could you ask someone younger than you for permission?

27
00:01:19.915 --> 00:01:21.410
- Hey. - Would you not poop if he said no?

28
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.680
- The entire staff were waiting. - My goodness.

29
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.120
- No one has done that to poop. - Seriously.

30
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.220
Today's race is a partner race called Rule of Collection.

31
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.760
(Rule of Collection)

32
00:01:34.805 --> 00:01:37.690
You'll receive a black pig gift set for the winning prize.

33
00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.330
- Okay. Let's win this. - Black pig.

34
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.330
Jeju Island is famous for that.

35
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.260
You will compete for the black pig gift set and the water bomb.

36
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.770
- Water bomb? - Water bomb? With today's weather?

37
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.210
It's hailing today.

38
00:01:48.945 --> 00:01:52.570
(The water bomb with the biting wind...)

39
00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.980
(and the high-end, black pig gift set are at stake for the race.)

40
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.310
First of all, let us present you female guests who have flown...

41
00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.850
- all the way here to join the race. - It must've taken a lot of effort.

42
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.350
- All right. - Yes, I agree.

43
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.790
Please come on out.

44
00:02:03.795 --> 00:02:05.690
- Come out, angels. - Please come on out!

45
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.260
I'm so thankful they came here.

46
00:02:07.265 --> 00:02:08.560
(Wait, this song is...)

47
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.760
Lyrics go, "It's the night I want to spend with you".

48
00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.530
("Good Time" by Cleo)

49
00:02:12.075 --> 00:02:14.700
(It's the night I want to spend with you)

50
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.800
- This is her song. - With you

51
00:02:15.905 --> 00:02:17.300
Here she comes.

52
00:02:17.875 --> 00:02:18.930
(It's So Min's song.)

53
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:19.930
It's So Min?

54
00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.010
(She sang it in her school days.)

55
00:02:21.715 --> 00:02:23.640
(She dances like she's back in school.)

56
00:02:23.915 --> 00:02:25.380
Why is she circling her hands?

57
00:02:26.115 --> 00:02:27.880
- I see Ji Hyo. - So Min.

58
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.980
Did you see Ji Hyo? She walked out and went like this.

59
00:02:30.725 --> 00:02:32.910
- What's wrong with Ji Hyo? - She's a ghost.

60
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.750
(A shadowy ghost is behind So Min.)

61
00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:35.780
- What's up with her? - So Min!

62
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.120
I didn't know, but we were supposed to come out together.

63
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.390
- Really? - Yes.

64
00:02:39.465 --> 00:02:40.890
- Hurry. - What's going on?

65
00:02:41.335 --> 00:02:43.130
I saw you dancing right away when the song was played.

66
00:02:43.535 --> 00:02:46.230
(I couldn't help it. It's my favorite song.)

67
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.930
Ji Hyo looks like she's going camping today.

68
00:02:49.005 --> 00:02:52.230
I bundled up because it's snowing a lot in Jeju Island.

69
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.610
- You don't dress up for us anymore. - She doesn't care anymore.

70
00:02:55.315 --> 00:02:56.770
She looks like a lumberjack.

71
00:02:57.115 --> 00:02:59.710
You're the one to talk. Look at you. Are you in the army or what?

72
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.640
(She gets infuriated.)

73
00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.980
- Fine. I'm in the service. - Are you?

74
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.320
- Yes, I'm in the army. - Go fulfill your military duty.

75
00:03:05.525 --> 00:03:07.580
No, his jacket is the carrot, and his hat is the root of it.

76
00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.780
(No, his jacket is the carrot, and his hat is the root of it.)

77
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.590
What? The root of a carrot? Don't you dare call me that!

78
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.350
I was talking about your hat.

79
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.190
- Stop it. - Watch every word, So Min.

80
00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.560
- We should bring in another guest. - Here we go.

81
00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.660
- We are just getting started. - Okay.

82
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.870
- Can you still smell my cologne? - Yes.

83
00:03:22.875 --> 00:03:25.070
What is happening? It's a quiet song.

84
00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:26.530
(The entrance song is quite calm.)

85
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:27.570
What?

86
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:28.840
(Who is the first female guest?)

87
00:03:31.585 --> 00:03:32.770
(A tall, multitalented actress)

88
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.810
- That's Lee Da Hee. - Really?

89
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.810
(Lee Da Hee, a tall, multitalented actress)

90
00:03:37.395 --> 00:03:41.120
(Her build is superior, but her acting is more superior.)

91
00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.820
(She showed her superiority on variety shows too.)

92
00:03:45.095 --> 00:03:48.160
- I haven't seen you in ages. - Hey, long time no see.

93
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.320
- Hey. - Do you know each other?

94
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.060
- We've met a long time ago. - Of course.

95
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.030
- How do you know each other? - A long time ago, Da Hee...

96
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.300
was on "Open Your Heart" or a program similar to that.

97
00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.870
- Weren't you on variety shows? - Wait, so...

98
00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.700
- I haven't met you. - Really? We haven't?

99
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.570
(He's flustered.)

100
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.640
- What's the matter with him? - Why do you pretend you know her?

101
00:04:07.025 --> 00:04:10.350
- He talked like we'd met, - I was just welcoming her.

102
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.650
- but I've never met him. - It sounds like you've been well.

103
00:04:12.695 --> 00:04:14.190
You got taller.

104
00:04:14.465 --> 00:04:16.850
- What's wrong with him? - She said she'd never met you.

105
00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.550
I remember skipping ropes with you.

106
00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:21.590
- Skipping ropes? Come on. - We even played the marble game.

107
00:04:22.035 --> 00:04:25.560
- Da Hee has joined us. Who's next? - Great!

108
00:04:25.805 --> 00:04:27.530
(They're expectant.)

109
00:04:27.675 --> 00:04:29.500
- Okay. - What's this song?

110
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.670
Wait, the song sounds a bit...

111
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.030
(She shows up with a trendy song.)

112
00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.640
- Who is it? - It's Koo Ha Ra.

113
00:04:34.385 --> 00:04:36.110
- It's Koo Ha Ra. - Koo Ha Ra!

114
00:04:37.255 --> 00:04:39.510
(She's the cute and sexy fairy of the Korean Wave.)

115
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.040
(Unexpectedly, she's an athletic singer with a strong will to win.)

116
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.110
Kwang Soo, it's Koo Ha Ra! It's Ha Ra!

117
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.310
- My gosh. - What's going on with you?

118
00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.150
- Hey. - Why? Do you like her?

119
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:49.150
Do you like her?

120
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.150
(Her return has shaken the fans.)

121
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.950
- Ha Ra. - It's been so long, Ha Ra.

122
00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.320
- No way. - It's Ha Ra.

123
00:04:53.505 --> 00:04:55.860
- Long time, no see. - My gosh, it's Koo Ha Ra.

124
00:04:55.905 --> 00:04:58.530
- It's nice to see you all. - How have you been?

125
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.130
It's been years, Ha Ra. I think Se Chan is a big fan.

126
00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:02.260
- I'm a big fan. - Really?

127
00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.770
- He's over the moon. - I was so shocked.

128
00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.600
- Since when were you her fan? - Ever since she was in Kara.

129
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.140
- Really? - Yes.

130
00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.670
- We have amazing guests today. - Seriously.

131
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:12.440
- I agree. - What's going on today?

132
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.880
- The airport must've been hectic. - It's been years, Ha Ra.

133
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.980
- Let's bring in the next guest. - Okay.

134
00:05:17.725 --> 00:05:19.750
(The entrance song is hip.)

135
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.150
(Did a hip guest join the show?)

136
00:05:22.165 --> 00:05:23.820
- Seor In A! - Seor In A!

137
00:05:23.965 --> 00:05:26.360
(Seor In A, a rising star in the limelight)

138
00:05:26.595 --> 00:05:28.220
- Seor In A is an actress. - Seor In A.

139
00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.290
(Seor In A, a rising star in the limelight)

140
00:05:29.865 --> 00:05:34.400
(She is the super rookie of the year who was searched the most online.)

141
00:05:34.975 --> 00:05:37.040
Long time, no see!

142
00:05:37.115 --> 00:05:38.900
(He pretends to know her too.)

143
00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.170
Did you say, "Long time, no see"?

144
00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:42.340
- I didn't see you since the awards. - Again?

145
00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:43.670
- Did you see her at the awards? - Yes.

146
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:45.780
- We have one last guest. - We won't interview her?

147
00:05:45.915 --> 00:05:48.150
- All right. Come on out! - It's Mina.

148
00:05:48.925 --> 00:05:50.150
She's in Gugudan.

149
00:05:50.395 --> 00:05:52.410
- Gugudan! - Long time, no see!

150
00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:53.410
She's in Gugudan.

151
00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:54.620
(She's the cutie of Gugudan.)

152
00:05:55.095 --> 00:05:56.620
- Awesome. - Yes, dance for us!

153
00:05:57.465 --> 00:05:59.320
- This is incredible! - We have an idol singer!

154
00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.660
- She's much better. - She dances much better.

155
00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:02.760
(Mina, cutie of Gugudan)

156
00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:03.900
She's excellent.

157
00:06:04.205 --> 00:06:06.060
(She is a member of Gugudan and released her own album.)

158
00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.500
(Mina, the refreshing singer, is charming the music industry.)

159
00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.470
I memorized the multiplication tables a lot in elementary school.

160
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.410
(He makes a pun with the name, Gugudan.)

161
00:06:14.715 --> 00:06:15.770
What's gotten into him today?

162
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.310
- What's wrong? - He's acting so lame.

163
00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.180
- I'm a huge fan. I'm serious. - That's enough.

164
00:06:20.215 --> 00:06:21.680
You're my only favorite idol singer.

165
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.750
- I'm serious. - Four guests have gathered here.

166
00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.480
- Right. - Welcome, everyone!

167
00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.920
(We welcome you with passion.)

168
00:06:30.635 --> 00:06:33.890
- Let's interview them one by one. - Okay.

169
00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:35.360
First up is Lee Da Hee!

170
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.530
(Let's start with Lee Da Hee.)

171
00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.770
Da Hee debuted in 2002 as a model.

172
00:06:41.745 --> 00:06:43.330
This is the 17th year of her career.

173
00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:44.930
That's impressive.

174
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:46.700
That's incredible.

175
00:06:47.215 --> 00:06:50.240
You were recently on "The Law of Jungle".

176
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.510
Wasn't it hard?

177
00:06:52.515 --> 00:06:54.040
- I had fun. - Really?

178
00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.080
I want to go again.

179
00:06:57.255 --> 00:06:58.780
She is picking her nose!

180
00:07:00.625 --> 00:07:02.750
(She is flustered.)

181
00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.120
She is picking her nose!

182
00:07:04.735 --> 00:07:06.450
What is wrong with him?

183
00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:07.660
She scratched her nose.

184
00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.690
She didn't pick her nose.

185
00:07:09.905 --> 00:07:12.760
- Why would Da Hee pick her nose? - For goodness' sake.

186
00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.900
Okay. I am sorry.

187
00:07:14.975 --> 00:07:17.540
I am wearing an angora top, and fur keeps getting on my face.

188
00:07:17.875 --> 00:07:19.400
Then did you really pick your nose?

189
00:07:20.785 --> 00:07:21.970
No.

190
00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:24.970
(She is flustered for the 2nd time.)

191
00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:26.110
Did fur go into her nose?

192
00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:27.610
- She picked fur out of her nose. - Really?

193
00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:28.810
Fur went into her nose.

194
00:07:28.985 --> 00:07:30.240
(This is a unique way to treat a guest.)

195
00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.310
The thing is,

196
00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:34.480
both Kwang Soo and Da Hee debuted as models.

197
00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.450
Have you met her before?

198
00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:38.390
No, this is my first time meeting her.

199
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:39.830
Didn't you work as a model?

200
00:07:39.835 --> 00:07:41.260
Da Hee, tell us.

201
00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.430
I didn't get to work much as a model.

202
00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:46.490
Kwang Soo, you were famous.

203
00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:47.800
- No. - No?

204
00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.030
- Not really. - Really?

205
00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:51.670
I joined the fashion show only once.

206
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:53.600
- I did, too. - Really?

207
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.040
- Me, too. - Really?

208
00:07:56.185 --> 00:07:57.740
Isn't that more of an experience?

209
00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:59.740
(Isn't that more of an experience?)

210
00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:01.010
When did you debut?

211
00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:02.610
Don't be so harsh.

212
00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:04.250
- Don't be so harsh. - It's not like that.

213
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:05.380
What is up with you today?

214
00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:06.610
I can't believe you.

215
00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:08.220
(Pictures from the days they experienced a modeling career)

216
00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.420
What is up with you today?

217
00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:10.520
Kwang Soo is just a tall man.

218
00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.350
- He is just a tall man. - Don't say you were a model.

219
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:13.550
- Stop it. - You weren't much of a model.

220
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:16.160
I heard that Da Hee can sing.

221
00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.600
- Is she a good singer? - She is a good singer.

222
00:08:18.005 --> 00:08:19.790
- Let's hear her sing. - Da Hee.

223
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:21.460
I heard that you can sing.

224
00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:23.630
When we ask the guests to sing,

225
00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:25.630
- they usually go, "No, no." - That's right.

226
00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:26.970
I don't get many chances to sing.

227
00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:28.740
- This is a good opportunity. - Really?

228
00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:31.180
- That's great. - Please sing a song.

229
00:08:31.415 --> 00:08:33.040
Most guests hate it.

230
00:08:34.585 --> 00:08:35.810
(Breathing out)

231
00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:37.850
Please be quiet. Let's hear her sing.

232
00:08:40.595 --> 00:08:41.950
It's very

233
00:08:43.195 --> 00:08:45.420
Why don't you sing some other time?

234
00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:46.890
(Considerate)

235
00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:49.330
- Your throat is in a bad condition. - No, it's in a good condition.

236
00:08:49.335 --> 00:08:50.560
What was that?

237
00:08:51.075 --> 00:08:52.530
Is it because of the fur?

238
00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:53.730
Could it be because of your angora top?

239
00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:55.100
Why don't you jump to the chorus?

240
00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:57.000
Take us to the highlight.

241
00:08:57.075 --> 00:08:59.140
I can't stop her when she wants to sing.

242
00:08:59.175 --> 00:09:00.870
In 2, 3.

243
00:09:02.145 --> 00:09:04.040
The act of waiting

244
00:09:04.085 --> 00:09:05.270
What should I do?

245
00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:08.510
(What should I do?)

246
00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:09.950
You failed!

247
00:09:09.955 --> 00:09:12.510
- You failed! - Your throat is in a bad condition.

248
00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:15.020
Isn't her participation in the OST more of an experience?

249
00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:17.490
(Isn't her participation in the OST more of an experience?)

250
00:09:17.495 --> 00:09:18.650
Don't say that.

251
00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:20.620
That's no way to treat a guest!

252
00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:21.860
- I am sorry. - Stop it already.

253
00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:24.500
- Do you want to see me angry? - I am sorry.

254
00:09:24.875 --> 00:09:26.530
This isn't the right time.

255
00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:28.430
The next guest is Seor In A.

256
00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:30.930
(The next guest is Seor In A.)

257
00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:32.830
In A tends to throw...

258
00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:36.000
- some profound words... - What are those words?

259
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.640
without thinking.

260
00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.140
- Those words have a ripple effect. - What are those words?

261
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:41.580
Here are some examples.

262
00:09:41.585 --> 00:09:43.640
"Actors are like nails."

263
00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.050
- Nails? - Why?

264
00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:46.320
I can't even laugh.

265
00:09:46.325 --> 00:09:48.180
Let's hear her reason.

266
00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:49.580
You grow nails.

267
00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:50.850
You cut nails.

268
00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:52.820
"Actors are like nails."

269
00:09:53.395 --> 00:09:56.530
You can cut the parts you don't like...

270
00:09:56.765 --> 00:09:59.500
and paint them in colors of your choice.

271
00:10:00.675 --> 00:10:03.370
(They are cringing.)

272
00:10:04.815 --> 00:10:08.470
I am sorry, but do you still have MySpace?

273
00:10:09.045 --> 00:10:10.200
Don't say anything.

274
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.480
Seriously.

275
00:10:11.785 --> 00:10:13.670
That's no way to treat a guest!

276
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:14.940
I got goosebumps.

277
00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:16.550
That's no way to treat a guest!

278
00:10:16.655 --> 00:10:18.720
- That's... - I am sorry, In A.

279
00:10:18.855 --> 00:10:20.820
She must have had sentimental posts.

280
00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:22.550
Exactly how old are you?

281
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:24.790
How old are you?

282
00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:26.550
I heard you were good at sports.

283
00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:28.100
In A,

284
00:10:28.105 --> 00:10:30.730
- you learned taekwondo, right? - Jiu jitsu?

285
00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:32.130
- Yes. - Did you learn jiu jitsu as well?

286
00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:33.970
I am learning jiu jitsu right now. I learned taekwondo in childhood.

287
00:10:34.675 --> 00:10:36.560
Are you good at kicks?

288
00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.100
In A, can you break wooden boards?

289
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:39.330
- Yes. - Would it be okay?

290
00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:40.700
Kwang Soo, please hold it up.

291
00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.010
She will kick it.

292
00:10:42.285 --> 00:10:44.240
- In A. - Yes.

293
00:10:45.815 --> 00:10:46.940
(Kicking)

294
00:10:47.625 --> 00:10:48.740
My goodness.

295
00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:49.980
(It hurts.)

296
00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:52.020
She kicked my hands.

297
00:10:54.465 --> 00:10:56.550
(I can't believe you kicked my hand, too.)

298
00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:58.560
She kicked my hand.

299
00:10:59.135 --> 00:11:00.590
- Are you okay? - She kicked his hand.

300
00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:02.290
Did I really kick your hand?

301
00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:03.560
- It shouldn't be too painful. - It's okay.

302
00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:05.030
She should have kicked the middle.

303
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:06.560
- Look. - Are you okay?

304
00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.870
She should have kicked the middle.

305
00:11:09.075 --> 00:11:10.600
- Look. - She kicked his hand.

306
00:11:10.645 --> 00:11:13.200
- I think she did. - She kicked his hand all right.

307
00:11:13.215 --> 00:11:15.200
The end broke.

308
00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.670
Why did you kick his hand?

309
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:18.310
- I must have aimed too high. - She obviously kicked his hand.

310
00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:19.770
Kwang Soo is the one at fault.

311
00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:21.540
He should have held up the wooden board higher.

312
00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:24.380
- In A has long legs. - That's right.

313
00:11:24.995 --> 00:11:26.750
- He should have held it up higher. - You are saying it's my fault...

314
00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:28.880
- for getting kicked. - That's right.

315
00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.760
- I got kicked. - It's your fault.

316
00:11:30.865 --> 00:11:33.690
In A has long legs. You should have held it up higher.

317
00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:34.790
(I am sorry, Kwang Soo.)

318
00:11:35.635 --> 00:11:37.260
I want to see a jiu jitsu demonstration.

319
00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.030
- Can you show us? - An arm bar.

320
00:11:39.275 --> 00:11:41.630
- Then I will have to twist someone. - Really?

321
00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:43.030
Why don't you twist Se Chan?

322
00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:44.970
- Me? - Yes.

323
00:11:45.175 --> 00:11:46.340
I mean...

324
00:11:46.415 --> 00:11:47.470
Let's do it this way.

325
00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:49.200
Think of yourself as a molester.

326
00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.910
- That's a good idea. - Yes.

327
00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:52.640
- What should he do? - I love this kind of a set-up.

328
00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:53.640
It suits him.

329
00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.010
When I walk,

330
00:11:55.255 --> 00:11:57.140
put your arm around me in a sneaky way.

331
00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:58.410
Okay. That's good.

332
00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:01.320
You can use the trick in real life.

333
00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:04.220
Everyone should learn.

334
00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:05.820
- He looks like a molester. - Go.

335
00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:07.190
(What kind of self-defense technique will the jiu jitsu master show?)

336
00:12:11.175 --> 00:12:12.500
She simply pushed him.

337
00:12:13.105 --> 00:12:15.860
(She twists his arm...)

338
00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:18.240
(and pushes him.)

339
00:12:18.415 --> 00:12:21.500
Anyone can do that.

340
00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:23.700
- It's a simple push. - Hold on.

341
00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:26.070
(It's a simple push.)

342
00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:27.540
Anyone can do that.

343
00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:29.380
This isn't jiu jitsu.

344
00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:30.610
She simply threw a fit.

345
00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:31.750
Try it on me.

346
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:32.780
- It's jiu jitsu. - She simply threw a fit.

347
00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:33.980
Anyone can do this.

348
00:12:34.265 --> 00:12:35.880
- Is this jiu jitsu? - Listen.

349
00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:37.250
- What was that? - It's a useful tip.

350
00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:39.160
- Didn't she simply throw a fit? - What do you think you are doing?

351
00:12:39.235 --> 00:12:40.590
Let's talk to the next guest.

352
00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:42.920
- The next guest is Mina. - Mina!

353
00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:45.030
- Mina is the best. - It's Mina.

354
00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:46.430
- She is the best. - She is the best.

355
00:12:46.575 --> 00:12:48.460
- In 2016, - I love the way her eyes crinkle.

356
00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:50.600
she debuted as a member of I.O.I.

357
00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:53.970
She now works diligently as a member of Gugudan.

358
00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:55.970
I heard that...

359
00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:58.470
Mina prepared a specialty at home.

360
00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:59.580
Really?

361
00:12:59.985 --> 00:13:01.680
- You did that for Running Man. - That's incredible.

362
00:13:01.685 --> 00:13:04.650
The members told me not to show it.

363
00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:06.150
What did you prepare?

364
00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:07.950
- A voice impression. - A voice impression.

365
00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:09.650
- A voice impression. - Although I practiced hard,

366
00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:11.050
- the members told me not to do it. - Really?

367
00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:12.360
Whom do you imitate?

368
00:13:12.895 --> 00:13:14.090
Well,

369
00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:17.600
- I imitate the rapper, Jolly V. - Jolly V.

370
00:13:18.675 --> 00:13:20.330
(Can she do a voice impression of Jolly V?)

371
00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:21.460
(She covers her mouth and imitates shyly.)

372
00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:22.800
I did this.

373
00:13:23.245 --> 00:13:25.670
It becomes a specialty if you don't cover your mouth.

374
00:13:25.745 --> 00:13:27.500
- You shouldn't cover your mouth. - Really?

375
00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:29.640
- Please try again. - I will give it another try.

376
00:13:30.615 --> 00:13:35.780
(She shows her face.)

377
00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:37.510
That's hilarious.

378
00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:39.580
- Mina, that's the way to do it. - That's hilarious.

379
00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:41.420
- Her mouth looked funny. - For a successful specialty,

380
00:13:41.425 --> 00:13:43.250
you shouldn't cover your mouth.

381
00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:44.720
(Jae Seok's coaching leaves the student satisfied.)

382
00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.190
She is cute.

383
00:13:47.095 --> 00:13:49.230
(Does he think it's cute?)

384
00:13:49.635 --> 00:13:50.990
(She does it in a depressing way.)

385
00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:52.890
How do you do it?

386
00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:54.830
Try, "You jerk."

387
00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:56.670
Do a voice impression of Joo Hyun.

388
00:13:57.045 --> 00:13:58.270
For goodness' sake.

389
00:13:58.345 --> 00:14:00.100
Stay out of it, you jerk.

390
00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:01.170
(She is good at this.)

391
00:14:01.385 --> 00:14:04.140
That's really annoying.

392
00:14:04.855 --> 00:14:06.710
"Stay out of it, you jerk."

393
00:14:06.715 --> 00:14:08.680
The next guest is a singer who debuted 10 years ago.

394
00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:09.910
What a surprise!

395
00:14:10.255 --> 00:14:11.780
Koo Ha Ra!

396
00:14:12.495 --> 00:14:14.390
Koo Ha Ra!

397
00:14:14.395 --> 00:14:16.520
Ha Ra said this...

398
00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:17.920
back in the days.

399
00:14:18.365 --> 00:14:20.460
Do you remember saying this?

400
00:14:20.595 --> 00:14:23.520
"I want to get married at the age of 36."

401
00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.400
- 36? - 36?

402
00:14:25.875 --> 00:14:27.330
Do you think differently now?

403
00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:29.100
(What is your stand on it now?)

404
00:14:29.475 --> 00:14:32.930
(Ha Ra wanted to get married at the age of 36.)

405
00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:34.870
(Does she still wish the same?)

406
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:37.370
I don't want to get married anymore.

407
00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:42.180
(I don't want to get married anymore.)

408
00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:43.480
Those jerks!

409
00:14:44.495 --> 00:14:45.750
Those jerks!

410
00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:47.950
(Who hurt her?)

411
00:14:47.995 --> 00:14:50.020
Kwang Soo, stop it.

412
00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:51.350
- Don't make assumptions. - Okay.

413
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:53.590
- It was all in my imagination. - You must have been hurt.

414
00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:54.860
- It was all in my imagination. - For goodness' sake.

415
00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:56.320
Women always meet a nice man...

416
00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:57.630
- after pieces of trash. - Stop it.

417
00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:58.730
(He makes assumptions.)

418
00:14:58.730 --> 00:14:59.990
- Stop it. - It's like that.

419
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:01.200
Stop it.

420
00:15:01.705 --> 00:15:03.230
- It's exhausting, right? - Yes.

421
00:15:03.545 --> 00:15:05.530
- I am sorry, Ha Ra. - It's okay.

422
00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:07.370
I think I will have fun today.

423
00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:09.240
(It's thanks to the male members.)

424
00:15:09.245 --> 00:15:10.410
That's right.

425
00:15:10.485 --> 00:15:12.910
I think she will say...

426
00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:15.510
what you said during the flight.

427
00:15:15.925 --> 00:15:17.110
"Those jerks."

428
00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:20.680
(The members of Running Man, those jerks.)

429
00:15:21.425 --> 00:15:23.650
"The members of Running Man, those jerks."

430
00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:25.320
(Let's hope she won't get hurt by the members of Running Man.)

431
00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:26.990
"Those jerks."

432
00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:29.560
I don't know whom those words will direct.

433
00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:32.570
Now, let's choose the partners...

434
00:15:32.575 --> 00:15:36.400
for these six women.

435
00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:37.460
This is nerve-wracking.

436
00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:39.210
The rules are simple.

437
00:15:39.215 --> 00:15:43.100
Each female member will come out...

438
00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:46.340
and say, "I like someone who is..."

439
00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:48.840
If the condition applies to you, step forward.

440
00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:51.880
When you do that, you have to squat walk.

441
00:15:51.895 --> 00:15:55.150
If your hands leave your ears, you are out.

442
00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:58.090
If your hands stay on your ears even if you fall, you are in.

443
00:15:58.435 --> 00:15:59.750
What if your hands leave...

444
00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:00.850
with your ears?

445
00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:03.160
(What if your hands leave with your ears?)

446
00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:04.230
- What? - What happens then?

447
00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:05.730
Your hands leave with your ears.

448
00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:07.830
- Then you are out. - You are out.

449
00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:09.040
I will be careful not to do that.

450
00:16:09.045 --> 00:16:11.030
- We will need strong ears. - You are out...

451
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:13.100
- if you hold your torn ears. - You are out.

452
00:16:13.215 --> 00:16:16.640
(Let's decide on the partners.)

453
00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.280
- Everyone, - Yes.

454
00:16:18.285 --> 00:16:19.910
once you reach this zone,

455
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:21.720
the woman will make a decision.

456
00:16:21.725 --> 00:16:23.610
- The woman will make a decision. - That's right.

457
00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:25.020
This is nerve-wracking.

458
00:16:25.625 --> 00:16:27.050
Which one...

459
00:16:27.155 --> 00:16:29.220
should we start with?

460
00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:30.320
Who wants to go first?

461
00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.950
- Me. - Koo Ha Ra.

462
00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:33.890
(Ha Ra volunteers.)

463
00:16:34.535 --> 00:16:36.260
This is like the final round.

464
00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:37.690
- She's very confident. - Gosh.

465
00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:39.190
- From the start... - It's like finals.

466
00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:40.670
From the start...

467
00:16:40.675 --> 00:16:41.830
It's already beginning.

468
00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:43.330
Say what you look for in your partner.

469
00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:44.840
- Okay. - Okay.

470
00:16:46.275 --> 00:16:48.010
- She's so relaxed. - Yes.

471
00:16:48.015 --> 00:16:49.170
She's a veteran.

472
00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:50.770
She came back very relaxed.

473
00:16:50.785 --> 00:16:52.070
Ready,

474
00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:53.410
start.

475
00:16:53.515 --> 00:16:54.710
I...

476
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:57.310
(What does Ha Ra look for in her partner?)

477
00:16:57.310 --> 00:17:00.850
(I...)

478
00:17:00.855 --> 00:17:06.250
(What is her dream partner like?)

479
00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:10.630
I want someone in a black outfit.

480
00:17:10.805 --> 00:17:14.130
(Se Chan, Jong Kook, Haha)

481
00:17:16.475 --> 00:17:19.340
(Those in black squat walk forward.)

482
00:17:20.375 --> 00:17:22.370
(Black?)

483
00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:25.080
(I'm wearing black inside.)

484
00:17:26.585 --> 00:17:27.980
I'm not wearing any black.

485
00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:29.280
(Those not in black become restless.)

486
00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:31.820
(I'm not wearing black either.)

487
00:17:32.295 --> 00:17:35.080
(Wait, my undershirt is black.)

488
00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.250
That's black. Take your sweater off.

489
00:17:37.935 --> 00:17:39.320
Good.

490
00:17:39.865 --> 00:17:41.060
That's black.

491
00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:42.490
You're late.

492
00:17:42.565 --> 00:17:44.230
- It's over. - Hold on.

493
00:17:45.205 --> 00:17:46.660
(Curious)

494
00:17:46.935 --> 00:17:49.470
- Your hands are off your ears. - Oh, my.

495
00:17:49.645 --> 00:17:53.540
- It's over. - I'm wearing black.

496
00:17:55.185 --> 00:17:56.300
Oh, my.

497
00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:59.040
- I'm wearing black. - It's over.

498
00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:00.810
It's over.

499
00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:03.780
Please turn around on the count of three.

500
00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:05.510
1, 2, 3.

501
00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:06.750
(It's time to see the candidates.)

502
00:18:07.525 --> 00:18:09.390
(Many came.)

503
00:18:09.695 --> 00:18:11.390
- Ha Ra. - Ha Ra.

504
00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:13.390
- Ha Ra. - Please push the ones...

505
00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:15.890
you don't like one by one.

506
00:18:16.065 --> 00:18:17.890
1, 2...

507
00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:21.330
(The candidates are Se Chan, Jong Kook, Haha, and Seok Jin.)

508
00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:24.770
(You can push the ones you don't like out.)

509
00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:25.830
1, 2, 3.

510
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:30.280
(Sorry, Seok Jin.)

511
00:18:30.285 --> 00:18:32.870
She hit his head first.

512
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:35.550
- Next. - Well...

513
00:18:36.085 --> 00:18:38.510
- Next. - Kwang Soo, I still have a chance.

514
00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:43.090
(Excited)

515
00:18:43.365 --> 00:18:49.360
(Se Chan, Ha Ra's old fan, was so happy to see her today.)

516
00:18:50.035 --> 00:18:53.260
(Will Se Chan make it to the finals?)

517
00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:54.570
Haha.

518
00:18:55.375 --> 00:18:58.270
- Haha. - Do you need help?

519
00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:01.710
(Haha is eliminated.)

520
00:19:02.145 --> 00:19:03.570
(I'm sorry.)

521
00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:06.140
- Now... - Ha Ra, see what happens.

522
00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:07.580
(Petty)

523
00:19:08.585 --> 00:19:10.150
- See what happens. - Haha.

524
00:19:10.155 --> 00:19:11.880
- See if your cold will go away. - Exactly.

525
00:19:12.555 --> 00:19:13.820
Oh, my.

526
00:19:14.795 --> 00:19:16.820
- Se Chan versus Jong Kook. - Se Chan, you can do this.

527
00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:17.960
Ha Ra.

528
00:19:17.965 --> 00:19:19.820
It's finals.

529
00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:21.290
I've made it to the finals.

530
00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:23.690
(I've made it to finals.)

531
00:19:24.165 --> 00:19:27.660
(Ha Ra, Se Chan's crush for years, is right in front of him.)

532
00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:30.070
(But his opponent is Jong Kook.)

533
00:19:30.605 --> 00:19:33.200
(Whom will Ha Ra choose?)

534
00:19:33.545 --> 00:19:35.000
Okay!

535
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.900
(Se Chan is eliminated.)

536
00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:39.510
I knew it. What was I hoping for?

537
00:19:39.555 --> 00:19:42.240
- Okay. - You made it to second place.

538
00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:43.710
I knew it.

539
00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:44.750
Of course.

540
00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:46.780
- Jong Kook and Ha Ra. - Okay.

541
00:19:46.955 --> 00:19:48.180
Okay.

542
00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:50.560
Next, So Min.

543
00:19:50.565 --> 00:19:52.050
Me? Should I go first?

544
00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:53.420
(It's So Min's turn now.)

545
00:19:54.235 --> 00:19:56.660
(Uninterested)

546
00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:58.930
I feel no excitement at all.

547
00:19:59.505 --> 00:20:02.630
- Say exactly what you want. - Say what you want first.

548
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:04.300
I want...

549
00:20:06.215 --> 00:20:08.640
someone very generous.

550
00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.970
(I want someone very generous.)

551
00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:13.970
- I'm very sensitive these days. - I'm so petty.

552
00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:16.110
- I'm really petty. - I'm so petty...

553
00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:18.110
- that my wife complains about it. - I'm petty.

554
00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:19.910
- I'm so petty. - So Min.

555
00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:21.450
(Forget it.)

556
00:20:21.825 --> 00:20:24.890
- Oh, my. - This is how it works?

557
00:20:24.995 --> 00:20:26.490
- We're all petty. - Can't you say something else?

558
00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:28.420
- I'm petty. - I'm really petty.

559
00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:30.790
I want...

560
00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:32.960
(Second try)

561
00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.900
I want someone handsome.

562
00:20:34.905 --> 00:20:37.470
- I'm not handsome. - I'm ugly.

563
00:20:37.575 --> 00:20:39.130
No one is handsome.

564
00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:40.230
So Min.

565
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:41.900
(They try their best to look ugly.)

566
00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:43.600
Look at Haha.

567
00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.410
You guys are so mean.

568
00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:47.340
(I can't believe them.)

569
00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:48.880
- You'll have to wait. - Hey.

570
00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.650
(Just give up.)

571
00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:52.650
Are you serious?

572
00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:55.720
- Try again later. - I can't give up.

573
00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:57.150
Come on.

574
00:20:57.150 --> 00:20:58.850
- I want... - Go back.

575
00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:00.690
- I want. - Stop it.

576
00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:04.990
I want someone short and old with a flat bottom and a pouty mouth.

577
00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:10.570
(I want someone short and old, with a flat bottom and a pouty mouth.)

578
00:21:10.945 --> 00:21:13.330
Stop it.

579
00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:15.010
Calm down.

580
00:21:15.515 --> 00:21:17.140
They're so mean.

581
00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:18.740
This is how it works?

582
00:21:19.255 --> 00:21:21.510
Unfortunately, So Min...

583
00:21:21.555 --> 00:21:24.150
failed to find a partner.

584
00:21:24.285 --> 00:21:26.410
It's Da Hee's turn now.

585
00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:27.710
(Da Hee will find a partner.)

586
00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:29.150
She and Kwang Soo will make a great team.

587
00:21:29.425 --> 00:21:30.980
Please say what you look for.

588
00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:34.860
(What is Da Hee's dream partner like?)

589
00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:39.330
I want someone not younger than me.

590
00:21:39.435 --> 00:21:42.560
(Se Chan is younger than Da Hee.)

591
00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:44.700
Hold on. Do you mean everyone except me?

592
00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:45.900
That's right.

593
00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:48.000
- Kwang Soo is your age. - That's okay.

594
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.500
I'll just stay here.

595
00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:51.710
(I'll just stay here.)

596
00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:52.740
Don't take it personally.

597
00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:54.810
You could have just said you wanted anyone but me.

598
00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:57.310
- I mean... - Don't take it personally.

599
00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:59.610
He welcomed all the guests...

600
00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:00.880
- except me. - Is that why?

601
00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:02.220
- He didn't welcome me. - I see.

602
00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:03.750
All right.

603
00:22:03.795 --> 00:22:05.350
Everyone except Se Chan.

604
00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:07.820
Se Chan, you can still...

605
00:22:07.935 --> 00:22:09.320
- try. - I can?

606
00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:10.590
- It doesn't matter. - Of course.

607
00:22:11.135 --> 00:22:13.200
Ready, start.

608
00:22:13.435 --> 00:22:16.160
(It's time to choose.)

609
00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:19.200
(Everyone welcomed Da Hee.)

610
00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.840
(How many will be there?)

611
00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.140
Da Hee, please turn around. 1, 2, 3.

612
00:22:24.485 --> 00:22:27.610
(Only the one younger than her is here.)

613
00:22:28.355 --> 00:22:30.310
(Cold)

614
00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:31.920
Hold on.

615
00:22:32.755 --> 00:22:35.080
(Why is he here?)

616
00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:36.550
Hold on.

617
00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:39.860
Hold on. This is just too much.

618
00:22:40.035 --> 00:22:42.460
This is too much.

619
00:22:43.065 --> 00:22:44.790
Da Hee. Hold on.

620
00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:46.190
It's not like that.

621
00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:48.300
She looked like Ha Jung Woo in "The Chaser".

622
00:22:49.905 --> 00:22:53.600
(Is there a hammer or a club?)

623
00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:55.540
I'm hurt.

624
00:22:55.685 --> 00:22:56.900
Seriously...

625
00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:58.280
What is this?

626
00:22:58.315 --> 00:23:00.540
You're not the only one who got hurt.

627
00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:02.340
- Da Hee is hurt too. - She is?

628
00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:03.650
You're both hurt.

629
00:23:03.725 --> 00:23:05.610
Don't think we'll go for everyone.

630
00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:07.080
We're hard to please.

631
00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:08.760
We're very picky.

632
00:23:08.765 --> 00:23:11.180
If I don't choose anyone now,

633
00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:13.190
I might end up becoming...

634
00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:15.260
- Seok Jin's partner, right? - Yes.

635
00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:16.660
I don't want that.

636
00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:18.730
(I don't want that.)

637
00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:20.530
- So... - What's going on?

638
00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:22.030
- What are you doing? - Hey.

639
00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:23.430
Seok Jin didn't do anything.

640
00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:25.170
- I don't like you. - What's wrong?

641
00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:27.470
- So... - I don't like you.

642
00:23:27.915 --> 00:23:30.370
- I can't believe her. - Seok Jin didn't do anything.

643
00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:31.980
- I didn't do anything. - It's bad enough now,

644
00:23:32.055 --> 00:23:33.750
but do you think it might get worse?

645
00:23:33.755 --> 00:23:35.080
(Does it show?)

646
00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:36.140
I don't like you.

647
00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:37.350
She's the best.

648
00:23:38.095 --> 00:23:39.710
If...

649
00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:43.590
Da Hee pushes Se Chan out, they won't become a team.

650
00:23:43.595 --> 00:23:44.760
One,

651
00:23:45.565 --> 00:23:46.650
two...

652
00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:49.390
(Da Hee is cornered. Will she choose Se Chan?)

653
00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:50.490
Three.

654
00:23:51.605 --> 00:23:56.600
(Se Chan and Da Hee)

655
00:23:56.745 --> 00:23:59.600
Anyway, Da Hee and...

656
00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:02.040
Se Chan are a team now.

657
00:24:03.545 --> 00:24:05.340
Next, In A.

658
00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:07.340
- In A. - In A.

659
00:24:07.955 --> 00:24:09.710
We're hard to please.

660
00:24:09.755 --> 00:24:11.980
- We're picky. - We are.

661
00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:14.920
- We know what we want. - Let's do this.

662
00:24:15.195 --> 00:24:16.780
I want...

663
00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:18.950
(I want...)

664
00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:22.720
I want someone wearing a cap.

665
00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:24.230
It's everyone.

666
00:24:25.005 --> 00:24:27.330
- Oh, no. - What are you doing?

667
00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:28.660
She's too easy.

668
00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:30.460
She's opening up my heart.

669
00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:32.970
- Should we go? - So Min changed the atmosphere.

670
00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:34.130
- Right? - Completely.

671
00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:36.470
- Ready... - What should we do?

672
00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:38.040
- Should we go? - It's driving me crazy.

673
00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:40.640
- Start. - Should we go?

674
00:24:40.885 --> 00:24:42.740
(They move forward.)

675
00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:43.850
They're moving.

676
00:24:44.325 --> 00:24:45.880
(Kicking)

677
00:24:46.855 --> 00:24:49.080
(Ji Hyo jumps in...)

678
00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:50.350
(and kicks Haha away.)

679
00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:51.520
What's happening?

680
00:24:51.635 --> 00:24:53.260
Are you okay?

681
00:24:53.265 --> 00:24:55.460
She kicked him in the jaw.

682
00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:57.990
- You're eliminated. - Wait.

683
00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:59.160
- What's with her? - You're eliminated.

684
00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:01.160
A gangster wouldn't do that.

685
00:25:01.205 --> 00:25:02.830
In A, turn around.

686
00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:05.840
1, 2, 3.

687
00:25:05.975 --> 00:25:07.270
Peekaboo.

688
00:25:07.545 --> 00:25:09.170
(Only you two?)

689
00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:12.480
Haha had an accident on the way.

690
00:25:12.815 --> 00:25:14.340
Ji Hyo won't leave me alone...

691
00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:16.550
whenever we do couple games.

692
00:25:16.925 --> 00:25:19.510
- You're mine. Don't do anything. - She's driving me crazy.

693
00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:21.980
1, 2, 3. Push someone out.

694
00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:23.750
- Push the one you don't like. - Push the one you don't like.

695
00:25:24.195 --> 00:25:26.220
- Oh, my. - Oh, my.

696
00:25:27.365 --> 00:25:30.060
(Wait, it means...)

697
00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:32.400
- What's this? - Unbelievable.

698
00:25:33.005 --> 00:25:34.260
- Wait. - What's happening?

699
00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:35.800
- Do you want to try again? - Unbelievable.

700
00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:36.970
Gosh.

701
00:25:37.145 --> 00:25:40.170
(Irritated)

702
00:25:41.175 --> 00:25:43.440
In A, please go back.

703
00:25:43.445 --> 00:25:46.570
- In A... - Kwang Soo thought he'd win.

704
00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:49.740
- It's Mina's turn now. - Mina.

705
00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:51.180
There will be a lot of competition.

706
00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:52.820
Mina is...

707
00:25:53.295 --> 00:25:55.380
Her smile is so pretty, right?

708
00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:56.920
Please say what you look for.

709
00:25:56.925 --> 00:25:58.490
I...

710
00:25:59.965 --> 00:26:02.190
want someone wearing a shirt.

711
00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:06.290
(I want someone wearing a shirt.)

712
00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:07.530
A shirt?

713
00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:10.330
(No one is wearing a shirt.)

714
00:26:10.575 --> 00:26:12.800
- A shirt? - It's you.

715
00:26:13.045 --> 00:26:15.010
Just say you want Jae Seok.

716
00:26:15.445 --> 00:26:16.800
(Just say you want Jae Seok.)

717
00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:17.910
Gosh.

718
00:26:18.755 --> 00:26:20.510
You hurt our pride.

719
00:26:20.715 --> 00:26:22.610
I can't find a shirt.

720
00:26:23.485 --> 00:26:25.280
All I'm wearing is an undershirt.

721
00:26:25.355 --> 00:26:26.510
This is...

722
00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:28.720
It's too obvious whom she wants.

723
00:26:28.865 --> 00:26:30.080
Ready.

724
00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:33.490
(There has been a lot of opposition.)

725
00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:34.890
(But Mina wants only Jae Seok.)

726
00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:37.060
(Mina is only loyal to Jae Seok with a collared shirt.)

727
00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:39.460
(Did Jae Seok come?)

728
00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:44.260
(She's disappointed.)

729
00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:45.770
- What's going on? - He just put it on.

730
00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:47.370
He wasn't wearing a collared shirt before.

731
00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:48.900
- Why is she upset? - She's not.

732
00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:50.240
- Am I that bad? - No.

733
00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:52.470
It may be because she likes you.

734
00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:54.070
- You weren't wearing a shirt. - "Am I that bad?"

735
00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:55.410
- Am I that bad? - Listen.

736
00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:56.510
(How can you react that way?)

737
00:26:57.155 --> 00:27:01.220
(Kwang Soo was rejected when he borrowed a shirt from the staff.)

738
00:27:01.795 --> 00:27:03.050
Listen.

739
00:27:03.725 --> 00:27:04.950
- Listen. - He's discouraged.

740
00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:08.090
Da Hee showed how she felt with her facial expression.

741
00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:09.160
However, Mina...

742
00:27:09.465 --> 00:27:12.990
(Her groaning explained her feelings.)

743
00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:14.500
Please sit down.

744
00:27:14.775 --> 00:27:19.170
- Mina, in 3, 2, 1. - The shirt looks borrowed.

745
00:27:19.515 --> 00:27:20.570
(Will you hold my hand?)

746
00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:21.940
They become a couple.

747
00:27:23.315 --> 00:27:24.980
- Mina and Kwang Soo are together. - Yes.

748
00:27:25.615 --> 00:27:26.780
Come on.

749
00:27:26.815 --> 00:27:28.350
Next is Ji Hyo.

750
00:27:28.985 --> 00:27:30.880
Her partner is obvious.

751
00:27:32.455 --> 00:27:34.480
However, we never know.

752
00:27:34.725 --> 00:27:36.520
All right, Ji Hyo.

753
00:27:37.525 --> 00:27:38.660
I can...

754
00:27:39.465 --> 00:27:42.530
(He's nervous.)

755
00:27:43.905 --> 00:27:45.990
I can make delicious food.

756
00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:48.960
(What is she saying all of a sudden?)

757
00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:50.830
- What do you mean? - What?

758
00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:52.400
Are you awake yet?

759
00:27:52.575 --> 00:27:53.900
You're not awake yet.

760
00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:56.100
- Ji Hyo. - You keep saying that I'm old.

761
00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:57.670
- Come on, Ji Hyo. - You keep saying that I'm old.

762
00:27:57.670 --> 00:28:00.340
This is choosing your partner. You startled me.

763
00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:01.470
Please answer again.

764
00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:02.710
Tell us, Ji Hyo.

765
00:28:03.385 --> 00:28:06.080
I like men who don't wear glasses.

766
00:28:06.825 --> 00:28:10.520
(Haha is the only one without glasses.)

767
00:28:12.995 --> 00:28:14.520
It's Haha.

768
00:28:15.035 --> 00:28:16.160
(Haha goes somewhere.)

769
00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:18.360
You can't borrow other people's items from now on.

770
00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:20.130
(He takes the camera director's glasses.)

771
00:28:20.705 --> 00:28:21.870
Wait.

772
00:28:22.305 --> 00:28:24.600
- You can't borrow things. - You can't.

773
00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:25.700
It's not allowed.

774
00:28:26.575 --> 00:28:27.630
You can't do that.

775
00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:28.970
(That's against the rules.)

776
00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:30.270
You can't borrow from other people.

777
00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:31.880
- You can't. - No.

778
00:28:32.215 --> 00:28:35.040
You can't borrow items from other people.

779
00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:36.210
(He brings a permanent marker.)

780
00:28:36.685 --> 00:28:37.980
Will you draw the glasses?

781
00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:39.350
(He plans to draw him a tattoo.)

782
00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:40.850
- Do it for me. - Really?

783
00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:42.320
We aren't allowed to borrow.

784
00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.390
We can't borrow any items.

785
00:28:44.495 --> 00:28:46.250
(He starts to draw.)

786
00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:47.320
It's done.

787
00:28:48.765 --> 00:28:51.760
(I have glasses on, Ji Hyo.)

788
00:28:52.575 --> 00:28:56.730
(He even draws glasses with a permanent marker.)

789
00:28:57.845 --> 00:29:00.200
Then I change my mind.

790
00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:01.940
- To what? - Someone with glasses on.

791
00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:02.970
Someone with glasses on?

792
00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:05.040
(She wants a partner with glasses on.)

793
00:29:06.155 --> 00:29:10.940
(Someone with glasses on?)

794
00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:12.610
- Stop it. - May I change my mind to...

795
00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:14.590
- someone with glasses? - He can't erase them.

796
00:29:14.595 --> 00:29:16.420
If he meets the standard, he's required to come out.

797
00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:18.220
- It's required. - Stop it.

798
00:29:18.295 --> 00:29:20.990
That's enough, Haha.

799
00:29:21.465 --> 00:29:24.660
If you have glasses on, you must come out.

800
00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:26.060
(I took them off. It's all you.)

801
00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:27.930
She's been my partner for weeks.

802
00:29:28.745 --> 00:29:29.900
Ji Hyo!

803
00:29:30.205 --> 00:29:32.570
Why do you find me so attractive?

804
00:29:33.215 --> 00:29:36.840
Why me? I have two children, you punk.

805
00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:38.340
- Stop it. - I have two children, you punk.

806
00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:39.340
(Let me go.)

807
00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:40.510
You punk.

808
00:29:40.515 --> 00:29:42.250
You're full of charms.

809
00:29:42.655 --> 00:29:46.120
Start. You must come out.

810
00:29:46.555 --> 00:29:48.050
(Wait a minute.)

811
00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:49.050
What?

812
00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:51.450
(In A suddenly intercepts him.)

813
00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:52.450
- Take your hands off. - What?

814
00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:53.620
Why won't you?

815
00:29:53.765 --> 00:29:55.930
Wait, what's going on?

816
00:29:56.265 --> 00:29:58.600
What do you want me to do?

817
00:29:58.635 --> 00:30:00.170
- She used a self-defense technique. - Self-defense.

818
00:30:00.175 --> 00:30:01.230
That's self-defense.

819
00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:03.130
That was a self-defense technique.

820
00:30:03.375 --> 00:30:05.070
Did someone steal my partner?

821
00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:07.600
My goodness.

822
00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:09.700
(She pulls his hand away from his ear.)

823
00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:11.070
- He let go of his hands. - He's eliminated.

824
00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:12.640
(Haha is eliminated.)

825
00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:14.610
- You must be happy, Haha. - What happened?

826
00:30:15.455 --> 00:30:18.140
- Do you know what In A did? - Really?

827
00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:19.480
Come back to your place.

828
00:30:20.055 --> 00:30:21.450
Why did you save me suddenly?

829
00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:22.650
(Haha and In A become partners.)

830
00:30:22.795 --> 00:30:24.420
(Couples are formed.)

831
00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:27.290
Everyone has a partner after some difficulties.

832
00:30:27.295 --> 00:30:30.820
Here are the rules for Rule of Collection.

833
00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:34.430
(Race for Rule of Collection officially starts.)

834
00:30:34.575 --> 00:30:39.370
All partners pick a card numbered from 1 to 6.

835
00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:42.370
The team whose total is the highest...

836
00:30:42.370 --> 00:30:44.340
and the lowest win.

837
00:30:44.545 --> 00:30:46.380
The highest and the lowest win.

838
00:30:46.415 --> 00:30:48.680
Everyone except the winning two couples...

839
00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:50.510
(The rest will get a water bomb.)

840
00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:52.350
- Everyone else will get... - Everyone else?

841
00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:53.780
a water bomb.

842
00:30:54.195 --> 00:30:55.850
Only two couples can win.

843
00:30:55.850 --> 00:30:57.250
Only two couples will survive.

844
00:30:57.250 --> 00:31:00.790
The cards of the couple that comes in last will be revealed.

845
00:31:00.835 --> 00:31:03.930
(The cards of the couple that comes in last will be revealed.)

846
00:31:04.005 --> 00:31:07.330
One person of the winning couple finds out who has a certain card.

847
00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:09.860
- He may switch partners. - Switch partners?

848
00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:11.200
(There's a chance to switch partners.)

849
00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.370
Can you switch partners?

850
00:31:12.845 --> 00:31:15.240
- That's great. - We get to switch partners?

851
00:31:15.685 --> 00:31:18.170
- My goodness. - That's great.

852
00:31:18.170 --> 00:31:21.710
(What's the meaning behind your smile?)

853
00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:23.080
I'm sorry.

854
00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:24.640
(Wait, I'm sorry.)

855
00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:26.780
Da Hee is finally smiling.

856
00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:28.080
Da Hee looks so happy.

857
00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:29.950
She's so excited.

858
00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:31.420
She smiled very big.

859
00:31:31.525 --> 00:31:33.190
Did you get a shot of her face?

860
00:31:33.295 --> 00:31:35.400
Gosh, she finally smiles.

861
00:31:35.405 --> 00:31:38.830
You must win to get a chance to switch partners.

862
00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:39.890
- We must win? - We must win?

863
00:31:39.890 --> 00:31:41.660
Only if we win.

864
00:31:42.105 --> 00:31:45.100
It's time to select the number that will determine your fate.

865
00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:48.540
The male partners will select the cards first.

866
00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:49.610
Shall we?

867
00:31:49.615 --> 00:31:50.670
This is...

868
00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:52.570
(The total must be the highest or the lowest.)

869
00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:53.570
The female partners may select them.

870
00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:55.140
Is the highest or the lowest better?

871
00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:56.780
That depends on my number.

872
00:31:56.780 --> 00:31:58.950
- Is it the sum? - Yes.

873
00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:00.680
- Let me see it. - It's a good number.

874
00:32:00.995 --> 00:32:02.120
Isn't it good?

875
00:32:02.625 --> 00:32:03.980
I'm not sure about mine.

876
00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:05.850
The total must be the highest or the lowest.

877
00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:08.120
That's right. Ji Hyo.

878
00:32:08.195 --> 00:32:09.890
- I... - Let's show the card each.

879
00:32:10.205 --> 00:32:13.030
(They don't show it to each other.)

880
00:32:13.105 --> 00:32:14.860
- We have a possibility. - We do.

881
00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:18.970
(What will be the fate of these couples?)

882
00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:20.970
- Let's go. - Clumsy.

883
00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:22.700
- Slow cross. - Cross.

884
00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:24.740
I think this is too small.

885
00:32:24.745 --> 00:32:25.970
Your shirt color is different.

886
00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:27.510
(Kwang Soo, your shirt color is different.)

887
00:32:28.525 --> 00:32:30.510
- What? - Something went wrong.

888
00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:32.780
Did she break your heart already?

889
00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:35.650
- He lost the couple shirt. - Right.

890
00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:36.750
Stop teasing me.

891
00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:38.820
- It's because he lost it. - I didn't lose it.

892
00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:41.090
It's when the boyfriend lost the couple shirt?

893
00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:42.790
- Gosh. - That's a good metaphor.

894
00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:45.300
It's obvious with Jong Kook and Ha Ra.

895
00:32:45.305 --> 00:32:48.130
They look like professional game players.

896
00:32:48.475 --> 00:32:49.660
They got together to play games.

897
00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:50.900
They run a business.

898
00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:53.370
- Ha Ra has calmed down a lot. - Really?

899
00:32:53.370 --> 00:32:56.010
- She isn't like before. - Of course not.

900
00:32:56.015 --> 00:32:58.170
This is your first mission with Chance Card on the line.

901
00:32:58.170 --> 00:33:00.440
Let's start Talent Competition.

902
00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:01.880
(Talent Competition)

903
00:33:02.625 --> 00:33:03.750
Talent Competition?

904
00:33:04.285 --> 00:33:07.050
Among six skills that female players feel most confident about,

905
00:33:07.050 --> 00:33:10.050
we'll select three and hold competitions.

906
00:33:10.050 --> 00:33:12.220
The couple with the most stickers wins.

907
00:33:12.265 --> 00:33:15.360
If the skill is what you submitted, you win one R Sticker.

908
00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:19.160
If it's a skill submitted by someone else, you win two stickers.

909
00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:20.730
(You win two R Stickers.)

910
00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:23.360
Okay, it must be someone else's talent.

911
00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:26.100
You'll play three rounds. The team with the most stickers...

912
00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:29.010
gets a chance to switch partners and find out the number you want.

913
00:33:29.115 --> 00:33:30.180
We'll win.

914
00:33:30.185 --> 00:33:31.440
The team that comes in last...

915
00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:34.410
will reveal the number that you have.

916
00:33:34.515 --> 00:33:35.840
My goodness.

917
00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:38.180
(The team that comes in last must reveal their numbers.)

918
00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:40.120
This is difficult.

919
00:33:40.255 --> 00:33:41.780
- We have to show our numbers? - How?

920
00:33:41.995 --> 00:33:43.450
Can it be just one of us?

921
00:33:43.450 --> 00:33:44.950
(Can only one of us show the number?)

922
00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:46.620
- Both of you must show it. - Is that so?

923
00:33:47.835 --> 00:33:49.820
(Let's not do this already.)

924
00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:51.060
- Don't do this. - I won't.

925
00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:52.830
- We haven't started yet. - Gosh.

926
00:33:53.105 --> 00:33:54.530
- Shall we select one? - Yes.

927
00:33:54.735 --> 00:33:55.800
Select one.

928
00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:56.960
(Which category is it?)

929
00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:57.960
"Long jump".

930
00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:01.000
(The first talent competition is long jump.)

931
00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.410
- Are you good at long jumps? - It's for Ha Ra.

932
00:34:02.415 --> 00:34:03.540
- Oh, no. - See?

933
00:34:04.515 --> 00:34:05.640
- How about you? - Pardon?

934
00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:07.340
- Are you good at it? - I am.

935
00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:08.370
Is this your talent?

936
00:34:08.370 --> 00:34:09.880
- Yes, it is. - Really?

937
00:34:10.085 --> 00:34:14.020
(She's talented in long jumps.)

938
00:34:14.125 --> 00:34:16.820
- This is ours. - Da Hee says she's good...

939
00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:19.360
- at everything including singing. - Look at her long legs.

940
00:34:19.595 --> 00:34:21.220
- I'm good. - Her legs are long.

941
00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:23.630
That's right. She likes to jump.

942
00:34:26.935 --> 00:34:29.770
Everyone, Da Hee will start first.

943
00:34:30.045 --> 00:34:32.430
Have you done it professionally?

944
00:34:32.430 --> 00:34:34.230
We do one-foot jump often...

945
00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:36.340
- as children. - How old were you?

946
00:34:36.415 --> 00:34:38.170
- I was in kindergarten or so. - Kindergarten?

947
00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:39.840
- Yes. - We're in trouble.

948
00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:41.010
- Kindergarten? - She'll be good.

949
00:34:41.010 --> 00:34:43.880
She'll jump far because her legs are long.

950
00:34:44.285 --> 00:34:45.610
- Please start. - Shall I start now?

951
00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:46.680
- Yes. - Yes.

952
00:34:47.155 --> 00:34:48.980
- Don't step on the line. - I won't.

953
00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:51.320
- I can't do this well. - Good luck.

954
00:34:53.035 --> 00:34:54.160
(She gets nervous.)

955
00:34:54.565 --> 00:34:56.430
It won't be easy with those shoes.

956
00:34:58.305 --> 00:34:59.960
Calm down, and relax.

957
00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:05.100
(Will she show off her talent with her long legs?)

958
00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:06.170
That's good.

959
00:35:07.215 --> 00:35:08.340
(Landing)

960
00:35:14.415 --> 00:35:15.880
- She jumped really far. - Mark right here.

961
00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:17.820
- It's not enough space. - There's her footprint.

962
00:35:17.825 --> 00:35:19.650
No way. How did she jump that far?

963
00:35:27.595 --> 00:35:28.820
I jumped to here.

964
00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:30.900
- I got it. - It's right here.

965
00:35:30.905 --> 00:35:32.890
- It's 43. - It's 2m 43cm.

966
00:35:32.890 --> 00:35:34.430
Who can beat that?

967
00:35:34.905 --> 00:35:36.430
Even men can't jump that far.

968
00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:38.260
All right, Da Hee.

969
00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:40.270
- Are you satisfied? - Yes.

970
00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:41.770
(She can't believe it either.)

971
00:35:42.985 --> 00:35:45.200
- Who wants to go next? - In A will go.

972
00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:46.670
- Come on, In A. - Okay.

973
00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:48.580
Give me your bag.

974
00:35:48.885 --> 00:35:49.940
Let's go.

975
00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:52.150
- Haha. - 2, 3, 4.

976
00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:56.020
- In A, In A, in artist, baby - In A, In A, in artist, baby

977
00:35:56.525 --> 00:36:01.220
(With a chant, they show their teamwork.)

978
00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:03.130
She's good at this.

979
00:36:03.465 --> 00:36:05.290
- In A does it well. - She does.

980
00:36:05.675 --> 00:36:07.530
- Yes. - Start farther back.

981
00:36:07.605 --> 00:36:09.330
(Where are they going?)

982
00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:10.460
Okay, that's good.

983
00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:12.370
- How far are you going? - How far are you going?

984
00:36:12.845 --> 00:36:15.640
I tried that far before, but you get tired on the way.

985
00:36:16.215 --> 00:36:17.340
Let's go, In A.

986
00:36:17.515 --> 00:36:20.310
If In A jumps farther,

987
00:36:20.615 --> 00:36:22.840
she wins two stickers. Da Hee, on the other hand...

988
00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:23.880
You can do it, In A.

989
00:36:23.885 --> 00:36:26.080
This is Da Hee's talent, so she gets another turn.

990
00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:28.120
- You can do it. - I can do it.

991
00:36:28.695 --> 00:36:29.750
Let's go.

992
00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:31.890
(In A gives a try.)

993
00:36:33.195 --> 00:36:34.650
(Will In A break the record?)

994
00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:38.130
(Will In A, full of confidence, be able to break the record?)

995
00:36:43.005 --> 00:36:44.830
- It's right here. - No, no.

996
00:36:44.830 --> 00:36:45.970
- This is the spot. - All right.

997
00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:47.070
- There's a mark here. - Hold on.

998
00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:48.630
- Where is it? - Here it is. This is it.

999
00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:51.270
- This is the footprint. This is it. - My gosh.

1000
00:36:56.555 --> 00:36:58.550
- It's 2m 44cm. - It's 45.

1001
00:36:59.225 --> 00:37:00.380
- It's 44. - Okay.

1002
00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:01.910
- In A! - Yes!

1003
00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:03.120
1, 2, 3, 4.

1004
00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:05.020
(In A, In A)

1005
00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:06.820
(In A, artist, baby)

1006
00:37:07.065 --> 00:37:08.290
Great.

1007
00:37:08.435 --> 00:37:09.820
This is great. You were so cool.

1008
00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:12.730
(Her eyes are fuming.)

1009
00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:14.660
Look at Da Hee's face. She looks so intense again.

1010
00:37:15.575 --> 00:37:17.160
(Oh, no. I got caught.)

1011
00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:18.430
This means that...

1012
00:37:18.430 --> 00:37:20.270
(Haha and In A are in 1st place.)

1013
00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:21.770
Ha Ra is going to go for it now.

1014
00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:24.140
She starred on "Idol Star Athletics Championships".

1015
00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:26.210
(The time has come.)

1016
00:37:27.255 --> 00:37:32.580
(Ha Ra holds the reputation for the best runner.)

1017
00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:37.050
(Ha Ra, the athlete, has returned.)

1018
00:37:37.665 --> 00:37:40.060
- Your pants are wide. Are you okay? - Will you be all right?

1019
00:37:40.065 --> 00:37:41.290
I was wondering that too.

1020
00:37:41.295 --> 00:37:42.560
- I should pull it up. - Pull it all the way up.

1021
00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:45.590
If you jump with wide pants, it will make a flapping sound.

1022
00:37:45.590 --> 00:37:47.930
The pants are highly resistant.

1023
00:37:47.935 --> 00:37:50.440
- I don't know what will happen. - Good luck, Ha Ra.

1024
00:37:50.445 --> 00:37:51.760
That's true.

1025
00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:54.240
- She starred on the sports show. - It's been a while.

1026
00:37:54.745 --> 00:37:56.040
Don't be nervous.

1027
00:37:56.040 --> 00:38:00.210
(The third challenger, Ha Ra goes for it.)

1028
00:38:01.515 --> 00:38:07.520
(Will she be able to defend her honor of the best athlete?)

1029
00:38:10.895 --> 00:38:14.060
(What? What just happened?)

1030
00:38:19.035 --> 00:38:20.230
- Come on. - Hey.

1031
00:38:20.575 --> 00:38:22.300
That's all right.

1032
00:38:22.405 --> 00:38:24.200
- Let's try it one more time. - No, no, no.

1033
00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:25.570
- Do it one more time. - Wait, no, no.

1034
00:38:25.570 --> 00:38:27.470
- Let me try one more time. - Come on, let her try it again.

1035
00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:29.000
- Give her a chance. - Wait, please.

1036
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.700
- She should get a second chance. - I couldn't see. I couldn't.

1037
00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:32.770
I couldn't see where it was.

1038
00:38:32.770 --> 00:38:35.440
- Her nose is getting longer. - Where is it? Is this the line?

1039
00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:36.510
- Ha Ra. - Yes?

1040
00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:38.680
- You stepped here. - No, no.

1041
00:38:39.025 --> 00:38:40.310
- Do you think you can do it? - Jae Seok.

1042
00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:41.980
- Tighten your shoelaces. - Can you do it one more time?

1043
00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:44.150
- My pants are wide. - Can you do it one more time?

1044
00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:45.220
(She makes a point with her pants.)

1045
00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:46.720
- Okay. This is your last chance. - Can you do it?

1046
00:38:46.765 --> 00:38:48.820
Ha Ra, stick your pants in your socks.

1047
00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:50.890
Ha Ra, are your toes okay?

1048
00:38:54.975 --> 00:38:56.130
Ha Ra.

1049
00:38:56.445 --> 00:38:57.860
Her pants became an old lady's pants.

1050
00:38:57.860 --> 00:38:58.970
That's great.

1051
00:38:58.970 --> 00:39:00.440
Ha Ra hasn't changed a bit.

1052
00:39:00.445 --> 00:39:02.970
Ha Ra hasn't changed at all. I thought she changed.

1053
00:39:03.015 --> 00:39:04.100
She's doing her best.

1054
00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:06.010
- She's determined now. - All right. And...

1055
00:39:06.015 --> 00:39:08.270
Don't let it burden you. It's all right.

1056
00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:09.580
Start.

1057
00:39:10.155 --> 00:39:12.380
- I see greed in her face. - She moved too far back.

1058
00:39:12.895 --> 00:39:14.580
Slowly. It's all right.

1059
00:39:15.825 --> 00:39:17.020
Hey, what is this?

1060
00:39:20.365 --> 00:39:21.520
Hey, hold on.

1061
00:39:21.635 --> 00:39:22.830
She jumped a long distance.

1062
00:39:23.135 --> 00:39:25.160
(No way. That's incredible!)

1063
00:39:26.235 --> 00:39:27.370
Hey, hold on.

1064
00:39:27.375 --> 00:39:28.690
(He's shocked.)

1065
00:39:28.690 --> 00:39:30.460
- It's right there. - No, this is the spot.

1066
00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:31.730
(Could she have possibly...)

1067
00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:34.630
You did so well, but you jumped way behind the starting line.

1068
00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:36.570
(What a bummer.)

1069
00:39:38.645 --> 00:39:41.480
(She did jump far behind the line like Jong Kook said.)

1070
00:39:47.825 --> 00:39:48.950
Where did I jump?

1071
00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:50.750
- You jumped from here. - Where?

1072
00:39:51.095 --> 00:39:54.060
- Then can you add the distance? - She was scared.

1073
00:39:54.065 --> 00:39:56.060
This isn't a place for you to play tricks.

1074
00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:57.420
- No way. - My gosh.

1075
00:39:57.420 --> 00:39:58.790
That was so close, Ha Ra.

1076
00:39:59.335 --> 00:40:01.860
(Thanks to Ha Ra, In A and Haha are still in 1st place.)

1077
00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:03.330
- Who's next? - Mina will go.

1078
00:40:03.330 --> 00:40:04.600
- Mina! - All right!

1079
00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:05.870
(Mina is up next.)

1080
00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:06.970
And...

1081
00:40:07.145 --> 00:40:08.800
- Get ready. - Excuse me.

1082
00:40:09.885 --> 00:40:11.210
Da Hee, why are you looking like that?

1083
00:40:11.215 --> 00:40:13.840
- I can't watch? - I felt something creepy.

1084
00:40:15.585 --> 00:40:18.810
(Her eyes are brimming with intensity.)

1085
00:40:19.225 --> 00:40:22.790
(Da Hee, the scary-eyed woman, is watching.)

1086
00:40:22.825 --> 00:40:25.820
We're going to give it a go.

1087
00:40:26.365 --> 00:40:27.660
Where is she?

1088
00:40:29.135 --> 00:40:30.390
Where is she?

1089
00:40:30.565 --> 00:40:32.430
(Peekaboo)

1090
00:40:33.105 --> 00:40:34.530
Here she comes. She's going now.

1091
00:40:34.535 --> 00:40:36.930
(She's doing a run-up in order to accelerate her speed.)

1092
00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:38.400
Mina, run! Mina.

1093
00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:40.000
- That's great! - Mina, keep running!

1094
00:40:40.115 --> 00:40:45.470
(Screaming)

1095
00:40:46.985 --> 00:40:48.340
She jumped far behind the line too.

1096
00:40:49.555 --> 00:40:51.510
It's 2m 16cm.

1097
00:40:51.555 --> 00:40:53.020
That was close.

1098
00:40:53.095 --> 00:40:55.760
Next up is Ji Hyo!

1099
00:40:55.765 --> 00:40:58.020
I think Ji Hyo can do this well.

1100
00:40:58.295 --> 00:40:59.520
- Excuse me. - Yes?

1101
00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:01.520
Ha Ra keeps complaining that her pants were too long.

1102
00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:02.890
She's complaining.

1103
00:41:02.890 --> 00:41:04.260
Stop it.

1104
00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:06.060
- That's enough. - She's disappointed. That's all.

1105
00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:08.460
- Don't wear wide pants to shoots. - She's disappointed.

1106
00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:10.330
- Don't wear such pants for shows. - It's just a shame.

1107
00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:11.400
- She was too far behind. - I should change my pants.

1108
00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:13.400
When she did her jump, did you know that...

1109
00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:14.940
she made the flapping sound of a robe?

1110
00:41:15.175 --> 00:41:17.310
- Like a pigeon flapping. - That's right.

1111
00:41:17.915 --> 00:41:20.910
I saw several pigeons emerging from her pants.

1112
00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:23.210
- I saw pigeons emerging. - People wear them for kendo.

1113
00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:25.580
Da Hee, listen to the conversation.

1114
00:41:26.455 --> 00:41:27.980
(Focused)

1115
00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:30.620
Da Hee, listen to the conversation.

1116
00:41:30.925 --> 00:41:32.420
She keeps looking at the mat.

1117
00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:33.750
It's not going according to her plan today.

1118
00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:35.660
(Da Hee is completely focused on the match.)

1119
00:41:36.335 --> 00:41:39.430
- They must not cross the line. - It's not going as she planned.

1120
00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:41.560
When I heard this, I was so shocked.

1121
00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:42.730
- I got the chills. - What is it?

1122
00:41:42.730 --> 00:41:44.860
She was an athlete for long jumping.

1123
00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:46.040
- At that time... - When?

1124
00:41:46.145 --> 00:41:48.370
- I doubt it. Her limbs are short. - And then what?

1125
00:41:48.370 --> 00:41:49.770
- Don't let that bother you. - Hey!

1126
00:41:49.770 --> 00:41:51.340
- What? - Don't let him get to you.

1127
00:41:51.615 --> 00:41:53.010
(He manages to provoke her.)

1128
00:41:53.010 --> 00:41:54.770
Ji Hyo will try now.

1129
00:41:54.770 --> 00:41:58.510
- Bring it back - Bring it back

1130
00:41:58.510 --> 00:42:00.050
- Why are you singing it? - The title resembles her nickname.

1131
00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:01.550
- I see. - Bring it back

1132
00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:02.880
You're forcing the pun.

1133
00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:04.320
They're making all sorts of puns.

1134
00:42:05.065 --> 00:42:08.750
(She displays the look of a real athlete.)

1135
00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:10.860
Get ready. Start!

1136
00:42:11.635 --> 00:42:13.060
There you go, Ji Hyo.

1137
00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:14.300
She will turn 40 soon.

1138
00:42:15.845 --> 00:42:17.330
She will turn 40 soon.

1139
00:42:21.975 --> 00:42:26.240
(Oh, my goodness)

1140
00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:28.880
(This is unbelievable.)

1141
00:42:29.125 --> 00:42:30.350
This is the spot.

1142
00:42:30.925 --> 00:42:32.650
(Please)

1143
00:42:32.650 --> 00:42:33.850
- 36. - Gosh.

1144
00:42:33.850 --> 00:42:35.650
(Ji Hyo is placed 3rd.)

1145
00:42:35.650 --> 00:42:37.720
- Currently, In A is... - Yes?

1146
00:42:37.965 --> 00:42:41.990
- leading by 1cm. - I see.

1147
00:42:42.035 --> 00:42:43.730
Da Hee will go last now.

1148
00:42:44.035 --> 00:42:46.360
- It's her last chance. - The last chance.

1149
00:42:46.575 --> 00:42:49.160
- Long jumping was her talent. - You can do it, Da Hee.

1150
00:42:49.245 --> 00:42:50.960
Start.

1151
00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:53.130
(Will Da Hee, the talent owner, be able to reclaim 1st place?)

1152
00:42:53.130 --> 00:42:55.400
Please step on the line. Step on the line.

1153
00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:57.710
(Will Da Hee, the talent owner, be able to reclaim 1st place?)

1154
00:43:00.515 --> 00:43:01.840
(Please)

1155
00:43:04.225 --> 00:43:05.350
Great!

1156
00:43:07.055 --> 00:43:11.220
(She makes a powerful jump.)

1157
00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:14.820
(It utterly shocks everyone.)

1158
00:43:14.965 --> 00:43:16.620
- 8... 85? - My gosh.

1159
00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:22.970
(What's the result of her jump that shocked everyone?)

1160
00:43:22.975 --> 00:43:25.730
- 8... 85? It's 85! - My gosh.

1161
00:43:25.730 --> 00:43:28.200
(Impressed)

1162
00:43:29.745 --> 00:43:33.370
(Da Hee sets a new record of 2m 85m.)

1163
00:43:33.370 --> 00:43:35.880
This concludes that the first round...

1164
00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:38.380
- goes to Da Hee and Se Chan. - Awesome!

1165
00:43:38.385 --> 00:43:39.950
You were amazing, Da Hee.

1166
00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:41.250
- She's amazing. - She's incredible.

1167
00:43:41.355 --> 00:43:43.020
In A, you did well. You were so cool.

1168
00:43:43.195 --> 00:43:44.590
Let's put it here.

1169
00:43:44.595 --> 00:43:46.750
(Thanks to Da Hee's victory,)

1170
00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:49.060
(Se Chan and Da Hee acquire 1 sticker.)

1171
00:43:50.065 --> 00:43:53.190
Let me choose the next round.

1172
00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:55.160
- Let me pick. - Please.

1173
00:43:55.875 --> 00:43:57.370
- "Nostalgic Dance". Whose is it? - Nostalgic Dance.

1174
00:43:57.375 --> 00:43:59.970
(Nostalgic Dance)

1175
00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:01.040
Nostalgic Dance.

1176
00:44:01.145 --> 00:44:02.870
That's So Min's.

1177
00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:04.140
(It's So Min's talent.)

1178
00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:05.840
- That's right. - Nostalgic Dance.

1179
00:44:05.855 --> 00:44:10.250
(Her best talent is doing the nostalgic dances.)

1180
00:44:10.325 --> 00:44:11.780
Actually, So Min...

1181
00:44:12.025 --> 00:44:13.750
once trained to become an idol singer.

1182
00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:15.520
- No, that's not true. - So...

1183
00:44:15.525 --> 00:44:16.920
- Faceless Singer. - Right.

1184
00:44:16.965 --> 00:44:18.560
- Voiceless Singer. - Singer...

1185
00:44:18.565 --> 00:44:20.820
- No, it's Faceless Singer. - Why?

1186
00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:22.250
How could a singer be voiceless?

1187
00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:23.920
- It's because she can't sing. - I'm a bad singer.

1188
00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:25.120
- Hence, the name. - It's Faceless Singer.

1189
00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:26.470
- I can't sing. - All right.

1190
00:44:26.475 --> 00:44:29.190
- So Min should start us off. - That's right.

1191
00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:30.400
- Right. - So Min, it's your time.

1192
00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:31.570
- Let's move back. - Break a leg.

1193
00:44:31.575 --> 00:44:32.810
Here's the music.

1194
00:44:32.815 --> 00:44:34.270
I wish it's a song I know.

1195
00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:35.400
Break a leg, So Min.

1196
00:44:35.575 --> 00:44:36.970
- This... - Go for it.

1197
00:44:36.970 --> 00:44:39.910
I don't know the dance to this song. How could I know this?

1198
00:44:41.115 --> 00:44:44.450
("Good Time" by Cleo)

1199
00:44:45.125 --> 00:44:46.680
- I can't dance to this. - Do sexy and cute moves.

1200
00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:48.080
- It's So Min's time. - You're the best!

1201
00:44:48.595 --> 00:44:52.450
(She changes all of a sudden.)

1202
00:44:54.135 --> 00:44:57.030
(She does the key dance moves for the song.)

1203
00:44:58.235 --> 00:45:00.700
(This 33-year-old woman looks adorable and sexy.)

1204
00:45:01.335 --> 00:45:02.660
You're doing great!

1205
00:45:02.805 --> 00:45:05.100
(She's summoning Cleo. People of 1999, reply to this.)

1206
00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:06.170
You're great.

1207
00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:07.830
Let's change. Let's change the song.

1208
00:45:07.830 --> 00:45:08.930
(Her unfulfilled dream of an idol singer...)

1209
00:45:08.930 --> 00:45:10.800
- This move was so long time ago. - She's actually good.

1210
00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:12.170
- I haven't seen that dance in ages. - Exactly.

1211
00:45:13.085 --> 00:45:14.770
- She did it. - That was great.

1212
00:45:14.770 --> 00:45:16.340
- Great. - She's good at it.

1213
00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:17.510
So Min, you're excellent.

1214
00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:19.480
(The second song is...)

1215
00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:22.550
("Twist King" by Turbo from 1996.)

1216
00:45:23.125 --> 00:45:24.520
Look at her. That was sudden.

1217
00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:27.020
(She dances as soon as the song is played.)

1218
00:45:27.135 --> 00:45:29.690
My goodness. She knows the dance.

1219
00:45:29.705 --> 00:45:31.600
- She knows it. That's correct. - Is that it?

1220
00:45:31.605 --> 00:45:33.400
- She's doing it right. - So Min.

1221
00:45:33.975 --> 00:45:35.800
She's incredible indeed.

1222
00:45:36.145 --> 00:45:37.670
So Min is good at dancing.

1223
00:45:37.845 --> 00:45:39.630
I can't believe she actually knows it.

1224
00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:42.170
(She twists her feet zealously.)

1225
00:45:45.645 --> 00:45:46.840
(I'm the master of nostalgic dance!)

1226
00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:48.250
That's good. That's enough.

1227
00:45:48.255 --> 00:45:50.310
That's it. Let's stop here.

1228
00:45:50.455 --> 00:45:51.510
Well done.

1229
00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:53.350
- So Min, you did a great job. - That was excellent.

1230
00:45:53.355 --> 00:45:56.080
- You did it. - You were amazing!

1231
00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:57.620
- She's good. - Everyone.

1232
00:45:57.620 --> 00:45:59.890
So Min did such a great job with it.

1233
00:45:59.890 --> 00:46:01.850
- She was incredible. - She did well as expected.

1234
00:46:01.850 --> 00:46:04.060
She did make the dance look like it's from the old days.

1235
00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:05.690
Can they just go for it if they feel confident?

1236
00:46:05.690 --> 00:46:07.200
- Sorry? - Can they just go for it?

1237
00:46:07.235 --> 00:46:09.860
If you're confident, anyone can go for it.

1238
00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:11.560
- Oh, really? - Let's continue.

1239
00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:13.430
Please. I hope it's a song I know.

1240
00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:14.930
(What's the first song for Nostalgic Dance?)

1241
00:46:14.930 --> 00:46:16.100
("Why Do You" by Chul Yi and Mi Ae)

1242
00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:17.440
Mina went for it. That's it!

1243
00:46:18.115 --> 00:46:19.970
(As soon as the song is played,)

1244
00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:22.040
(Mina and In A go for it.)

1245
00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:23.940
- Mina knows the dance! - In A, move forward.

1246
00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:25.680
- Great. - There you go. Move forward.

1247
00:46:25.995 --> 00:46:28.980
(It's a cutthroat battle to take the center spot.)

1248
00:46:29.565 --> 00:46:30.790
You're doing great.

1249
00:46:31.125 --> 00:46:32.750
That was awesome, In A.

1250
00:46:33.135 --> 00:46:34.760
- That was nice. - That was awesome, Mina!

1251
00:46:35.195 --> 00:46:36.660
- Way to go, In A! - You're doing great, In A!

1252
00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:39.760
Mina!

1253
00:46:43.575 --> 00:46:46.670
(In A pulls out a hidden card.)

1254
00:46:46.815 --> 00:46:48.930
Mina, please go back.

1255
00:46:48.930 --> 00:46:49.940
Mina, wait.

1256
00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:51.070
Wait.

1257
00:46:51.070 --> 00:46:52.400
- Wait. - You were amazing.

1258
00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:53.770
- In A. - Mina, please wait.

1259
00:46:53.770 --> 00:46:55.380
- In A has so much energy. - In A wins.

1260
00:46:55.385 --> 00:46:57.050
Both were great though.

1261
00:46:57.225 --> 00:46:58.380
Next song.

1262
00:46:58.380 --> 00:46:59.410
(The next song is...)

1263
00:46:59.410 --> 00:47:01.180
All the songs are very old.

1264
00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:02.950
- Come in. - This is me.

1265
00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:04.920
("Mister" by Kara)

1266
00:47:05.925 --> 00:47:08.560
(The original singer joins.)

1267
00:47:09.135 --> 00:47:10.260
(Let me try too.)

1268
00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:11.560
Kara!

1269
00:47:11.635 --> 00:47:14.260
(Ha Ra versus In A versus Mina)

1270
00:47:15.235 --> 00:47:18.530
(The "Mister" dance is perfectly reproduced.)

1271
00:47:21.745 --> 00:47:25.610
(Ha Ra is owning the stage.)

1272
00:47:26.785 --> 00:47:28.640
This is me.

1273
00:47:29.115 --> 00:47:30.310
Nice.

1274
00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:32.040
Let Ha Ra win.

1275
00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:33.910
- This is me. - We have no choice.

1276
00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:35.850
- She has to win. - "This is me."

1277
00:47:35.850 --> 00:47:36.850
- "This is me." - "I'm Koo Ha Ra."

1278
00:47:36.850 --> 00:47:38.150
"This is me."

1279
00:47:38.395 --> 00:47:39.650
We have no choice.

1280
00:47:39.650 --> 00:47:42.560
- I'm surprised by Mina. - Right.

1281
00:47:42.595 --> 00:47:44.560
Her moves are so...

1282
00:47:44.565 --> 00:47:47.760
- So energetic. - What did you do?

1283
00:47:49.375 --> 00:47:50.900
That's not how you do it.

1284
00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:53.530
(Determined)

1285
00:47:53.530 --> 00:47:58.340
(The original singer gives strict instructions.)

1286
00:47:58.340 --> 00:47:59.470
Nice.

1287
00:47:59.470 --> 00:48:01.110
Let's start the game now.

1288
00:48:01.115 --> 00:48:03.380
Like I said, the champion...

1289
00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:04.880
- The champion has an advantage? - has an advantage.

1290
00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:06.810
They can join last.

1291
00:48:06.810 --> 00:48:08.610
- Join when you want. - Join at the last minute.

1292
00:48:08.610 --> 00:48:10.320
The music will keep playing.

1293
00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:12.580
Reflecting everyone's opinions...

1294
00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:13.720
- We'll... - Let's eliminate them one by one.

1295
00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:15.290
We'll eliminate them one by one.

1296
00:48:15.290 --> 00:48:17.090
If it's getting too fierce?

1297
00:48:17.635 --> 00:48:19.360
Play the music.

1298
00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:20.990
(Music starts.)

1299
00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:23.300
Do you know this one? It's Lee Jung Hyun.

1300
00:48:23.445 --> 00:48:25.970
- This is mine. - Too bad for Mina.

1301
00:48:26.715 --> 00:48:31.610
("Wa" by Lee Jung Hyun)

1302
00:48:31.745 --> 00:48:34.010
- Just dance as you want. - Here we go.

1303
00:48:34.215 --> 00:48:36.380
She's so good.

1304
00:48:36.855 --> 00:48:38.910
Let's go, Mina!

1305
00:48:38.910 --> 00:48:40.450
(The 1999-born reinterprets "Wa".)

1306
00:48:40.450 --> 00:48:42.310
- You don't know the dance? - It suits the song.

1307
00:48:42.310 --> 00:48:44.220
- She doesn't know the song? - Let's go, Mina!

1308
00:48:44.225 --> 00:48:45.550
Let's do this!

1309
00:48:45.595 --> 00:48:47.720
In A comes onto the stage.

1310
00:48:47.965 --> 00:48:49.290
In A.

1311
00:48:49.290 --> 00:48:50.390
(Pushing)

1312
00:48:51.235 --> 00:48:53.530
Let's go.

1313
00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:55.530
(After pushing Mina away, In A starts to techno dance.)

1314
00:48:55.530 --> 00:48:57.330
Mina is eliminated.

1315
00:48:57.575 --> 00:48:59.160
(She's getting into the zone.)

1316
00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:01.030
- That's what we're talking about. - She's so good.

1317
00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:02.170
She's so passionate.

1318
00:49:02.170 --> 00:49:03.810
- Way to go! - She's so enthusiastic.

1319
00:49:04.445 --> 00:49:06.000
Nice.

1320
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.310
That's Lee Jung Hyun.

1321
00:49:07.310 --> 00:49:10.010
Go, Da Hee! Nice!

1322
00:49:10.285 --> 00:49:12.180
- Great! - That's Lee Jung Hyun.

1323
00:49:12.955 --> 00:49:15.310
- That's Lee Jung Hyun. - Amazing.

1324
00:49:15.310 --> 00:49:16.950
Way to go!

1325
00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:18.120
(Powerful)

1326
00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:19.420
(She owns the stage with her appearance and dance.)

1327
00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:20.890
That's exactly like Lee Jung Hyun!

1328
00:49:21.595 --> 00:49:22.920
We can't beat that!

1329
00:49:23.165 --> 00:49:25.690
We can't do this.

1330
00:49:26.705 --> 00:49:30.400
(She's having her moment.)

1331
00:49:31.005 --> 00:49:33.370
- Gosh. - Da Hee did it!

1332
00:49:33.370 --> 00:49:37.110
- Da Hee! - It's over.

1333
00:49:37.415 --> 00:49:39.000
- Da Hee wins. - No one can beat that.

1334
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:40.310
Da Hee wins.

1335
00:49:40.310 --> 00:49:41.770
- No one can beat that. - Da Hee wins.

1336
00:49:41.770 --> 00:49:43.340
- Da Hee wins. - No one can beat that.

1337
00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:45.210
Let her win.

1338
00:49:45.210 --> 00:49:47.050
- You win. - You win.

1339
00:49:47.055 --> 00:49:49.080
I thought Lee Jung Hyun really came.

1340
00:49:49.865 --> 00:49:51.190
Look at this.

1341
00:49:51.395 --> 00:49:54.420
She couldn't even try after preparing this.

1342
00:49:54.635 --> 00:49:57.020
Because of Da Hee, she couldn't even try.

1343
00:49:57.020 --> 00:49:59.120
Too bad. She should have tried.

1344
00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:00.130
It's unbelievable.

1345
00:50:00.130 --> 00:50:01.860
Da Hee is...

1346
00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:03.700
- threatening the others. - She is.

1347
00:50:03.745 --> 00:50:06.700
Da Hee, how did you wait until today?

1348
00:50:07.045 --> 00:50:09.500
- Da Hee and Ha Ra... - She's unrivaled.

1349
00:50:09.615 --> 00:50:10.810
Next song.

1350
00:50:11.015 --> 00:50:13.310
(The next song is...)

1351
00:50:13.310 --> 00:50:16.280
It's "Coming-of-Age Ceremony".

1352
00:50:17.885 --> 00:50:21.520
(Da Hee and Ha Ra are getting ready.)

1353
00:50:22.025 --> 00:50:23.390
This is...

1354
00:50:24.095 --> 00:50:26.320
(Crowded)

1355
00:50:26.795 --> 00:50:28.220
Something is weird.

1356
00:50:28.795 --> 00:50:29.920
(So Min's moves are accurate.)

1357
00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:31.130
Look at So Min.

1358
00:50:33.175 --> 00:50:35.490
(Stiff)

1359
00:50:35.490 --> 00:50:37.960
Something is weird.

1360
00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:40.000
- Something is weird. - Da Hee, you're eliminated.

1361
00:50:41.315 --> 00:50:44.470
(Someone weirder lies down.)

1362
00:50:45.045 --> 00:50:46.940
(I feel tired today.)

1363
00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:48.410
What is she doing?

1364
00:50:49.725 --> 00:50:51.350
Look at So Min.

1365
00:50:51.455 --> 00:50:53.780
- Way to go! - It's a mess.

1366
00:50:53.780 --> 00:50:56.250
- What is this? - What is she doing?

1367
00:50:56.250 --> 00:50:58.520
That's hilarious.

1368
00:50:58.925 --> 00:51:00.860
- Da Hee. - Nice!

1369
00:51:01.695 --> 00:51:03.820
- Da Hee. - That's amazing.

1370
00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:05.060
You're good.

1371
00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:06.600
(Climax)

1372
00:51:08.035 --> 00:51:09.490
(I'm...)

1373
00:51:09.490 --> 00:51:10.700
(the dancing queen...)

1374
00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:12.800
(here.)

1375
00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:15.040
Okay. It's over.

1376
00:51:15.045 --> 00:51:17.900
- Good job, Ha Ra. - You did great.

1377
00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:20.110
Good job, So Min.

1378
00:51:20.185 --> 00:51:22.070
- Is it okay to roll on the floor? - That was hilarious.

1379
00:51:22.070 --> 00:51:23.910
- These three are not okay. - Good job.

1380
00:51:24.555 --> 00:51:27.050
Is it okay to roll on the floor?

1381
00:51:27.055 --> 00:51:28.950
I thought Ha Ra collapsed.

1382
00:51:29.095 --> 00:51:31.720
I thought it was the red carpet.

1383
00:51:31.895 --> 00:51:33.250
I thought...

1384
00:51:33.250 --> 00:51:36.290
it was the red carpet. I was so surprised.

1385
00:51:36.290 --> 00:51:37.720
Da Hee, you're doing great,

1386
00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:39.830
but I don't want to see that facial expression.

1387
00:51:40.105 --> 00:51:41.560
"It's my turn."

1388
00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:44.500
(Music is the only drug allowed by the law.)

1389
00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:46.600
- It was so annoying. - She can't hide it.

1390
00:51:46.975 --> 00:51:48.530
Her emotions show on her face.

1391
00:51:48.530 --> 00:51:50.170
She can't hide anything.

1392
00:51:50.170 --> 00:51:51.710
This is the final round.

1393
00:51:52.145 --> 00:51:54.980
Let's see who wins.

1394
00:51:55.185 --> 00:51:56.840
In A is so cool.

1395
00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:59.110
In A picked a song herself.

1396
00:51:59.110 --> 00:52:00.550
She learned how to dance.

1397
00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:02.110
- In A is... - She's so good.

1398
00:52:02.110 --> 00:52:03.550
She's like a clubber.

1399
00:52:03.550 --> 00:52:05.890
- Play the music. - Go, In A!

1400
00:52:06.995 --> 00:52:09.490
("Bang Bang Bang" by BIGBANG)

1401
00:52:10.535 --> 00:52:13.530
(From head to toe,)

1402
00:52:13.530 --> 00:52:15.930
(she's so cool.)

1403
00:52:19.645 --> 00:52:21.940
This is amazing.

1404
00:52:22.515 --> 00:52:23.940
Let's go!

1405
00:52:27.015 --> 00:52:29.110
(Powerful)

1406
00:52:29.115 --> 00:52:30.810
- Let's do this. - Let's do this.

1407
00:52:30.810 --> 00:52:32.850
(She's full of hiphop spirit.)

1408
00:52:34.295 --> 00:52:35.410
(She looks professional.)

1409
00:52:35.410 --> 00:52:37.480
My face is so red.

1410
00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:38.890
(She throws her cap.)

1411
00:52:39.065 --> 00:52:40.520
She's doing something.

1412
00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:42.860
- She's doing something. - She's doing something.

1413
00:52:44.465 --> 00:52:45.830
What was that?

1414
00:52:49.075 --> 00:52:50.160
(Freeze)

1415
00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:51.570
- Amazing. - What was that?

1416
00:52:51.575 --> 00:52:52.770
Oh, my.

1417
00:52:53.215 --> 00:52:54.530
What was that?

1418
00:52:54.530 --> 00:52:56.040
Was that really necessary?

1419
00:52:57.015 --> 00:53:00.510
Was that necessary?

1420
00:53:02.385 --> 00:53:04.410
(Respect)

1421
00:53:04.625 --> 00:53:07.450
Nothing can beat a freeze.

1422
00:53:07.450 --> 00:53:09.250
Can you show us one more time?

1423
00:53:09.250 --> 00:53:11.180
I can't believe it.

1424
00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:15.620
- She's so strong. - 1, 2, 3, 4.

1425
00:53:18.405 --> 00:53:20.060
(Impressed)

1426
00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:21.360
I'm tired.

1427
00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:22.660
Can you do it?

1428
00:53:23.705 --> 00:53:25.470
- Ha Ra. - She wants to try.

1429
00:53:26.045 --> 00:53:27.630
How do you do it?

1430
00:53:27.630 --> 00:53:31.040
You don't know? Do you want to learn it now?

1431
00:53:31.515 --> 00:53:36.480
- 1, 2, 3... - 1, 2, 3...

1432
00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:38.180
- Put your arms down. - Okay.

1433
00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:40.350
Go down and put your forehead on the floor.

1434
00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:41.780
Get your feet off the floor.

1435
00:53:41.855 --> 00:53:43.320
(Ha Ra falls.)

1436
00:53:45.995 --> 00:53:47.390
(Falling)

1437
00:53:47.795 --> 00:53:49.930
Ha Ra, go back.

1438
00:53:50.605 --> 00:53:52.860
Hold on. Da Hee came to me...

1439
00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:55.090
and asked...

1440
00:53:55.090 --> 00:53:56.870
if "1, 2, 3" was really necessary.

1441
00:53:56.875 --> 00:53:58.530
- Is "1, 2, 3" necessary? - Da Hee, come here.

1442
00:53:58.530 --> 00:53:59.800
She was wondering.

1443
00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:01.130
- Da Hee, try. - No.

1444
00:54:01.130 --> 00:54:03.540
- She doesn't think it's necessary. - No.

1445
00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:04.940
- She thinks she can do it. - Try it.

1446
00:54:04.940 --> 00:54:06.770
- Try. - How are you going to do it?

1447
00:54:06.770 --> 00:54:08.440
You don't need the first part.

1448
00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:11.280
You just have to support yourself with your arms.

1449
00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:12.440
- Right? - Yes.

1450
00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:13.750
- She might be able to do it. - Like this...

1451
00:54:13.995 --> 00:54:18.620
Will it really be okay if this airs?

1452
00:54:20.395 --> 00:54:21.990
Like this...

1453
00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:25.390
(She rolls on the floor.)

1454
00:54:26.135 --> 00:54:27.690
- Da Hee. - What's with you?

1455
00:54:27.690 --> 00:54:29.030
What did she do?

1456
00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:30.970
- Mina, can you do it? - Try it.

1457
00:54:30.975 --> 00:54:32.500
You can do it.

1458
00:54:32.575 --> 00:54:34.400
Put your elbow here.

1459
00:54:34.715 --> 00:54:36.470
- Why are they learning it? - Here.

1460
00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:38.970
- In A prepared so much. - Let's go.

1461
00:54:38.970 --> 00:54:40.510
- Put your forehead on the floor. - It must be hard.

1462
00:54:40.510 --> 00:54:41.880
- Let's do this. - You need strength.

1463
00:54:42.055 --> 00:54:43.580
(Screaming)

1464
00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:44.850
What was that sound?

1465
00:54:45.325 --> 00:54:48.150
(She sounds like a pterosaur.)

1466
00:54:48.995 --> 00:54:50.780
- What was that sound? - It must be hard.

1467
00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:52.480
- What was that? - What did you do?

1468
00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:54.160
This is Jurassic Park.

1469
00:54:54.295 --> 00:54:55.790
It was a pterosaur.

1470
00:54:55.790 --> 00:54:57.520
- Did you make that sound? - Did you?

1471
00:54:57.520 --> 00:54:59.060
What was that scream?

1472
00:54:59.060 --> 00:55:00.690
Who made that sound?

1473
00:55:00.690 --> 00:55:02.130
Mina, what was it?

1474
00:55:02.435 --> 00:55:04.760
It's such a mess.

1475
00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:06.030
Put your hands down.

1476
00:55:07.115 --> 00:55:08.770
- And your leg. - Okay.

1477
00:55:08.770 --> 00:55:10.240
Put your forehead down.

1478
00:55:10.545 --> 00:55:11.740
Lift your legs.

1479
00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:13.310
- Lift your legs. - Lift your legs.

1480
00:55:13.310 --> 00:55:15.580
(Thump)

1481
00:55:16.525 --> 00:55:19.610
What was that? Did someone fart?

1482
00:55:20.795 --> 00:55:22.080
What was that sound?

1483
00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:24.250
(She can't control her body.)

1484
00:55:24.595 --> 00:55:26.760
- She's annoyed. - She'll be 40 soon.

1485
00:55:27.065 --> 00:55:29.720
She'll be 40 soon.

1486
00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:31.090
- How do you do it? - In A is amazing.

1487
00:55:31.090 --> 00:55:32.620
Did In A win?

1488
00:55:32.620 --> 00:55:34.760
- She wins, right? - She's amazing.

1489
00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:35.890
This is the final round.

1490
00:55:35.890 --> 00:55:37.500
- So Min has... - Right.

1491
00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:39.460
- Please play an old song. - another chance.

1492
00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:41.000
- This is the last song. - Go.

1493
00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.470
(The last song is "I'm Your Girl" by S.E.S.)

1494
00:55:43.470 --> 00:55:45.300
- So Min. - S.E.S.

1495
00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:46.940
- I like S.E.S. - Let's go!

1496
00:55:48.415 --> 00:55:53.950
("I'm Your Girl" by S.E.S)

1497
00:55:55.595 --> 00:55:58.350
(As soon as the song starts,)

1498
00:55:58.350 --> 00:56:01.320
(So Min becomes immersed.)

1499
00:56:03.095 --> 00:56:04.790
(Mina joins.)

1500
00:56:04.790 --> 00:56:06.360
Mina even knows this dance.

1501
00:56:06.405 --> 00:56:08.760
Mina.

1502
00:56:10.775 --> 00:56:12.160
She knows every dance.

1503
00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:14.900
(The song was released 2 years before she was born.)

1504
00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:16.270
S.E.S!

1505
00:56:17.345 --> 00:56:19.700
Here comes Da Hee!

1506
00:56:19.700 --> 00:56:22.810
(The real one is here.)

1507
00:56:24.655 --> 00:56:27.080
(Da Hee looks exactly like Bada.)

1508
00:56:27.895 --> 00:56:29.080
Ji Hyo.

1509
00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:32.050
(The 2018 version of S.E.S)

1510
00:56:32.050 --> 00:56:34.090
- No one can stop Da Hee. - No.

1511
00:56:34.135 --> 00:56:35.220
Seriously.

1512
00:56:35.220 --> 00:56:36.820
(She's the best entertainer today.)

1513
00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:38.760
She is amazing.

1514
00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:40.800
They're S.E.S.

1515
00:56:41.335 --> 00:56:42.860
That's good enough.

1516
00:56:42.860 --> 00:56:43.930
(The fierce dance battle ends.)

1517
00:56:44.705 --> 00:56:46.840
Where did she get the hair tie?

1518
00:56:46.875 --> 00:56:48.130
Is she some crook?

1519
00:56:48.130 --> 00:56:50.410
- Take away her hair tie. - She's a crook.

1520
00:56:50.415 --> 00:56:52.540
Did she invite a makeup team?

1521
00:56:52.540 --> 00:56:54.740
- Let me say something. - Wait.

1522
00:56:54.740 --> 00:56:58.080
Why did this team get a private dressing room?

1523
00:56:58.080 --> 00:56:59.880
- That's not it. - Everyone else stays here,

1524
00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:01.350
but you enter from back there.

1525
00:57:01.755 --> 00:57:05.450
(She's prepared to act like Lee Jung Hyun.)

1526
00:57:05.450 --> 00:57:08.290
(She even looks like Ba Da.)

1527
00:57:08.290 --> 00:57:10.060
(Where does she get changed?)

1528
00:57:10.265 --> 00:57:12.060
- She needs time to do makeup. - What?

1529
00:57:12.405 --> 00:57:14.930
- She needs to change. - My goodness.

1530
00:57:14.930 --> 00:57:16.260
- Everyone. - She's like a crook.

1531
00:57:16.260 --> 00:57:17.400
We have a winner.

1532
00:57:17.405 --> 00:57:18.560
They're Da Hee and Se Chan.

1533
00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:21.000
(Based on the votes, Se Chan and Da Hee win.)

1534
00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:22.570
(They win twice consecutively.)

1535
00:57:22.570 --> 00:57:23.670
This is her day.

1536
00:57:24.045 --> 00:57:25.370
I'm jealous.

1537
00:57:25.370 --> 00:57:26.780
She's like a crook.

1538
00:57:26.785 --> 00:57:30.140
Everyone, it's the first time since the segment started.

1539
00:57:30.140 --> 00:57:31.510
It's over since we have a winner.

1540
00:57:31.510 --> 00:57:32.510
Okay.

1541
00:57:32.510 --> 00:57:34.250
(They win with 3 R Stickers.)

1542
00:57:34.250 --> 00:57:36.920
(Se Chan and Da Hee win a Chance Card.)

1543
00:57:38.125 --> 00:57:42.920
As a result, Seok Jin and So Min come in last.

1544
00:57:42.935 --> 00:57:45.620
Please reveal your numbers.

1545
00:57:45.620 --> 00:57:47.890
- Do we both reveal it? - Yes, both of you.

1546
00:57:47.890 --> 00:57:49.730
(Both must show their numbers.)

1547
00:57:49.730 --> 00:57:51.400
People will want my number once they find out.

1548
00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:52.930
What is Seok Jin's number?

1549
00:57:52.930 --> 00:57:55.270
(Seok Jin's number is 3.)

1550
00:57:55.270 --> 00:57:56.670
- Three. - That's tricky.

1551
00:57:56.670 --> 00:57:58.400
- It's a tricky number. - Three.

1552
00:57:58.400 --> 00:58:00.270
(3 is a tricky number.)

1553
00:58:00.270 --> 00:58:01.270
It's a tricky number.

1554
00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:02.340
So Min?

1555
00:58:02.615 --> 00:58:03.750
- It's 2. - 2.

1556
00:58:04.155 --> 00:58:05.510
That's a good number.

1557
00:58:06.455 --> 00:58:08.550
- Yes, it is. - Okay.

1558
00:58:08.550 --> 00:58:11.290
The highest total as of now is...

1559
00:58:11.665 --> 00:58:12.720
12.

1560
00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:16.320
(The highest total is 12.)

1561
00:58:16.865 --> 00:58:20.130
Does that mean a couple has 6 and 6?

1562
00:58:20.130 --> 00:58:22.930
The lowest total is...

1563
00:58:24.634 --> 00:58:27.370
The highest total as of now is...

1564
00:58:27.737 --> 00:58:28.805
12.

1565
00:58:28.805 --> 00:58:32.408
(The highest total is 12.)

1566
00:58:32.942 --> 00:58:36.212
Does that mean a couple has 6 and 6?

1567
00:58:36.212 --> 00:58:39.015
The lowest total is...

1568
00:58:39.783 --> 00:58:42.485
- 5. - That was us.

1569
00:58:42.485 --> 00:58:44.788
(Seok Jin and So Min's total is 5.)

1570
00:58:44.788 --> 00:58:46.523
- It was us. - Why did you whistle?

1571
00:58:46.523 --> 00:58:47.891
We should break that couple.

1572
00:58:48.291 --> 00:58:49.592
The winning couple must break them.

1573
00:58:49.592 --> 00:58:52.929
For Se Chan and Da Hee who won,

1574
00:58:52.929 --> 00:58:56.366
only one of you gets a Chance Card. Play rock-paper-scissors.

1575
00:58:56.699 --> 00:58:57.834
I will win.

1576
00:58:58.268 --> 00:59:00.503
Rock-paper-scissors.

1577
00:59:00.703 --> 00:59:02.372
- Okay. - Se Chan.

1578
00:59:02.372 --> 00:59:03.973
- Step to the front. - Okay.

1579
00:59:03.973 --> 00:59:06.476
(He gets a chance to switch partners.)

1580
00:59:06.476 --> 00:59:08.578
Which number would you like to know?

1581
00:59:09.312 --> 00:59:10.513
Female player who has number one.

1582
00:59:11.014 --> 00:59:12.916
- Female player? - Yes.

1583
00:59:12.916 --> 00:59:14.417
Female player that has number one...

1584
00:59:14.884 --> 00:59:16.085
is Mina.

1585
00:59:16.085 --> 00:59:17.220
(It's Mina.)

1586
00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:18.621
(In that case...)

1587
00:59:18.621 --> 00:59:19.756
It's Mina.

1588
00:59:21.424 --> 00:59:22.559
I have no idea.

1589
00:59:22.559 --> 00:59:23.626
- Tell us. - No.

1590
00:59:24.194 --> 00:59:26.830
Gosh, it's too general.

1591
00:59:26.896 --> 00:59:30.433
Se Chan, would you like to switch partners?

1592
00:59:30.433 --> 00:59:31.835
(What will Se Chan choose?)

1593
00:59:31.835 --> 00:59:32.902
I will be...

1594
00:59:33.570 --> 00:59:34.938
partners with Mina.

1595
00:59:34.938 --> 00:59:37.640
(He exchanges with Kwang Soo.)

1596
00:59:38.474 --> 00:59:39.776
- I'm sorry. - Who?

1597
00:59:39.776 --> 00:59:40.910
It was fun.

1598
00:59:41.711 --> 00:59:42.846
- Gosh. - Mina.

1599
00:59:42.979 --> 00:59:44.914
- Change partners. - Hello.

1600
00:59:45.048 --> 00:59:46.549
- It's nice to meet you. - Who has 6 and 6?

1601
00:59:46.549 --> 00:59:48.651
- She looks happier than before. - We were perfect.

1602
00:59:48.651 --> 00:59:50.486
Da Hee looks so happy now.

1603
00:59:50.486 --> 00:59:51.654
They look good together as well.

1604
00:59:51.654 --> 00:59:53.223
They're the perfect height for each other.

1605
00:59:53.223 --> 00:59:55.024
- They look the best together. - Really?

1606
00:59:55.024 --> 00:59:56.292
- I agree. - Yes.

1607
00:59:56.960 --> 00:59:58.661
You two look good as well.

1608
00:59:58.795 --> 01:00:01.130
- He looks like her manager. - That's right.

1609
01:00:01.297 --> 01:00:03.533
- He looks like a good deacon. - I'm always ready to go.

1610
01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.134
Shall we move on?

1611
01:00:05.134 --> 01:00:06.836
(What will be the result of the switch?)

1612
01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:10.740
Meal Card and Chance Card are on the line for the next mission.

1613
01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:11.975
Even Meal Cards?

1614
01:00:11.975 --> 01:00:14.344
It's called Our Lunch Link.

1615
01:00:14.344 --> 01:00:16.112
(Our Lunch Link)

1616
01:00:16.512 --> 01:00:19.883
Partners will be linked by the wrists and search for...

1617
01:00:19.883 --> 01:00:22.752
the members' name stickers that are hidden in the hotel.

1618
01:00:23.086 --> 01:00:27.223
Attach the stickers on the Top and Bottom roulettes.

1619
01:00:27.323 --> 01:00:29.259
The selected couple from the Top roulette wins Korean beef steak...

1620
01:00:29.259 --> 01:00:31.961
- and a Chance Card. - Korean beef steak?

1621
01:00:31.961 --> 01:00:34.664
(Winner from the Top roulette gets Korean beef steak and Chance Card.)

1622
01:00:34.664 --> 01:00:37.400
The rest of the couples will get sandwiches.

1623
01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:39.002
The selected couple from the Bottom roulette...

1624
01:00:39.002 --> 01:00:42.338
gets rice with dried laver and must reveal their numbers.

1625
01:00:42.672 --> 01:00:46.042
All couples will start after linking their wrists.

1626
01:00:46.042 --> 01:00:47.110
Let's get it. Let's hurry.

1627
01:00:47.110 --> 01:00:48.144
- Get it, get it. - Let's go.

1628
01:00:48.144 --> 01:00:49.145
Let's go.

1629
01:00:49.145 --> 01:00:51.047
- This is great. - It's a nice place.

1630
01:00:51.047 --> 01:00:52.181
There's a lot here.

1631
01:00:52.248 --> 01:00:53.716
We must win no matter what.

1632
01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:56.352
- Jae Seok, we can't separate. - What?

1633
01:00:56.686 --> 01:00:59.789
Do you have number six?

1634
01:01:01.090 --> 01:01:04.661
(Jae Seok had number 6.)

1635
01:01:05.495 --> 01:01:07.230
(The highest total...)

1636
01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:10.667
(is 12. That means...)

1637
01:01:10.667 --> 01:01:14.604
(That means Ji Hyo's number is 6 as well.)

1638
01:01:14.604 --> 01:01:16.439
- Yes, I have number six. - That's amazing.

1639
01:01:16.439 --> 01:01:18.474
How can we both have six?

1640
01:01:18.474 --> 01:01:19.475
(They must keep it a secret.)

1641
01:01:19.475 --> 01:01:20.944
Be quiet so that no one finds out.

1642
01:01:22.045 --> 01:01:24.781
How can we search in such a big place?

1643
01:01:25.081 --> 01:01:26.249
- Da Hee. - Yes?

1644
01:01:26.449 --> 01:01:28.751
Which number does Se Chan have?

1645
01:01:29.686 --> 01:01:31.220
- Se Chan's number? - Yes.

1646
01:01:31.454 --> 01:01:33.623
- Am I allowed to tell you? - Of course.

1647
01:01:34.958 --> 01:01:37.260
You won't be partners with Se Chan again.

1648
01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:38.561
Is your number high or low?

1649
01:01:38.594 --> 01:01:39.729
- Mine? - Yes.

1650
01:01:40.563 --> 01:01:43.800
Shouldn't we know our place since we're a team?

1651
01:01:44.867 --> 01:01:46.536
The writer told me that...

1652
01:01:46.769 --> 01:01:49.906
- I can believe everyone but you. - What?

1653
01:01:50.073 --> 01:01:51.908
What are you talking about?

1654
01:01:53.343 --> 01:01:54.744
Da Hee, you must tell each other...

1655
01:01:54.744 --> 01:01:56.679
so that we know our place.

1656
01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:59.449
Tell me if your number is high or low.

1657
01:01:59.449 --> 01:02:00.950
- It's a high number. - Is it high?

1658
01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:02.852
Yes, what's your number?

1659
01:02:03.486 --> 01:02:04.620
- Mine? - Yes.

1660
01:02:04.687 --> 01:02:06.122
My number is six.

1661
01:02:06.356 --> 01:02:07.490
- Is it six? - Yes.

1662
01:02:07.790 --> 01:02:08.958
- Really? - Yes.

1663
01:02:09.492 --> 01:02:10.793
- You have six? - Yes.

1664
01:02:12.495 --> 01:02:17.700
(However, they're the couple with 6's.)

1665
01:02:18.801 --> 01:02:20.136
(She's a trickster like Kwang Soo.)

1666
01:02:20.136 --> 01:02:21.270
What's your number?

1667
01:02:22.905 --> 01:02:24.440
- What is it? - Mine is two.

1668
01:02:25.308 --> 01:02:26.509
Is your number six?

1669
01:02:26.676 --> 01:02:28.678
Yes, what's your number again?

1670
01:02:29.512 --> 01:02:32.315
- To be honest... - Be honest with me.

1671
01:02:32.315 --> 01:02:34.350
- You shouldn't lie about it. - Let's show each other.

1672
01:02:34.684 --> 01:02:36.252
(They decide to show the number.)

1673
01:02:36.252 --> 01:02:37.653
Show me. One.

1674
01:02:37.653 --> 01:02:39.389
- In 3, 2, 1. - In 3, 2, 1.

1675
01:02:40.556 --> 01:02:42.592
- You didn't take it out. - Come on.

1676
01:02:42.592 --> 01:02:44.594
- Don't do it. - Is it six?

1677
01:02:44.894 --> 01:02:46.763
Is it six? I'll show you mine.

1678
01:02:46.763 --> 01:02:48.398
- In three. - Put it down here.

1679
01:02:48.598 --> 01:02:50.500
- Put it down. - Is this necessary?

1680
01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:52.435
- Let it go. - Why won't you believe me?

1681
01:02:52.435 --> 01:02:53.636
Throw it down.

1682
01:02:53.636 --> 01:02:55.138
- In 3, 2, 1. - In 3, 2, 1.

1683
01:02:55.138 --> 01:02:56.706
(They hesitate.)

1684
01:02:56.706 --> 01:02:58.241
(They're perfect for each other.)

1685
01:02:58.241 --> 01:03:00.877
You're a cheater, aren't you?

1686
01:03:00.877 --> 01:03:03.079
- No. In 3, 2, 1. - In 3, 2, 1.

1687
01:03:03.246 --> 01:03:05.148
(It's a big mess.)

1688
01:03:05.148 --> 01:03:06.149
- What? - Okay.

1689
01:03:06.149 --> 01:03:08.017
- I got it. Give me one chance. - You're so...

1690
01:03:08.017 --> 01:03:10.753
- You're so terrible. - Okay.

1691
01:03:10.753 --> 01:03:13.022
- You're terrible. - I won't look. I put it down.

1692
01:03:13.523 --> 01:03:14.590
Give it back.

1693
01:03:14.590 --> 01:03:16.759
(Was Kwang Soo telling the truth?)

1694
01:03:18.261 --> 01:03:20.396
(It's 5.)

1695
01:03:21.431 --> 01:03:24.434
(She's angry that he lied to her.)

1696
01:03:25.701 --> 01:03:28.171
You said that yours was six.

1697
01:03:29.505 --> 01:03:31.107
- It's not. - I thought it was.

1698
01:03:31.107 --> 01:03:32.875
I thought it was six.

1699
01:03:33.643 --> 01:03:34.844
Aren't we on the same team?

1700
01:03:34.911 --> 01:03:36.612
Yes, we are.

1701
01:03:36.979 --> 01:03:40.183
You told me that yours was two. What I said was better.

1702
01:03:40.183 --> 01:03:42.418
The difference is only one.

1703
01:03:42.819 --> 01:03:45.254
Why does the difference matter?

1704
01:03:46.055 --> 01:03:47.957
- I bet there's something here. - I agree.

1705
01:03:49.025 --> 01:03:51.160
(They look around.)

1706
01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:53.062
- Where? - There it is.

1707
01:03:53.429 --> 01:03:55.264
(They're the first to find a name sticker.)

1708
01:03:55.264 --> 01:03:57.233
- There it is. - Okay.

1709
01:03:58.634 --> 01:04:00.603
- Let's go and stick it. - Let's go. What is it?

1710
01:04:00.603 --> 01:04:02.305
- It's Jae Seok and Ji Hyo. - There's a lot.

1711
01:04:02.305 --> 01:04:03.940
(They find Jae Seok and Ji Hyo's names.)

1712
01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:05.575
- Let's go to Room 1509. - Let's stick them there.

1713
01:04:05.575 --> 01:04:06.642
Then look for more.

1714
01:04:07.110 --> 01:04:09.145
Where is it? Look, Seok Jin.

1715
01:04:09.145 --> 01:04:10.213
- Where? - Seok Jin.

1716
01:04:10.246 --> 01:04:11.781
Where? This is amazing.

1717
01:04:11.781 --> 01:04:13.182
We found more. It's us.

1718
01:04:13.182 --> 01:04:14.650
(They find their own names.)

1719
01:04:14.650 --> 01:04:18.054
(Stick them on the Top roulette and win Korean beef steak.)

1720
01:04:18.754 --> 01:04:20.089
(Other teams find name stickers.)

1721
01:04:20.089 --> 01:04:21.791
- We found them. - This is great.

1722
01:04:21.791 --> 01:04:23.793
Let's split them just in case.

1723
01:04:23.793 --> 01:04:24.894
Okay.

1724
01:04:25.561 --> 01:04:27.396
- No one has been here. - Okay.

1725
01:04:27.396 --> 01:04:28.397
(They're the first.)

1726
01:04:28.397 --> 01:04:31.567
Okay, Jae Seok and Ji Hyo.

1727
01:04:31.567 --> 01:04:32.735
Let's stick them right away.

1728
01:04:34.303 --> 01:04:35.805
(Let's win steak and the Chance Card.)

1729
01:04:35.805 --> 01:04:37.540
- Okay. - We're safe now.

1730
01:04:37.607 --> 01:04:38.841
Let's find other people's.

1731
01:04:39.308 --> 01:04:41.144
- We're on the Bottom roulette. - They're on the Top roulette.

1732
01:04:41.144 --> 01:04:42.678
Gosh, we got unlucky.

1733
01:04:42.879 --> 01:04:44.280
It's over.

1734
01:04:44.313 --> 01:04:45.481
Is it over?

1735
01:04:47.016 --> 01:04:50.920
We'll determine the winner and loser by turning the roulettes.

1736
01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:54.056
Let's have Mina turn the Top roulette.

1737
01:04:54.223 --> 01:04:55.625
1, 2, 3.

1738
01:04:55.992 --> 01:04:57.593
That's great, Mina. Let's go.

1739
01:04:57.593 --> 01:04:59.929
- Mina. - Please, Mina.

1740
01:04:59.929 --> 01:05:01.297
We have a high chance of winning.

1741
01:05:01.297 --> 01:05:02.365
(They have 3 names on the Top roulette.)

1742
01:05:04.233 --> 01:05:05.935
- No. - Don't do that.

1743
01:05:05.935 --> 01:05:09.005
- Okay. - Keep going.

1744
01:05:09.005 --> 01:05:10.806
- Yes! - We won!

1745
01:05:10.806 --> 01:05:13.376
(Jong Kook and Ha Ra win.)

1746
01:05:13.376 --> 01:05:14.510
We got it.

1747
01:05:15.044 --> 01:05:17.180
It's us, Ha Ra.

1748
01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:18.981
- We had three. - We got it.

1749
01:05:19.582 --> 01:05:21.617
We have four.

1750
01:05:21.617 --> 01:05:23.419
We have too many.

1751
01:05:23.419 --> 01:05:25.087
(Jae Seok and Kwang Soo's teams have 4 each.)

1752
01:05:25.087 --> 01:05:27.423
Do you know how many weeks I've been eating that?

1753
01:05:27.423 --> 01:05:28.491
Drink water.

1754
01:05:28.491 --> 01:05:30.159
Who would like to spin the roulette?

1755
01:05:30.393 --> 01:05:32.628
Da Hee can do it.

1756
01:05:32.628 --> 01:05:34.463
- Do you trust me, Kwang Soo? - Of course.

1757
01:05:34.897 --> 01:05:36.666
Trust what? That was random.

1758
01:05:36.832 --> 01:05:38.568
In 1, 2, 3.

1759
01:05:38.568 --> 01:05:40.036
Give me a fist bump.

1760
01:05:40.236 --> 01:05:43.839
(Give me some energy, my partner.)

1761
01:05:43.839 --> 01:05:45.341
- She's unlucky now. - Let's go.

1762
01:05:45.808 --> 01:05:47.944
(He spreads the unlucky energy.)

1763
01:05:47.944 --> 01:05:50.146
Kwang Soo has bad luck. Why did she fist bump him?

1764
01:05:50.513 --> 01:05:53.282
She's going to do poorly.

1765
01:05:54.383 --> 01:05:57.153
(She spins the roulette with the unlucky energy.)

1766
01:05:57.153 --> 01:05:58.387
She's going to get unlucky because of the fist bump.

1767
01:05:58.387 --> 01:05:59.655
It won't be us.

1768
01:05:59.989 --> 01:06:01.357
But she fist bumped you.

1769
01:06:01.357 --> 01:06:03.226
- True. - Please let it be Jae Seok.

1770
01:06:03.759 --> 01:06:05.561
It's Jae Seok.

1771
01:06:07.330 --> 01:06:10.900
(He gets to eat rice and seaweed for 5 weeks in a row.)

1772
01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.669
You get seaweed for the fifth week.

1773
01:06:14.203 --> 01:06:19.008
(He's sick of this simple menu.)

1774
01:06:19.675 --> 01:06:21.744
Let's see your numbers.

1775
01:06:21.744 --> 01:06:23.045
This shouldn't have happened.

1776
01:06:23.045 --> 01:06:25.081
Remember what I said?

1777
01:06:25.081 --> 01:06:26.415
What is your number, Jae Seok?

1778
01:06:28.050 --> 01:06:29.252
It's six.

1779
01:06:29.252 --> 01:06:30.486
- It's six? - See?

1780
01:06:30.486 --> 01:06:32.922
- They have the highest numbers. - They have 6 and 6.

1781
01:06:32.922 --> 01:06:35.157
- Her number is important. - What is your number, Ji Hyo?

1782
01:06:35.157 --> 01:06:36.759
- They have 6 and 6. - My gosh.

1783
01:06:37.293 --> 01:06:39.228
- We know now. - Isn't that incredible?

1784
01:06:39.228 --> 01:06:40.630
Hey.

1785
01:06:40.696 --> 01:06:43.032
If you have 4 or 5, you have to take theirs.

1786
01:06:43.032 --> 01:06:44.967
Do rock-paper-scissors, Ha Ra and Jong Kook.

1787
01:06:44.967 --> 01:06:46.102
- You have to split. - Let's go.

1788
01:06:47.036 --> 01:06:48.804
Rock-paper-scissors

1789
01:06:48.938 --> 01:06:50.973
(Ha Ra wins.)

1790
01:06:51.207 --> 01:06:53.643
- We know the highest. - Yes, right.

1791
01:06:53.676 --> 01:06:56.579
- I have to decide. - Don't we know the lowest too?

1792
01:06:56.579 --> 01:06:58.981
(Whose number will Ha Ra ask?)

1793
01:07:02.285 --> 01:07:05.488
(She's curious.)

1794
01:07:06.289 --> 01:07:10.693
(She hears the answer. What would she do?)

1795
01:07:10.693 --> 01:07:12.094
I'll eat first.

1796
01:07:12.094 --> 01:07:13.796
(I'll think about it as I eat.)

1797
01:07:13.796 --> 01:07:14.897
Thank you for the food.

1798
01:07:15.031 --> 01:07:16.332
Thank you for the food.

1799
01:07:16.332 --> 01:07:18.034
(Everybody but Jae Seok and Ji Hyo enjoys lunch.)

1800
01:07:18.034 --> 01:07:21.304
(The steak melts in my mouth.)

1801
01:07:22.171 --> 01:07:24.507
This is not just any sandwich. It's like a dish.

1802
01:07:24.507 --> 01:07:25.875
- It's really good. - Really?

1803
01:07:25.875 --> 01:07:27.376
Yes, the meat is soft.

1804
01:07:27.643 --> 01:07:28.844
Excuse me.

1805
01:07:29.445 --> 01:07:30.613
Is it good?

1806
01:07:30.613 --> 01:07:32.315
Of course. There's so much steak.

1807
01:07:32.315 --> 01:07:33.516
It's so good.

1808
01:07:33.683 --> 01:07:35.518
- Is the seaweed good? - It is,

1809
01:07:35.518 --> 01:07:37.053
but I've been having this for five weeks.

1810
01:07:37.053 --> 01:07:39.088
Put your head down, and eat.

1811
01:07:39.088 --> 01:07:41.123
- What? - Put your head down, and eat.

1812
01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:43.159
That's rude. You want me to put my head down and eat?

1813
01:07:43.159 --> 01:07:45.294
Put your head down, and eat.

1814
01:07:46.629 --> 01:07:47.963
- Here. - Jae Seok.

1815
01:07:49.131 --> 01:07:50.366
Jae Seok.

1816
01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:53.235
(What do you think? Doesn't it look good?)

1817
01:07:53.235 --> 01:07:55.071
Stop doing that.

1818
01:07:55.805 --> 01:07:57.340
It's really good.

1819
01:07:57.340 --> 01:07:58.507
(Have some, Jae Seok.)

1820
01:07:59.275 --> 01:08:01.811
(Have my finger.)

1821
01:08:02.178 --> 01:08:04.947
(He knew it would be like this.)

1822
01:08:04.947 --> 01:08:06.449
- Hey. - That was mean.

1823
01:08:06.449 --> 01:08:07.650
You put your finger in?

1824
01:08:08.217 --> 01:08:09.385
That was so cute.

1825
01:08:09.385 --> 01:08:10.686
Please give me a bite.

1826
01:08:10.686 --> 01:08:12.588
(Give me a bite.)

1827
01:08:12.588 --> 01:08:15.725
(Screaming)

1828
01:08:16.826 --> 01:08:17.960
(Ji Hyo joins as well.)

1829
01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:18.961
- Jong Kook. - It's so good.

1830
01:08:18.961 --> 01:08:20.429
Can I have a piece of the steak?

1831
01:08:20.429 --> 01:08:21.664
You have a cold.

1832
01:08:21.697 --> 01:08:24.066
- Ha Ra has a cold as well. - He'll catch a cold.

1833
01:08:24.066 --> 01:08:25.668
Both Ha Ra and I have a cold,

1834
01:08:25.668 --> 01:08:28.104
- but why is she fine and I'm not? - He'll catch a cold.

1835
01:08:28.104 --> 01:08:29.705
- I catch colds easily. - Mina.

1836
01:08:32.007 --> 01:08:35.611
(She coughs on the steak.)

1837
01:08:36.379 --> 01:08:37.513
Da Hee.

1838
01:08:37.780 --> 01:08:38.948
I'm a sea elephant.

1839
01:08:38.948 --> 01:08:41.617
(He tries to get a bite of Da Hee's sandwich.)

1840
01:08:41.617 --> 01:08:45.688
(Isn't it funny? Don't you want to give me a bite?)

1841
01:08:46.789 --> 01:08:49.492
(Give a bite to the sea elephant.)

1842
01:08:49.492 --> 01:08:50.760
Whose is this?

1843
01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:53.229
(He bites into Kwang Soo's sandwich.)

1844
01:08:53.229 --> 01:08:54.563
Hey.

1845
01:08:54.563 --> 01:08:55.831
There's no meat.

1846
01:08:56.832 --> 01:08:58.134
Where's the meat?

1847
01:08:58.134 --> 01:09:00.169
(There's no meat in the sandwich?)

1848
01:09:00.169 --> 01:09:01.437
Where's the meat?

1849
01:09:01.437 --> 01:09:03.672
(The meat is missing. Who took it?)

1850
01:09:03.672 --> 01:09:05.174
What happened to the meat?

1851
01:09:05.508 --> 01:09:06.809
Is it gone?

1852
01:09:08.377 --> 01:09:11.113
(It was chaotic 1 minute ago.)

1853
01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:13.416
(Lifting)

1854
01:09:13.983 --> 01:09:18.020
(Da Hee grabbed the meat...)

1855
01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:21.257
(and stole it.)

1856
01:09:21.257 --> 01:09:24.160
(She covered up her crime because Jae Seok came by.)

1857
01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:26.429
What? What happened?

1858
01:09:26.695 --> 01:09:28.230
What happened to my meat?

1859
01:09:28.230 --> 01:09:29.432
Hey.

1860
01:09:29.799 --> 01:09:31.000
(She tries to keep a poker face.)

1861
01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.201
Did you eat mine?

1862
01:09:32.368 --> 01:09:33.602
(She fails.)

1863
01:09:33.602 --> 01:09:34.970
Did you eat mine?

1864
01:09:36.372 --> 01:09:38.541
No, right? Where's my meat?

1865
01:09:41.577 --> 01:09:43.179
Let me see your pocket.

1866
01:09:43.212 --> 01:09:45.014
You ate it, right? Open your mouth.

1867
01:09:45.281 --> 01:09:47.216
Open your mouth.

1868
01:09:47.383 --> 01:09:49.985
- Open your mouth. Where is it? - Hey.

1869
01:09:50.319 --> 01:09:52.488
- What happened to the meat? - My meat...

1870
01:09:53.489 --> 01:09:57.193
(Give me my meat back.)

1871
01:09:57.193 --> 01:09:58.494
No.

1872
01:09:58.494 --> 01:10:00.529
(Justice is served.)

1873
01:10:00.529 --> 01:10:04.099
(They quarrel several times today.)

1874
01:10:04.567 --> 01:10:06.335
(Give me my meat.)

1875
01:10:07.303 --> 01:10:09.004
(Give me some too.)

1876
01:10:09.705 --> 01:10:11.106
(She kept the meat.)

1877
01:10:11.106 --> 01:10:12.408
Gosh, Da Hee.

1878
01:10:12.508 --> 01:10:14.376
She wasn't like that before.

1879
01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:17.012
Da Hee wasn't like that.

1880
01:10:17.012 --> 01:10:18.414
(I like meat more as I get older.)

1881
01:10:18.414 --> 01:10:19.515
Ji Hyo.

1882
01:10:19.515 --> 01:10:21.650
I got some meat for you.

1883
01:10:22.485 --> 01:10:24.086
Put some meat on top.

1884
01:10:24.787 --> 01:10:25.955
Look.

1885
01:10:26.856 --> 01:10:28.157
(This is sad.)

1886
01:10:28.157 --> 01:10:29.959
- Ji Hyo. - Goodness.

1887
01:10:29.992 --> 01:10:31.594
- I'm going to cry. - Heungbu...

1888
01:10:31.594 --> 01:10:32.962
Heungbu is not a fictional character.

1889
01:10:33.095 --> 01:10:36.098
Don't just eat the seaweed. Eat some meat too.

1890
01:10:36.465 --> 01:10:38.534
He's so desperate.

1891
01:10:38.534 --> 01:10:39.635
- See? - My gosh.

1892
01:10:40.769 --> 01:10:42.404
(Grabbing)

1893
01:10:43.472 --> 01:10:46.675
(He steals Jae Seok's food in his own way.)

1894
01:10:46.675 --> 01:10:47.877
Gosh.

1895
01:10:49.044 --> 01:10:50.379
Look at him.

1896
01:10:51.046 --> 01:10:54.116
If you're done eating, let's see what Ha Ra will do.

1897
01:10:54.116 --> 01:10:57.953
(It's time for Ha Ra to switch her teams.)

1898
01:10:58.654 --> 01:11:01.156
It's okay, Ha Ra. I've had the water bomb on me many times.

1899
01:11:01.156 --> 01:11:02.791
(It's okay, Ha Ra. I'll honor your decision.)

1900
01:11:03.425 --> 01:11:04.660
I...

1901
01:11:05.294 --> 01:11:06.495
will change.

1902
01:11:06.495 --> 01:11:07.630
She's going to switch.

1903
01:11:07.630 --> 01:11:08.864
- Yes. - With whom?

1904
01:11:08.864 --> 01:11:12.601
(Whom is she going to switch Jong Kook with?)

1905
01:11:12.601 --> 01:11:14.770
Jae Seok.

1906
01:11:14.770 --> 01:11:16.505
(She wants to be a couple with Jae Seok.)

1907
01:11:16.505 --> 01:11:18.274
She has a high number too.

1908
01:11:18.274 --> 01:11:20.943
Ji Hyo and Ha Ra, please switch seats.

1909
01:11:21.176 --> 01:11:24.113
Hold on. Are Jong Kook and Ji Hyo a couple then?

1910
01:11:25.147 --> 01:11:26.649
Why is it them?

1911
01:11:26.649 --> 01:11:28.417
What? Is there something going on?

1912
01:11:28.417 --> 01:11:29.785
Do we finally get to see it?

1913
01:11:30.419 --> 01:11:32.855
I didn't give her steak earlier.

1914
01:11:33.355 --> 01:11:35.391
(We're not in good terms.)

1915
01:11:35.391 --> 01:11:36.926
We're not in good terms right now.

1916
01:11:38.294 --> 01:11:40.095
(She gets up.)

1917
01:11:40.095 --> 01:11:42.331
(Coughing)

1918
01:11:42.798 --> 01:11:43.966
Have a seaweed, Jong Kook.

1919
01:11:43.966 --> 01:11:45.067
It's okay, Ji Hyo.

1920
01:11:45.067 --> 01:11:47.670
I have meat. Have some.

1921
01:11:47.703 --> 01:11:49.705
- Have some. - You like meat. You can have it.

1922
01:11:49.705 --> 01:11:50.773
No, it's for you.

1923
01:11:50.773 --> 01:11:51.974
You like meat.

1924
01:11:51.974 --> 01:11:53.108
No, Ji Hyo. Take it.

1925
01:11:55.711 --> 01:11:57.012
What's this?

1926
01:11:57.413 --> 01:11:58.614
- Are you insane? - What are you doing?

1927
01:11:58.614 --> 01:11:59.682
- What are you doing? - What's this?

1928
01:11:59.682 --> 01:12:00.983
I'm celebrating.

1929
01:12:01.016 --> 01:12:02.284
What are you doing?

1930
01:12:02.685 --> 01:12:03.819
What's that?

1931
01:12:03.819 --> 01:12:05.220
- Is he celebrating again? - Why?

1932
01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:07.690
(Jong Kook and Ji Hyo are back together, so it's a happy occasion.)

1933
01:12:07.690 --> 01:12:09.058
- Does he want the meat? - That's for me?

1934
01:12:09.058 --> 01:12:10.826
(They move to the final location now.)

1935
01:12:11.293 --> 01:12:12.728
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1936
01:12:12.728 --> 01:12:14.263
(A college in Jeju Island)

1937
01:12:14.263 --> 01:12:16.198
There are...

1938
01:12:16.198 --> 01:12:18.367
- so many new things in Jeju Island. - This looks awesome.

1939
01:12:18.801 --> 01:12:20.069
Goodness.

1940
01:12:20.069 --> 01:12:21.203
(Their eyes open wide.)

1941
01:12:21.403 --> 01:12:23.672
- This is awesome. - What's that?

1942
01:12:23.672 --> 01:12:24.773
(There are toys everywhere.)

1943
01:12:24.773 --> 01:12:26.775
- Look. - Goodness.

1944
01:12:27.042 --> 01:12:28.677
Look at the stadium.

1945
01:12:28.677 --> 01:12:30.512
(Their average age is 40, but they're still amazed.)

1946
01:12:30.646 --> 01:12:32.181
These are all blocks.

1947
01:12:32.815 --> 01:12:35.184
(Is there something more?)

1948
01:12:35.184 --> 01:12:36.919
- Gosh. - Goodness.

1949
01:12:36.919 --> 01:12:38.621
That's me.

1950
01:12:38.621 --> 01:12:40.155
These are blocks as well.

1951
01:12:40.155 --> 01:12:41.857
- It says "Running Man". - It does.

1952
01:12:41.857 --> 01:12:43.225
It's written here.

1953
01:12:43.225 --> 01:12:45.427
This is the final mission...

1954
01:12:45.427 --> 01:12:47.496
where you get to earn a Chance Card.

1955
01:12:47.496 --> 01:12:50.332
- We have to win here. - The winner takes all.

1956
01:12:50.666 --> 01:12:53.569
The final mission is called the Pirate Roulette Quiz.

1957
01:12:53.636 --> 01:12:54.903
Because it's the pirate?

1958
01:12:55.004 --> 01:12:59.174
- Each couple gets 40 knives. - Okay.

1959
01:12:59.174 --> 01:13:01.176
Listen to the question, and if you want a chance to answer,

1960
01:13:01.176 --> 01:13:03.712
insert the number of knives you want in the Betting Pirate.

1961
01:13:03.712 --> 01:13:05.814
If the pirate doesn't pop up, you win the bet.

1962
01:13:05.814 --> 01:13:08.517
The couple who bets the most knives gets to answer.

1963
01:13:08.517 --> 01:13:10.819
I know this. I'll explain.

1964
01:13:10.853 --> 01:13:12.421
But there's something else.

1965
01:13:12.421 --> 01:13:13.922
(It's not that simple.)

1966
01:13:13.922 --> 01:13:15.724
You have to insert the number of knives...

1967
01:13:15.724 --> 01:13:18.360
according to the multiple choice in the Answer Pirate.

1968
01:13:18.627 --> 01:13:21.463
You only get to answer if the pirate doesn't pop up.

1969
01:13:22.297 --> 01:13:24.633
For example, if the answer is two,

1970
01:13:24.633 --> 01:13:26.535
you have to insert two knives into the Answer Pirate.

1971
01:13:27.770 --> 01:13:30.305
If we don't win, we lose.

1972
01:13:30.305 --> 01:13:31.340
(The couple with the most number of knives wins.)

1973
01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:33.575
Before we start the last mission,

1974
01:13:33.575 --> 01:13:36.478
I'll tell you the highest and lowest combination of numbers.

1975
01:13:36.578 --> 01:13:38.614
The highest number combination...

1976
01:13:39.048 --> 01:13:40.482
is 10.

1977
01:13:40.616 --> 01:13:41.850
- 10? - What?

1978
01:13:42.418 --> 01:13:44.586
(We have the highest numbers.)

1979
01:13:44.586 --> 01:13:45.788
We were right.

1980
01:13:45.788 --> 01:13:47.256
The lowest number combination...

1981
01:13:47.556 --> 01:13:49.458
- is 2. - 2?

1982
01:13:49.792 --> 01:13:51.293
- It's not us. - 1 and 1?

1983
01:13:51.293 --> 01:13:53.028
- Two? - Does that make sense?

1984
01:13:53.028 --> 01:13:54.129
(There's a couple who's lower than Seok Jin and So Min?)

1985
01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:55.998
(The male member who had 1...)

1986
01:13:55.998 --> 01:13:58.333
(was Se Chan.)

1987
01:13:58.333 --> 01:14:00.436
(With the Chance Card,)

1988
01:14:00.436 --> 01:14:03.906
(he got to partner up with Mina.)

1989
01:14:04.773 --> 01:14:05.941
Mina.

1990
01:14:06.041 --> 01:14:08.277
- We don't know each other's. - We don't.

1991
01:14:08.277 --> 01:14:09.478
Excuse me.

1992
01:14:09.812 --> 01:14:11.547
Mina is acting right now.

1993
01:14:11.547 --> 01:14:13.716
(Look at her face.)

1994
01:14:13.716 --> 01:14:15.884
- I'm disappointed, Mina. - She's playing dumb.

1995
01:14:15.884 --> 01:14:18.053
- You lied when we were eating. - What?

1996
01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:20.689
No, you have to see the end result.

1997
01:14:21.056 --> 01:14:22.224
Earlier,

1998
01:14:22.224 --> 01:14:25.294
Se Chan switched with Kwang Soo for a higher number.

1999
01:14:25.327 --> 01:14:26.995
They must be 1 and 1.

2000
01:14:26.995 --> 01:14:28.897
- It's them or them. - But...

2001
01:14:28.997 --> 01:14:30.165
it's not us.

2002
01:14:30.165 --> 01:14:32.034
You're going to reveal who's in first place, right?

2003
01:14:32.034 --> 01:14:34.403
Can you not say anything, Kwang Soo?

2004
01:14:34.403 --> 01:14:36.105
- Stop saying anything. - It must be them.

2005
01:14:36.138 --> 01:14:37.873
- It's them or them. - It's them.

2006
01:14:37.873 --> 01:14:40.409
It's them. She's not saying anything.

2007
01:14:40.676 --> 01:14:43.579
Da Hee is not saying anything.

2008
01:14:43.579 --> 01:14:45.347
No, that's not it.

2009
01:14:45.347 --> 01:14:46.648
- What is it? - Just...

2010
01:14:46.682 --> 01:14:49.251
I just want to play the game.

2011
01:14:49.251 --> 01:14:51.487
- You're the weirdest at the moment. - No.

2012
01:14:51.487 --> 01:14:52.821
What are you talking about?

2013
01:14:53.455 --> 01:14:54.890
It's them.

2014
01:14:54.890 --> 01:14:57.226
(The couple with the lowest numbers is not suspected anymore.)

2015
01:14:57.226 --> 01:14:59.428
It's Da Hee. It's in her name.

2016
01:15:00.129 --> 01:15:02.097
Let's get started. We have to play first.

2017
01:15:02.164 --> 01:15:03.599
- Please give us the question. - All right.

2018
01:15:03.599 --> 01:15:05.634
Here's the first question.

2019
01:15:06.568 --> 01:15:08.170
In Korean,

2020
01:15:08.303 --> 01:15:12.541
what's the word for "continuing to do the same work"?

2021
01:15:12.541 --> 01:15:14.143
This is too easy.

2022
01:15:14.143 --> 01:15:16.378
One, Gabdori.

2023
01:15:16.645 --> 01:15:18.647
Two, Samdori.

2024
01:15:20.048 --> 01:15:22.117
Three, Sundori.

2025
01:15:22.117 --> 01:15:23.418
Is that it?

2026
01:15:23.418 --> 01:15:25.354
Four, Gomdori.

2027
01:15:25.921 --> 01:15:27.289
"Gomdori"?

2028
01:15:27.489 --> 01:15:29.324
Five, Baedori.

2029
01:15:29.625 --> 01:15:31.193
Five! I mean, answer.

2030
01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:33.829
(Shouting)

2031
01:15:33.829 --> 01:15:35.330
I know.

2032
01:15:35.330 --> 01:15:36.899
- That's not what you do. - I'm sorry.

2033
01:15:36.899 --> 01:15:38.300
I'm sorry.

2034
01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:39.902
- Do something about her. - We're not two.

2035
01:15:39.902 --> 01:15:40.969
We're not two.

2036
01:15:40.969 --> 01:15:42.271
Why is she doing that?

2037
01:15:42.271 --> 01:15:43.939
I don't know. I'm sorry.

2038
01:15:44.106 --> 01:15:45.774
- Why is she trying so hard to win? - She's suspicious.

2039
01:15:45.774 --> 01:15:46.975
Switch. Okay.

2040
01:15:46.975 --> 01:15:48.877
- What is wrong with her? - I'm sorry.

2041
01:15:48.877 --> 01:15:49.878
(We need to bet first, right?)

2042
01:15:49.878 --> 01:15:52.347
Please bet. You can bet after saying, "answer".

2043
01:15:52.648 --> 01:15:54.850
- Do you know this? - It's five, Baedori.

2044
01:15:54.850 --> 01:15:55.884
Really?

2045
01:15:55.884 --> 01:15:57.319
- Answer. - Answer.

2046
01:15:57.319 --> 01:15:58.353
How many would you like to bet?

2047
01:15:58.353 --> 01:16:01.390
We'll bet seven.

2048
01:16:01.490 --> 01:16:02.925
- That's a lot. - Answer.

2049
01:16:03.725 --> 01:16:04.993
- It's too... - We'll bet eight.

2050
01:16:04.993 --> 01:16:06.061
Eight?

2051
01:16:06.061 --> 01:16:08.230
If the pirate pops up, they're done for.

2052
01:16:08.230 --> 01:16:11.533
Let's go. In 1, 2, 3.

2053
01:16:11.533 --> 01:16:12.734
- Okay. - It's my turn.

2054
01:16:12.734 --> 01:16:14.870
You have to insert all the knives.

2055
01:16:14.870 --> 01:16:16.271
It's shaking.

2056
01:16:16.271 --> 01:16:18.140
Okay. One more. Please.

2057
01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:20.008
- Please, In A. - Pop up.

2058
01:16:21.944 --> 01:16:23.145
Okay.

2059
01:16:23.345 --> 01:16:25.948
You have to insert eight knives.

2060
01:16:25.948 --> 01:16:27.416
We'll do that.

2061
01:16:27.449 --> 01:16:28.917
I'm so nervous.

2062
01:16:29.618 --> 01:16:31.186
I'm nervous every time we do this.

2063
01:16:31.353 --> 01:16:33.922
- Should we take turns inserting? - Sure.

2064
01:16:33.922 --> 01:16:35.657
Pop up. I hope it explodes.

2065
01:16:36.458 --> 01:16:37.926
I want it to pop up.

2066
01:16:38.193 --> 01:16:39.962
Jae Seok is nasty.

2067
01:16:41.063 --> 01:16:42.464
- Kwang Soo... - Okay.

2068
01:16:42.464 --> 01:16:43.799
(Kwang Soo succeeds despite Jae Seok's remark.)

2069
01:16:43.799 --> 01:16:45.734
- As long as you don't lose... - If we win, we get a chance.

2070
01:16:45.734 --> 01:16:47.402
I know. You have to be careful.

2071
01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:49.104
No.

2072
01:16:49.104 --> 01:16:50.906
This is dangerous. It's risky from now on.

2073
01:16:51.273 --> 01:16:52.741
We know the answer.

2074
01:16:54.076 --> 01:16:55.377
Okay.

2075
01:16:55.878 --> 01:16:57.145
One more. Let's go.

2076
01:16:57.145 --> 01:16:58.914
- Pop up. Make this fun. - Pop up.

2077
01:16:58.914 --> 01:17:00.482
Da Hee, if you lose here, you're the real star.

2078
01:17:00.482 --> 01:17:01.483
You're the best entertainer.

2079
01:17:01.483 --> 01:17:03.385
- Da Hee knows the exact answer. - The queen of variety shows.

2080
01:17:03.385 --> 01:17:05.621
- The queen of variety shows. - The queen of variety shows.

2081
01:17:05.621 --> 01:17:07.589
Here I go!

2082
01:17:09.324 --> 01:17:10.392
Okay.

2083
01:17:10.392 --> 01:17:12.327
(They win by betting 8 knives.)

2084
01:17:13.729 --> 01:17:15.831
- You have to bet two more. - Let's go.

2085
01:17:15.831 --> 01:17:17.199
- They're doing it. - Good job.

2086
01:17:17.699 --> 01:17:19.101
- Let's go. - Great.

2087
01:17:19.101 --> 01:17:21.737
- Please. - You have no choice.

2088
01:17:22.371 --> 01:17:24.473
(Please)

2089
01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:26.074
(They get one.)

2090
01:17:26.074 --> 01:17:27.276
Do the next one.

2091
01:17:27.576 --> 01:17:28.877
I think you're good at this.

2092
01:17:29.144 --> 01:17:30.579
This is unbelievable.

2093
01:17:30.846 --> 01:17:32.748
Please. Please.

2094
01:17:33.248 --> 01:17:34.383
Okay.

2095
01:17:34.383 --> 01:17:35.517
(Shrieking)

2096
01:17:37.119 --> 01:17:39.621
(They lose the bet.)

2097
01:17:40.122 --> 01:17:42.324
(Things were going too well.)

2098
01:17:42.324 --> 01:17:43.859
(She makes weird noises.)

2099
01:17:43.859 --> 01:17:48.563
Before she finished hearing the options, she knew the answer.

2100
01:17:49.364 --> 01:17:51.333
Insert the number of knives according to the multiple choice.

2101
01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:56.805
(They get to answer after inserting the knives in the Answer Pirate.)

2102
01:17:58.941 --> 01:18:00.542
If the pirate pops up, they're done, right?

2103
01:18:00.709 --> 01:18:02.277
If the pirate pops up, they're done.

2104
01:18:02.544 --> 01:18:03.712
The answer is...

2105
01:18:03.912 --> 01:18:05.280
number two.

2106
01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:06.615
Number two?

2107
01:18:06.615 --> 01:18:07.816
- Samdori. - Right.

2108
01:18:07.816 --> 01:18:09.184
- Samdori? - That's not true.

2109
01:18:09.184 --> 01:18:10.752
- Insert 2 knives. - Isn't it 5, Baedori?

2110
01:18:10.752 --> 01:18:12.254
- She was certain. - Really?

2111
01:18:12.254 --> 01:18:13.422
Really?

2112
01:18:13.655 --> 01:18:15.023
Isn't it Baedori?

2113
01:18:15.090 --> 01:18:17.159
(She bet 2, instead of 5.)

2114
01:18:17.159 --> 01:18:19.328
- Pop up. - The queen of variety shows.

2115
01:18:19.328 --> 01:18:21.196
(If they win here, they get to answer.)

2116
01:18:21.964 --> 01:18:23.098
Okay.

2117
01:18:23.498 --> 01:18:24.666
Answer?

2118
01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:26.435
- What's the answer? - Maybe they're right.

2119
01:18:27.169 --> 01:18:28.570
- They said Samdori. - Samdori?

2120
01:18:28.570 --> 01:18:31.073
Two, Samdori...

2121
01:18:31.406 --> 01:18:33.442
(It's wrong.)

2122
01:18:33.442 --> 01:18:34.710
It's wrong.

2123
01:18:34.977 --> 01:18:36.712
(It's not Samdori.)

2124
01:18:36.712 --> 01:18:38.847
- I think they're done. - They lost it.

2125
01:18:38.847 --> 01:18:39.948
This is awesome.

2126
01:18:39.948 --> 01:18:41.016
(They lost even more.)

2127
01:18:41.350 --> 01:18:44.820
Let's get a new Betting Pirate.

2128
01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:46.588
- We'll get a new one. - A new one?

2129
01:18:46.588 --> 01:18:47.956
The betting starts over?

2130
01:18:48.890 --> 01:18:51.093
I'm not certain. We'll bet seven.

2131
01:18:51.526 --> 01:18:53.462
- How many do we have to do? - Think about this.

2132
01:18:53.462 --> 01:18:54.663
Eight?

2133
01:18:55.397 --> 01:18:56.832
What's the answer?

2134
01:18:56.832 --> 01:18:57.966
(We lost 10 already.)

2135
01:18:57.966 --> 01:18:59.868
So what if the pirate doesn't pop up?

2136
01:18:59.868 --> 01:19:01.103
Let's go.

2137
01:19:01.103 --> 01:19:02.504
(She's uneasy.)

2138
01:19:02.604 --> 01:19:04.606
- Please. - This one could be funny too.

2139
01:19:04.639 --> 01:19:06.074
Let's do this.

2140
01:19:06.341 --> 01:19:07.843
- Let's go. - Please.

2141
01:19:07.843 --> 01:19:09.211
- This one could be funny too. - Let's go.

2142
01:19:09.211 --> 01:19:10.312
Ha Ra, one more.

2143
01:19:10.312 --> 01:19:12.014
The queen of variety shows.

2144
01:19:12.014 --> 01:19:13.448
- Ha Ra. - Okay.

2145
01:19:13.448 --> 01:19:15.584
- Don't feel pressured. - Jae Seok.

2146
01:19:15.584 --> 01:19:17.119
Okay, good.

2147
01:19:17.119 --> 01:19:18.120
Good job.

2148
01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:20.222
(Jae Seok is unusually bold, and they bet 7.)

2149
01:19:20.222 --> 01:19:21.390
- Come on. - Nice.

2150
01:19:21.456 --> 01:19:22.824
This is great.

2151
01:19:22.824 --> 01:19:23.992
What's the answer?

2152
01:19:24.559 --> 01:19:26.061
Which option is it?

2153
01:19:26.194 --> 01:19:28.530
- It's 5. - It's 2.

2154
01:19:28.597 --> 01:19:30.532
- It's 5, Baedori. - 5, Baedori?

2155
01:19:30.532 --> 01:19:32.000
- Please insert the knives. - It's five, Baedori.

2156
01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:34.436
Please pop up.

2157
01:19:34.436 --> 01:19:35.804
(They have to insert 5 knives.)

2158
01:19:35.837 --> 01:19:37.372
I don't know.

2159
01:19:37.973 --> 01:19:39.241
Please.

2160
01:19:39.241 --> 01:19:40.609
(She's careful.)

2161
01:19:41.309 --> 01:19:43.979
Pop up. Pop up.

2162
01:19:44.012 --> 01:19:46.014
- There's one left. - It'll pop up.

2163
01:19:46.014 --> 01:19:47.215
Please let this be funny.

2164
01:19:47.215 --> 01:19:49.017
You have many spaces left.

2165
01:19:49.017 --> 01:19:50.352
(Jae Seok is usually unlucky.)

2166
01:19:50.352 --> 01:19:51.987
Pop up.

2167
01:19:52.721 --> 01:19:54.122
- Pop up. - Gosh.

2168
01:19:54.122 --> 01:19:55.524
(They get a chance to answer.)

2169
01:19:55.524 --> 01:19:57.926
- Nice. - Five, Baedori.

2170
01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:00.195
(It's wrong.)

2171
01:20:00.195 --> 01:20:01.496
- Yes. - Yes.

2172
01:20:01.530 --> 01:20:03.932
(It's not 5?)

2173
01:20:03.932 --> 01:20:05.100
(This is so much fun.)

2174
01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:10.305
This is awesome.

2175
01:20:10.372 --> 01:20:12.974
This is driving me nuts.

2176
01:20:13.041 --> 01:20:14.509
What do we do now?

2177
01:20:14.709 --> 01:20:16.111
- Answer. - It's Gabdori or Samdori.

2178
01:20:16.111 --> 01:20:17.512
- Answer. - We bet six.

2179
01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:20.115
- Okay. - All right.

2180
01:20:20.415 --> 01:20:21.683
Okay.

2181
01:20:22.284 --> 01:20:23.618
- We'll bet. - You have to bet seven.

2182
01:20:23.618 --> 01:20:24.820
We'll bet seven.

2183
01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:26.588
- I'll do three this time. - Can they bet?

2184
01:20:27.422 --> 01:20:28.990
Do you know the answer?

2185
01:20:28.990 --> 01:20:31.026
- Of course. - We can bet.

2186
01:20:31.026 --> 01:20:33.095
- Of course. - I don't know.

2187
01:20:37.766 --> 01:20:38.900
Oh, dear.

2188
01:20:38.900 --> 01:20:40.435
(In A does it again.)

2189
01:20:40.936 --> 01:20:42.070
(She's the new unlucky person.)

2190
01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:44.306
- Put that down. - Give up your knives, Haha.

2191
01:20:45.207 --> 01:20:47.209
I thought she was lucky.

2192
01:20:47.209 --> 01:20:48.977
(She seems to be the unlucky one.)

2193
01:20:48.977 --> 01:20:50.112
Let's bet.

2194
01:20:50.112 --> 01:20:52.514
(This is her new, hidden talent.)

2195
01:20:52.514 --> 01:20:53.815
Let's give up.

2196
01:20:54.149 --> 01:20:56.685
What's the answer?

2197
01:20:56.818 --> 01:20:58.453
We'll go with three, Sundori.

2198
01:20:58.820 --> 01:21:00.355
Three, Sundori. Please insert the knives.

2199
01:21:01.123 --> 01:21:02.958
- Please don't pop up. - You can't pop up.

2200
01:21:02.958 --> 01:21:04.159
It'll be really funny if it does.

2201
01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:06.027
Goodness.

2202
01:21:06.027 --> 01:21:07.162
(It'll be really funny if it does.)

2203
01:21:07.162 --> 01:21:09.231
(Goodness)

2204
01:21:09.231 --> 01:21:10.966
This is great. Let's do this.

2205
01:21:10.966 --> 01:21:12.734
Let's bet.

2206
01:21:12.734 --> 01:21:14.136
Does this make sense?

2207
01:21:14.136 --> 01:21:16.037
(Great job, Pirate.)

2208
01:21:16.037 --> 01:21:17.272
Nice.

2209
01:21:17.272 --> 01:21:19.040
We'll be done in one round.

2210
01:21:19.508 --> 01:21:22.611
It's like what I made him do for the TV rating notice.

2211
01:21:22.611 --> 01:21:23.879
His can is always empty.

2212
01:21:23.879 --> 01:21:25.547
(It's exactly like the reality.)

2213
01:21:25.547 --> 01:21:26.915
Is the can yours?

2214
01:21:26.982 --> 01:21:29.518
(The pirate is reborn again.)

2215
01:21:29.518 --> 01:21:31.553
- How many are you betting? - I'm betting seven.

2216
01:21:32.053 --> 01:21:35.524
- This is unbelievable. - We were almost there.

2217
01:21:38.827 --> 01:21:41.163
(The pirate keeps on popping up.)

2218
01:21:41.163 --> 01:21:44.032
This is unbelievable.

2219
01:21:44.032 --> 01:21:45.467
What just happened?

2220
01:21:45.467 --> 01:21:46.935
I'm sorry.

2221
01:21:46.935 --> 01:21:48.937
What just happened?

2222
01:21:48.937 --> 01:21:50.272
Is that even possible?

2223
01:21:50.272 --> 01:21:52.340
- We'll bet seven. - Okay.

2224
01:21:52.340 --> 01:21:53.642
Let's get it back.

2225
01:21:53.642 --> 01:21:55.010
- Ji Hyo. - I'll take three.

2226
01:21:55.010 --> 01:21:56.645
Do four. You're lucky.

2227
01:21:56.645 --> 01:21:58.213
How did you do that, Kwang Soo?

2228
01:21:58.713 --> 01:22:00.115
Do you know before you do it?

2229
01:22:00.115 --> 01:22:02.484
- It'll be awesome if it pops up. - He can't know.

2230
01:22:02.551 --> 01:22:03.952
I guess it could happen.

2231
01:22:03.952 --> 01:22:05.353
Pop up.

2232
01:22:06.288 --> 01:22:08.924
They're too...

2233
01:22:08.957 --> 01:22:10.392
lucky.

2234
01:22:10.392 --> 01:22:12.761
Ji Hyo, can you insert it in a bad spot?

2235
01:22:13.862 --> 01:22:15.463
(The pirate is quiet now.)

2236
01:22:15.463 --> 01:22:17.432
We'll go. We bet eight.

2237
01:22:17.432 --> 01:22:18.533
Eight.

2238
01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:19.968
Please.

2239
01:22:19.968 --> 01:22:21.670
It has to pop up.

2240
01:22:21.670 --> 01:22:23.772
It has to pop up for us.

2241
01:22:24.339 --> 01:22:25.807
It has to pop up.

2242
01:22:25.807 --> 01:22:27.275
- Slow down. - It has to pop up.

2243
01:22:27.609 --> 01:22:29.611
- Good. - It has to happen.

2244
01:22:29.611 --> 01:22:30.879
It has to pop up.

2245
01:22:30.879 --> 01:22:33.248
My gosh. You potty pants.

2246
01:22:34.549 --> 01:22:35.717
(My gosh.)

2247
01:22:35.717 --> 01:22:37.385
(You potty pants.)

2248
01:22:37.385 --> 01:22:38.987
Hey.

2249
01:22:38.987 --> 01:22:40.589
- That was great. - You're so unlucky.

2250
01:22:41.089 --> 01:22:43.825
- You're so unlucky. - What is she doing now?

2251
01:22:43.858 --> 01:22:45.560
Why are you doing that all of a sudden?

2252
01:22:45.827 --> 01:22:48.330
- She's the female Kwang Soo. - This is great.

2253
01:22:48.663 --> 01:22:51.333
That was diarrhea.

2254
01:22:51.333 --> 01:22:52.701
That was poop.

2255
01:22:52.734 --> 01:22:54.236
Please.

2256
01:22:54.803 --> 01:22:56.204
- This is over. - The answer is...

2257
01:22:56.204 --> 01:22:58.673
- four, Gomdori. - Gomdori?

2258
01:22:58.773 --> 01:23:00.342
Is it really Gomdori?

2259
01:23:01.476 --> 01:23:03.078
How many did we lose?

2260
01:23:03.078 --> 01:23:05.313
- That was shocking. - Wasn't that around 20?

2261
01:23:05.313 --> 01:23:07.015
- They're done. - We're done.

2262
01:23:07.015 --> 01:23:08.550
They're all done.

2263
01:23:08.917 --> 01:23:11.486
Currently, first place team is...

2264
01:23:11.486 --> 01:23:13.221
Se Chan and Mina with 32 knives.

2265
01:23:14.723 --> 01:23:15.890
Us?

2266
01:23:15.957 --> 01:23:18.360
We didn't bet. They bet eight.

2267
01:23:18.860 --> 01:23:20.695
(Here's the last question.)

2268
01:23:20.695 --> 01:23:22.264
Here's the last question.

2269
01:23:23.164 --> 01:23:24.766
(I'm going to get it right this time.)

2270
01:23:24.766 --> 01:23:28.737
During the Joseon Dynasty, if you sent this overnight...

2271
01:23:28.737 --> 01:23:32.907
from Namhansanseong Fortress to Seoul, it arrived by daybreak,

2272
01:23:32.907 --> 01:23:35.076
so it was called the Daybreak Soup.

2273
01:23:35.810 --> 01:23:39.648
This is also the first delivery food in Korea. What is this?

2274
01:23:39.648 --> 01:23:40.782
Delivery food?

2275
01:23:40.815 --> 01:23:43.218
- From Namhansanseong Fortress? - One, boiled pork.

2276
01:23:43.652 --> 01:23:45.620
Two, trotters.

2277
01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:47.689
Three, chicken soup.

2278
01:23:47.689 --> 01:23:49.457
Four, jjajangmyeon.

2279
01:23:50.091 --> 01:23:51.726
Five, hangover soup.

2280
01:23:52.661 --> 01:23:54.696
- This is difficult. - What kind of question is this?

2281
01:23:54.696 --> 01:23:55.797
Answer.

2282
01:23:56.031 --> 01:23:57.666
I'll bet 10.

2283
01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.368
I'll bet 11.

2284
01:24:00.368 --> 01:24:01.936
Jae Seok, do you know?

2285
01:24:01.936 --> 01:24:03.772
- We have to bet. - Let's watch.

2286
01:24:04.005 --> 01:24:05.573
Why did you bet 10?

2287
01:24:05.573 --> 01:24:07.342
It's one, boiled pork.

2288
01:24:07.342 --> 01:24:09.844
People eat it when they move, right?

2289
01:24:10.745 --> 01:24:13.948
I've delivered food. They don't deliver hangover soup.

2290
01:24:14.049 --> 01:24:15.517
- Let's do this. - It's 10.

2291
01:24:15.517 --> 01:24:16.718
Let's do it together.

2292
01:24:17.218 --> 01:24:21.189
In 1, 2, 3.

2293
01:24:21.189 --> 01:24:22.891
(Haha gets one.)

2294
01:24:23.591 --> 01:24:25.493
What's wrong with her?

2295
01:24:27.429 --> 01:24:29.397
(She escapes from the reality.)

2296
01:24:29.397 --> 01:24:31.166
She's so unlucky.

2297
01:24:31.166 --> 01:24:33.535
- We'll bet 11. - We are 1st.

2298
01:24:33.601 --> 01:24:36.271
In A is so unlucky.

2299
01:24:36.438 --> 01:24:38.506
She's unbelievable.

2300
01:24:39.808 --> 01:24:41.543
How does that happen?

2301
01:24:41.543 --> 01:24:43.244
- Let me switch seats. - She didn't succeed once.

2302
01:24:43.244 --> 01:24:45.914
It's because I'm next to Kwang Soo.

2303
01:24:45.914 --> 01:24:47.382
Why are you blaming it on me?

2304
01:24:47.382 --> 01:24:50.118
It starts over, so you don't have to bet 11.

2305
01:24:50.118 --> 01:24:52.687
- It starts over. - We'll bet six. Answer.

2306
01:24:52.954 --> 01:24:55.724
- In A, you're unbelievable. - She's so unlucky.

2307
01:24:55.724 --> 01:24:57.092
She's the female Kwang Soo.

2308
01:24:57.392 --> 01:24:59.361
She has to be on the unlucky special.

2309
01:25:00.929 --> 01:25:02.697
It always happens to her.

2310
01:25:03.932 --> 01:25:05.667
(Staring)

2311
01:25:07.335 --> 01:25:09.371
(Grabbing)

2312
01:25:10.305 --> 01:25:12.073
She transferred her energy.

2313
01:25:13.575 --> 01:25:15.477
She gave him a touch of bad luck.

2314
01:25:18.079 --> 01:25:20.014
Two negatives make a positive.

2315
01:25:20.181 --> 01:25:21.316
Bad luck plus bad luck is...

2316
01:25:22.784 --> 01:25:24.352
(Bad luck plus bad luck...)

2317
01:25:24.352 --> 01:25:26.654
(plus bad luck)

2318
01:25:26.654 --> 01:25:27.756
My goodness.

2319
01:25:27.756 --> 01:25:29.157
(I can't believe him.)

2320
01:25:29.457 --> 01:25:30.592
Then you have bad luck.

2321
01:25:31.459 --> 01:25:32.527
(Ha Ra tries to salvage the situation.)

2322
01:25:32.527 --> 01:25:33.595
Okay.

2323
01:25:34.295 --> 01:25:35.363
Please.

2324
01:25:35.363 --> 01:25:37.465
(The unlucky man, Jae Seok, begins to place his bet.)

2325
01:25:37.465 --> 01:25:38.466
The answer is one.

2326
01:25:38.466 --> 01:25:39.667
(She is sure about the answer.)

2327
01:25:39.667 --> 01:25:40.835
(Does Da Hee know the answer?)

2328
01:25:40.835 --> 01:25:43.872
Trotter didn't exist back then.

2329
01:25:43.872 --> 01:25:45.340
I know how the dish came to be.

2330
01:25:45.340 --> 01:25:46.341
Really?

2331
01:25:46.341 --> 01:25:48.009
Help me.

2332
01:25:48.209 --> 01:25:51.012
(Make sure no one finds out about this.)

2333
01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:52.947
My goodness.

2334
01:25:52.947 --> 01:25:54.048
(He succeeds in placing 6.)

2335
01:25:54.048 --> 01:25:55.250
Who knows the answer?

2336
01:25:55.250 --> 01:25:57.519
They inserted six knives.

2337
01:25:57.519 --> 01:25:58.953
- We will give it a go. - We will give it a go.

2338
01:25:58.953 --> 01:26:00.455
- Seven knives. - That's a lot.

2339
01:26:01.823 --> 01:26:03.091
Why aren't we going?

2340
01:26:03.091 --> 01:26:04.359
We should wait.

2341
01:26:04.359 --> 01:26:05.360
(Se Chan plans to watch the others as he is in 1st place.)

2342
01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:07.729
If the pirate pops up at our turn,

2343
01:26:07.729 --> 01:26:09.531
another team will win.

2344
01:26:09.697 --> 01:26:12.801
We don't need to take that risk.

2345
01:26:13.401 --> 01:26:15.703
Da Hee knows the answer to this question.

2346
01:26:15.703 --> 01:26:17.405
Da Hee knows the origin of every dish.

2347
01:26:17.405 --> 01:26:18.606
- Really? - Yes.

2348
01:26:18.973 --> 01:26:20.508
Not every dish.

2349
01:26:20.942 --> 01:26:23.545
The pirate will pop up.

2350
01:26:23.545 --> 01:26:24.612
Da Hee will make the pirate pop up.

2351
01:26:24.612 --> 01:26:26.347
They might fail.

2352
01:26:26.915 --> 01:26:29.717
Let's insert the knives together and share the responsibility.

2353
01:26:30.385 --> 01:26:31.519
- Okay. - That's a good idea.

2354
01:26:31.653 --> 01:26:32.887
(If that's what you want, I can oblige.)

2355
01:26:32.887 --> 01:26:33.988
All right.

2356
01:26:34.856 --> 01:26:36.691
Let's insert at the count of three.

2357
01:26:36.691 --> 01:26:37.892
In 1, 2, 3.

2358
01:26:37.892 --> 01:26:40.628
(Da Hee inserts hers, but Kwang Soo doesn't.)

2359
01:26:40.728 --> 01:26:42.297
In 1, 2, 3.

2360
01:26:42.464 --> 01:26:45.533
You are so mean. You are an utter jerk, aren't you?

2361
01:26:47.769 --> 01:26:51.339
(You are so mean. You are an utter jerk, aren't you?)

2362
01:26:51.339 --> 01:26:53.007
(An utter jerk)

2363
01:26:53.274 --> 01:26:55.877
(She calls him an utter jerk in a fit of anger.)

2364
01:26:55.877 --> 01:26:56.978
An utter jerk!

2365
01:26:57.745 --> 01:27:00.915
"You are so mean. You are an utter jerk, aren't you?"

2366
01:27:01.015 --> 01:27:02.750
Today,

2367
01:27:02.750 --> 01:27:06.488
Da Hee even made a popular phrase.

2368
01:27:06.988 --> 01:27:10.625
"You are so mean. You are an utter jerk, aren't you?"

2369
01:27:10.625 --> 01:27:12.727
I am sorry. I will insert my knife.

2370
01:27:13.795 --> 01:27:15.196
Go.

2371
01:27:15.363 --> 01:27:16.531
No, no.

2372
01:27:18.399 --> 01:27:19.968
Go.

2373
01:27:19.968 --> 01:27:21.102
No, no.

2374
01:27:24.072 --> 01:27:25.173
Okay!

2375
01:27:25.173 --> 01:27:26.741
(Kwang Soo and Da Hee succeed in betting 7 knives.)

2376
01:27:26.875 --> 01:27:28.610
Da Hee knows the origin of every dish.

2377
01:27:28.610 --> 01:27:29.978
No, I don't.

2378
01:27:29.978 --> 01:27:31.646
Jae Seok, are you going to bet more?

2379
01:27:31.646 --> 01:27:32.680
(13 out of 24 slots are filled.)

2380
01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:34.816
Jae Seok. Jae Seok. Are you going to bet more?

2381
01:27:34.816 --> 01:27:36.551
- That's a good idea. - Are you going to bet more?

2382
01:27:36.584 --> 01:27:38.152
- What? - Are you going to bet more?

2383
01:27:38.152 --> 01:27:40.355
- He is highly likely to fail. - Are you going to bet more?

2384
01:27:40.355 --> 01:27:41.422
Let me tell you this.

2385
01:27:41.422 --> 01:27:43.658
If we answer first, we will get the question right.

2386
01:27:43.758 --> 01:27:44.893
- Is that so? - Yes.

2387
01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:46.461
- Go. - Let's go.

2388
01:27:47.028 --> 01:27:48.162
Go.

2389
01:27:48.162 --> 01:27:49.797
- Let's go, Jae Seok. - Let's go.

2390
01:27:49.797 --> 01:27:51.966
Let's go. You know the answer.

2391
01:27:52.233 --> 01:27:53.668
The pirate might pop up.

2392
01:27:53.668 --> 01:27:54.903
It's okay. Let's go.

2393
01:27:55.637 --> 01:27:58.339
Ha Ra won't pick the wrong slot.

2394
01:27:59.340 --> 01:28:01.709
Ha Ra, go.

2395
01:28:03.011 --> 01:28:04.512
Ha Ra is sleeping.

2396
01:28:04.512 --> 01:28:05.813
I feel like she is inserting it in my stomach.

2397
01:28:05.813 --> 01:28:07.949
Hold on. For goodness' sake.

2398
01:28:07.949 --> 01:28:09.450
It's okay.

2399
01:28:09.450 --> 01:28:11.252
Didn't she sound like a middle-aged woman just now?

2400
01:28:11.252 --> 01:28:12.654
Hold on.

2401
01:28:13.154 --> 01:28:16.124
(Hold on, Pirate.)

2402
01:28:17.225 --> 01:28:18.626
Hold on.

2403
01:28:18.993 --> 01:28:20.995
(Ha Ra succeeds.)

2404
01:28:21.229 --> 01:28:23.798
Let's go, Kwang Soo.

2405
01:28:23.798 --> 01:28:25.567
There aren't a lot of open slots.

2406
01:28:26.100 --> 01:28:27.168
(While 9 slots remain,)

2407
01:28:27.168 --> 01:28:28.169
(Kwang Hee puts his faith in Da Hee and bets more.)

2408
01:28:28.169 --> 01:28:31.105
- We will bet more. - They are cool.

2409
01:28:31.172 --> 01:28:32.707
I hope it pops up.

2410
01:28:34.442 --> 01:28:35.843
Do you want to insert together?

2411
01:28:35.843 --> 01:28:36.978
- Okay. - Do you promise?

2412
01:28:38.413 --> 01:28:40.848
Insert the knife on my mark this time.

2413
01:28:40.848 --> 01:28:42.550
If they insert the knives together, they will share the responsibility.

2414
01:28:42.550 --> 01:28:44.085
That's why I suggested it.

2415
01:28:44.619 --> 01:28:47.555
- If we do this, we will win. - We can do this.

2416
01:28:47.655 --> 01:28:49.424
Insert it at the count of three.

2417
01:28:49.424 --> 01:28:51.659
- Okay. - In 1, 2, 3.

2418
01:28:51.659 --> 01:28:52.994
(Victory depends on the last question.)

2419
01:28:52.994 --> 01:28:54.295
(Since she claims to know the answer,)

2420
01:28:54.295 --> 01:28:56.431
(the tall ones decide to take a leap of faith.)

2421
01:28:56.431 --> 01:28:57.999
In 1, 2, 3.

2422
01:28:58.633 --> 01:29:01.402
- I can't believe you! - No, no.

2423
01:29:01.402 --> 01:29:03.071
(Kwang Soo's hand doesn't move.)

2424
01:29:03.071 --> 01:29:06.908
I missed my cue. I missed my cue.

2425
01:29:06.908 --> 01:29:07.976
Hey,

2426
01:29:07.976 --> 01:29:10.945
how could you miss the cue when I counted to three?

2427
01:29:10.945 --> 01:29:13.414
It happened too quickly.

2428
01:29:13.414 --> 01:29:16.851
Had you said it slowly, I would've done it correctly.

2429
01:29:16.851 --> 01:29:20.021
She is so cute. My goodness.

2430
01:29:20.021 --> 01:29:22.323
In 1, 2, 3. Then you insert.

2431
01:29:22.323 --> 01:29:24.826
You should have said it slowly.

2432
01:29:24.826 --> 01:29:26.728
- You went, "In 1, 2, 3." - You are an utter jerk.

2433
01:29:26.728 --> 01:29:28.162
- It happened too quickly. - You are an utter jerk.

2434
01:29:28.162 --> 01:29:29.864
Hurry up, and insert the knife. I will watch you.

2435
01:29:29.864 --> 01:29:31.232
I didn't pick the bad slot.

2436
01:29:31.633 --> 01:29:33.501
- I didn't pick the bad slot. - This is driving me crazy.

2437
01:29:33.968 --> 01:29:36.137
(A big shadow watches the utter jerk.)

2438
01:29:36.137 --> 01:29:37.238
It will pop up.

2439
01:29:37.472 --> 01:29:38.539
It will pop up.

2440
01:29:38.539 --> 01:29:39.607
(Serious)

2441
01:29:39.607 --> 01:29:43.244
Kwang Soo, I will be really angry if you make it pop up.

2442
01:29:43.244 --> 01:29:45.079
She will be through with you.

2443
01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:47.649
Da Hee knows the answer.

2444
01:29:47.649 --> 01:29:48.650
(Kwang Soo meets the biggest crisis.)

2445
01:29:48.650 --> 01:29:50.418
(What is his fate?)

2446
01:29:50.418 --> 01:29:51.786
(Next week)

2447
01:29:52.020 --> 01:29:54.322
(The unlucky ones strike.)

2448
01:29:54.322 --> 01:29:57.458
(This is the curse of pirate roulette game.)

2449
01:29:57.659 --> 01:30:00.128
(What will become of the fire moth couple?)

2450
01:30:00.595 --> 01:30:02.463
(The 2nd Jeju Island Special, Hopscotch Race)

2451
01:30:02.797 --> 01:30:05.967
(Jae Seok's team and Seok Jin's team have a face-off.)

2452
01:30:05.967 --> 01:30:08.803
(Who will take the attractions of Jeju Island?)

2453
01:30:08.803 --> 01:30:11.839
(They are serious.)

2454
01:30:11.839 --> 01:30:15.009
(This piece of land is ours.)

2455
01:30:15.410 --> 01:30:17.178
(We can't let you have it.)

2456
01:30:17.178 --> 01:30:19.313
(They have a scramble to take more land in Jeju Island.)

2457
01:30:19.313 --> 01:30:21.249
(Is there a traitor in the team?)

2458
01:30:21.616 --> 01:30:24.285
(The sly traitors aim to sell the land,)

2459
01:30:24.285 --> 01:30:26.721
(and the loyal strategists aim to defend the land.)

2460
01:30:27.588 --> 01:30:30.958
(Who will come out on top in this dirty fight?)

2461
01:30:30.958 --> 01:30:32.427
All of us will fall to the pit today.
