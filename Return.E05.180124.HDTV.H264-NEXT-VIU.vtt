00:00:05.658 --> 00:00:07.287
- Previously on Return. - Are you kidding me?

2
00:00:07.457 --> 00:00:10.258
You are under arrest for murdering and abandoning the body of Ms. Yum.

3
00:00:10.258 --> 00:00:11.457
Ja Hye. I need your help.

4
00:00:11.457 --> 00:00:14.867
With whom were you at the penthouse on December 3?

5
00:00:14.867 --> 00:00:17.838
The murderer refrigerated the entire body?

6
00:00:17.838 --> 00:00:19.408
It would be possible if it were somewhere like a hospital?

7
00:00:19.438 --> 00:00:22.208
This afternoon, In Ho's lawyer came by and asked about that day.

8
00:00:25.338 --> 00:00:27.107
(Episode 5)

9
00:00:32.077 --> 00:00:33.318
1, 2, 3.

10
00:00:50.098 --> 00:00:51.098
Hey.

11
00:00:55.607 --> 00:00:58.138
Oh Tae Suk, you're unbelievable.

12
00:00:58.378 --> 00:01:00.407
Move aside. At this rate, we won't be done tonight.

13
00:01:08.617 --> 00:01:12.018
Hey, this brings back old memories, doesn't it?

14
00:01:12.018 --> 00:01:14.557
That time when we got together just like this and...

15
00:01:14.557 --> 00:01:15.727
Just keep digging.

16
00:01:19.298 --> 00:01:22.328
Look at that jerk. He's so sensitive. My goodness.

17
00:01:27.667 --> 00:01:28.708
Gosh, my back.

18
00:01:43.557 --> 00:01:44.587
I'm beat.

19
00:01:47.658 --> 00:01:48.958
Hey, what are you doing?

20
00:02:00.637 --> 00:02:01.738
Mi Jung...

21
00:02:03.807 --> 00:02:04.807
is pretty.

22
00:02:06.647 --> 00:02:07.847
You crazy jerk.

23
00:02:08.377 --> 00:02:10.777
- She was my first love... - Stop acting crazy.

24
00:02:13.647 --> 00:02:15.217
You're such a jerk.

25
00:02:35.738 --> 00:02:38.238
(55 hours before the discovery of Yum Mi Jung's body)

26
00:02:47.048 --> 00:02:49.217
(Two days before the discovery of Yum Mi Jung's body)

27
00:02:51.018 --> 00:02:52.988
Come on. Stop picking at your food.

28
00:02:53.288 --> 00:02:55.488
You must eat your meal to work.

29
00:02:56.258 --> 00:02:57.298
I lost my appetite.

30
00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.897
You're a doctor, but you look weaker than your patients.

31
00:03:00.298 --> 00:03:02.467
Shouldn't you be lying on a bed among your patients?

32
00:03:05.467 --> 00:03:06.467
(Tae Suk)

33
00:03:11.907 --> 00:03:14.078
Hello, my dear friend, Oh Tae Suk.

34
00:03:14.907 --> 00:03:17.018
When are you going to give me the 36th Young Sook?

35
00:03:17.317 --> 00:03:20.717
We are friends. It was just a game.

36
00:03:21.388 --> 00:03:24.057
You're not seriously going to take my Young Sook, right?

37
00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.858
You can't go back on your word.

38
00:03:28.187 --> 00:03:31.997
I am very much looking forward to spending a sizzling night...

39
00:03:32.668 --> 00:03:33.798
with Young Sook today.

40
00:03:35.198 --> 00:03:36.738
Hey... Hey!

41
00:03:38.798 --> 00:03:41.907
Hey, he's such a head case, isn't he?

42
00:03:41.907 --> 00:03:43.777
At least pretend that you're complying.

43
00:03:44.238 --> 00:03:46.448
You know that once Tae Suk makes up his mind,

44
00:03:46.448 --> 00:03:48.247
he always makes sure he follows through.

45
00:03:48.247 --> 00:03:50.117
But Young Sook is...

46
00:03:53.147 --> 00:03:56.018
I just can't let give her to him myself. I'm serious.

47
00:03:57.817 --> 00:03:58.817
Drop her off...

48
00:04:00.458 --> 00:04:01.828
at the penthouse for me.

49
00:04:02.527 --> 00:04:03.557
Today?

50
00:04:10.268 --> 00:04:11.798
I'm on my way to hand you over Young Sook.

51
00:04:12.337 --> 00:04:14.407
Hak Bum said he just couldn't drop her off by himself.

52
00:04:19.877 --> 00:04:21.278
She's in the garage.

53
00:04:21.678 --> 00:04:24.817
He says he just can't give her to you. What did she do to him?

54
00:04:25.178 --> 00:04:26.348
Be careful.

55
00:04:53.247 --> 00:04:57.117
That punk. He said he couldn't just give her to me. He messed with her.

56
00:05:19.968 --> 00:05:20.968
What is it?

57
00:05:22.507 --> 00:05:24.577
What is it, sir? What's wrong?

58
00:05:25.038 --> 00:05:27.848
I fell. You may get back to work.

59
00:05:27.848 --> 00:05:29.517
You don't look well.

60
00:05:29.517 --> 00:05:31.548
Should I call an ambulance? Or do you need help walking...

61
00:05:31.548 --> 00:05:34.387
I told you to get back to work, okay?

62
00:05:35.788 --> 00:05:37.517
Yes, sir. I'll do that.

63
00:05:59.348 --> 00:06:00.478
What...

64
00:06:15.228 --> 00:06:17.298
Where did they go...

65
00:06:18.257 --> 00:06:20.367
after dropping a bomb on me?

66
00:06:20.898 --> 00:06:21.898
We're here.

67
00:06:28.968 --> 00:06:30.637
Seriously.

68
00:06:32.678 --> 00:06:34.507
What was that crazy talk?

69
00:06:44.387 --> 00:06:46.288
Don't do that!

70
00:06:47.288 --> 00:06:48.528
Seriously.

71
00:06:49.358 --> 00:06:50.398
Shoot.

72
00:06:53.298 --> 00:06:54.298
Mi Jung?

73
00:07:23.997 --> 00:07:25.028
What...

74
00:07:26.398 --> 00:07:28.028
- Who did this? - You,

75
00:07:36.707 --> 00:07:37.978
Joon Hee, or me.

76
00:07:39.178 --> 00:07:41.077
Drop the gibberish.

77
00:07:42.307 --> 00:07:44.648
What's going on?

78
00:07:44.817 --> 00:07:47.317
What did you mean by saying you couldn't just give me the car?

79
00:07:57.457 --> 00:08:00.668
I was just fooling around!

80
00:08:02.327 --> 00:08:03.437
So it wasn't you?

81
00:08:03.437 --> 00:08:05.968
Hey. You moved the car.

82
00:08:05.968 --> 00:08:09.637
You told me to! All I did was drive.

83
00:08:12.278 --> 00:08:13.807
Hey, first...

84
00:08:14.848 --> 00:08:16.117
Let's close this first.

85
00:08:29.428 --> 00:08:30.658
Hey, hold her straight.

86
00:08:33.498 --> 00:08:34.868
I'm tired.

87
00:08:35.128 --> 00:08:37.467
Hey, let's switch.

88
00:08:37.467 --> 00:08:39.437
Hey, do you think you're the only one who's tired?

89
00:08:40.837 --> 00:08:43.278
I think we should call the police at least now and...

90
00:08:43.278 --> 00:08:44.477
Shut it.

91
00:08:44.908 --> 00:08:46.548
If you aren't going to help, at least shut it.

92
00:08:47.847 --> 00:08:49.107
Hey, let's hurry up and go.

93
00:08:51.577 --> 00:08:54.217
But why are we taking the stairs?

94
00:08:54.217 --> 00:08:55.487
Why can't we take the elevator?

95
00:08:56.057 --> 00:08:57.087
Are you a moron?

96
00:08:57.388 --> 00:08:59.758
Do you want to get caught on camera?

97
00:09:01.888 --> 00:09:05.197
Once we get to the penthouse, what next?

98
00:09:05.197 --> 00:09:06.727
What do you plan to do next?

99
00:09:06.727 --> 00:09:08.768
Move her first. We can think later.

100
00:09:12.097 --> 00:09:13.408
Hey!

101
00:09:17.908 --> 00:09:19.077
Are you okay?

102
00:09:23.118 --> 00:09:26.347
Hey. You should've held on. You shouldn't roll down with her.

103
00:09:26.347 --> 00:09:28.317
Are you... Are you insane?

104
00:09:28.788 --> 00:09:31.087
How could you just let go like that?

105
00:09:34.727 --> 00:09:36.827
Mi Jung is dead, right?

106
00:09:37.357 --> 00:09:39.428
She can't feel pain. No, she can't.

107
00:09:39.428 --> 00:09:42.298
But... What about me?

108
00:09:44.038 --> 00:09:45.197
You freak.

109
00:09:51.678 --> 00:09:53.908
You said no one takes the stairs.

110
00:10:03.957 --> 00:10:05.357
Is someone there?

111
00:10:09.197 --> 00:10:10.258
My apologies.

112
00:10:26.378 --> 00:10:29.148
- You freak. - You look like a bigger freak.

113
00:10:48.197 --> 00:10:49.798
Let's call the police at least now.

114
00:10:49.798 --> 00:10:53.138
Sit still! Let's think about this a little more.

115
00:10:53.138 --> 00:10:54.768
We can always call later.

116
00:10:57.538 --> 00:10:58.837
Shoot.

117
00:11:00.447 --> 00:11:02.107
Who did that?

118
00:11:04.248 --> 00:11:06.288
You really don't know what happened to her?

119
00:11:06.487 --> 00:11:07.648
What are you talking about?

120
00:11:07.788 --> 00:11:10.487
You always talked about teaching her a lesson...

121
00:11:10.487 --> 00:11:11.987
for disrespecting you.

122
00:11:12.658 --> 00:11:14.028
You crazy jerk.

123
00:11:15.057 --> 00:11:16.957
I was saying it out of anger.

124
00:11:16.957 --> 00:11:20.067
It wasn't just once. You said it all the time!

125
00:11:21.097 --> 00:11:23.498
Hey. What's your deal?

126
00:11:24.168 --> 00:11:27.538
Are you trying to dump this all on me?

127
00:11:27.707 --> 00:11:30.807
You said you couldn't just give me the car as it is.

128
00:11:30.807 --> 00:11:35.248
I prepared a little prank. I told you that already!

129
00:11:36.748 --> 00:11:38.048
To be honest,

130
00:11:39.048 --> 00:11:42.048
you're the one who really wanted to kill Mi Jung.

131
00:11:42.048 --> 00:11:44.087
What? Why would I?

132
00:11:44.087 --> 00:11:46.628
She always asked your family for money.

133
00:11:48.187 --> 00:11:49.197
What do you think you know?

134
00:11:51.557 --> 00:11:53.067
I know a lot.

135
00:11:54.028 --> 00:11:56.768
Her wine bar in Cheongdam-dong.

136
00:11:57.298 --> 00:11:58.967
Your dad gave her that.

137
00:12:02.807 --> 00:12:04.038
Why was that?

138
00:12:04.638 --> 00:12:08.648
What did she have on both of you, father and son?

139
00:12:08.648 --> 00:12:09.648
You crazy jerk.

140
00:12:11.248 --> 00:12:13.788
Fine! Let's call the cops and find out...

141
00:12:13.788 --> 00:12:16.288
who did that to Mi Jung.

142
00:12:16.587 --> 00:12:17.717
You crazy jerks.

143
00:12:18.717 --> 00:12:20.087
Go ahead.

144
00:12:20.928 --> 00:12:22.428
If you call now,

145
00:12:22.697 --> 00:12:26.067
all three of us will be suspects.

146
00:12:26.298 --> 00:12:27.798
I like that.

147
00:12:27.898 --> 00:12:31.498
Let's all play in the mud together.

148
00:12:31.498 --> 00:12:33.237
Why is it all three of us?

149
00:12:33.368 --> 00:12:35.307
Take me out of it. I had no problems with her.

150
00:12:35.307 --> 00:12:37.837
To be honest, you're not free either.

151
00:12:38.477 --> 00:12:40.947
Hey. Mi Jung is the one...

152
00:12:40.947 --> 00:12:42.778
who supplied his drugs.

153
00:12:42.977 --> 00:12:44.748
It's been about five years now.

154
00:12:53.528 --> 00:12:55.457
(Oh Tae Suk)

155
00:12:58.827 --> 00:13:01.128
Give it to me while I'm being nice.

156
00:13:03.097 --> 00:13:04.798
If this video gets out,

157
00:13:06.067 --> 00:13:08.508
it'll hurt your reputation a little.

158
00:13:09.837 --> 00:13:10.837
Here.

159
00:13:13.648 --> 00:13:14.678
Take it.

160
00:13:16.648 --> 00:13:20.518
Her dad was a chauffeur.

161
00:13:20.888 --> 00:13:22.857
So if you girls succeed too,

162
00:13:22.857 --> 00:13:25.788
you can become like this chauffeur's daughter here.

163
00:13:25.888 --> 00:13:28.227
That's why you should work hard.

164
00:13:28.687 --> 00:13:32.097
Gosh. This place is nice.

165
00:13:37.368 --> 00:13:39.707
All you have going for you...

166
00:13:41.008 --> 00:13:43.307
other than your family's money is your big mouth.

167
00:13:43.508 --> 00:13:44.538
Were you talking to me?

168
00:13:44.878 --> 00:13:46.977
What? Hey.

169
00:13:51.418 --> 00:13:52.418
Hey!

170
00:13:54.048 --> 00:13:55.918
I'll kill you.

171
00:13:56.918 --> 00:13:58.018
Psycho.

172
00:14:00.957 --> 00:14:04.097
Is something wrong, Joon Hee?

173
00:14:05.028 --> 00:14:06.128
Is something wrong?

174
00:14:08.168 --> 00:14:09.967
"Something wrong"?

175
00:14:20.148 --> 00:14:21.148
Drink it.

176
00:14:21.408 --> 00:14:22.508
If you drink it,

177
00:14:23.678 --> 00:14:25.317
you will feel much more peaceful.

178
00:14:40.428 --> 00:14:41.467
Hey, guys.

179
00:14:43.067 --> 00:14:44.268
Let's not do this to each other.

180
00:14:45.697 --> 00:14:48.138
If we report this to the police, they might find out who did this,

181
00:14:49.778 --> 00:14:52.778
but all of us will be in a pickle if this traces back to us.

182
00:14:53.148 --> 00:14:54.748
You don't want to be implicated in this, right?

183
00:14:54.748 --> 00:14:57.077
My gosh, then what do you suggest that we do?

184
00:14:58.878 --> 00:15:00.288
Shoot.

185
00:15:01.648 --> 00:15:03.217
It's not like...

186
00:15:04.418 --> 00:15:06.227
we can just bury her in an isolated place.

187
00:15:11.428 --> 00:15:12.457
Should we...

188
00:15:14.268 --> 00:15:15.268
really bury her?

189
00:15:17.467 --> 00:15:19.967
Think about it. I saw it in the movies.

190
00:15:20.538 --> 00:15:21.668
When there's no corpse,

191
00:15:22.268 --> 00:15:24.378
there's no evidence of murder,

192
00:15:25.138 --> 00:15:26.807
so they cannot charge the murder with the crime.

193
00:15:26.908 --> 00:15:29.378
But we didn't murder her. We don't need to go that far.

194
00:15:29.378 --> 00:15:30.378
No.

195
00:15:31.077 --> 00:15:32.077
This makes sense.

196
00:15:35.447 --> 00:15:37.758
As long as we bury her somewhere she will never be found.

197
00:15:38.087 --> 00:15:40.487
But does such place exist?

198
00:15:42.428 --> 00:15:43.457
There's one.

199
00:15:44.258 --> 00:15:47.928
There's an old quarry our family bought in Gangwon Province.

200
00:15:48.467 --> 00:15:49.998
We don't plan on developing the property for the time being.

201
00:15:50.237 --> 00:15:51.538
And since it's uninhabited,

202
00:15:52.337 --> 00:15:53.837
it will be completely safe.

203
00:15:54.707 --> 00:15:58.138
Okay. Hey, In Ho keeps...

204
00:15:58.437 --> 00:16:01.447
a big suitcase in the closet.

205
00:16:02.408 --> 00:16:03.418
Let me bring it.

206
00:16:03.817 --> 00:16:04.817
Hey.

207
00:16:09.087 --> 00:16:10.087
Problem solved.

208
00:16:11.111 --> 00:16:16.111
<font color="#fcc89b">[VIU Ver] E05 Return "Why Are You Avoiding Me?"</font>
<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

209
00:16:17.258 --> 00:16:18.258
Hey.

210
00:16:20.368 --> 00:16:21.368
This is huge.

211
00:16:24.398 --> 00:16:25.668
Even all of us could fit into it.

212
00:16:27.807 --> 00:16:30.607
(A week after the discovery of the corpse)

213
00:16:34.678 --> 00:16:35.678
Joon Hee.

214
00:16:40.648 --> 00:16:41.687
Joon Hee.

215
00:16:45.687 --> 00:16:46.727
Joon Hee.

216
00:16:48.487 --> 00:16:49.658
Why are you avoiding me?

217
00:16:53.868 --> 00:16:57.168
I'm not avoiding you. I just remembered a pressing matter.

218
00:16:57.168 --> 00:16:58.998
Can you spare me some time?

219
00:17:03.378 --> 00:17:05.578
The girl in the back of the photo.

220
00:17:07.277 --> 00:17:08.308
It's Mi Jung, right?

221
00:17:11.678 --> 00:17:14.187
All of you had known her for a long time.

222
00:17:17.658 --> 00:17:19.358
Despite your long friendship,

223
00:17:21.628 --> 00:17:23.797
you guys pretended to have met for the first time that day.

224
00:17:25.227 --> 00:17:26.227
I'm sorry.

225
00:17:29.767 --> 00:17:31.868
Okay. That day,

226
00:17:33.338 --> 00:17:35.368
everyone seemed different.

227
00:17:37.578 --> 00:17:38.808
Only I didn't see that.

228
00:17:40.507 --> 00:17:43.348
Na Ra, you are a great cook too.

229
00:17:44.477 --> 00:17:45.947
This is cheating.

230
00:17:46.787 --> 00:17:50.187
You're pretty, smart, and good-natured.

231
00:17:52.088 --> 00:17:53.588
I'm slightly offended now.

232
00:17:56.757 --> 00:18:00.797
Na Ra, what other ingredients did you put in the salad dressing...

233
00:18:00.797 --> 00:18:02.638
except kiwis?

234
00:18:03.668 --> 00:18:06.068
I put kiwis in that one and balsamic vinegar for this one.

235
00:18:08.138 --> 00:18:10.308
- They are to die for. - Thank you.

236
00:18:11.638 --> 00:18:14.578
Joon Hee, try the salad with balsamic vinegar.

237
00:18:15.178 --> 00:18:16.217
All right.

238
00:18:17.348 --> 00:18:19.787
I didn't remember it that day,

239
00:18:19.787 --> 00:18:22.517
but I remembered that you were allergic to kiwi later on.

240
00:18:23.918 --> 00:18:26.487
The fact that she knew that you had a kiwi allergy...

241
00:18:28.428 --> 00:18:30.128
means that you must have been close.

242
00:18:33.428 --> 00:18:34.467
Tell me.

243
00:18:36.638 --> 00:18:38.398
Tell me the story between all of you that only I don't know.

244
00:18:43.078 --> 00:18:44.078
Mi Jung...

245
00:18:47.878 --> 00:18:49.818
and we had known each other since we were 14.

246
00:18:51.678 --> 00:18:52.918
Since you were 14?

247
00:18:53.447 --> 00:18:55.247
She was the daughter of Tae Suk's driver, Mr. Yum,

248
00:18:55.957 --> 00:18:57.257
who lived with his family.

249
00:18:58.687 --> 00:19:01.358
(1998)

250
00:19:02.957 --> 00:19:04.558
She was 19 back then.

251
00:19:05.598 --> 00:19:06.598
She was pretty...

252
00:19:07.898 --> 00:19:09.168
and maturer than her age.

253
00:19:11.267 --> 00:19:14.338
- Who is that? - She's really pretty.

254
00:19:14.808 --> 00:19:16.808
- She can see us. - Hey, you jerk.

255
00:19:19.408 --> 00:19:21.908
Quit peeking at me, and just come out here.

256
00:19:23.378 --> 00:19:25.848
I will give whoever comes out here first...

257
00:19:26.187 --> 00:19:29.047
the honor of touching my feet.

258
00:19:29.987 --> 00:19:31.618
Hey, you should get out there.

259
00:19:34.257 --> 00:19:35.588
You must be Tae Suk's friend.

260
00:19:35.628 --> 00:19:38.297
Well, Hak Bum just pushed me.

261
00:19:39.027 --> 00:19:40.267
What's your name?

262
00:19:40.967 --> 00:19:42.937
I... I'm Seo Joon Hee.

263
00:19:43.467 --> 00:19:44.868
Hak Bum, you should come out too.

264
00:19:45.267 --> 00:19:46.267
Okay.

265
00:19:50.277 --> 00:19:51.808
Who else is hiding there?

266
00:19:52.078 --> 00:19:53.108
It's In Ho.

267
00:19:54.348 --> 00:19:57.078
In Ho, I caught you too.

268
00:20:11.328 --> 00:20:13.898
When we were young, we all liked her except In Ho.

269
00:20:15.497 --> 00:20:16.797
He was the only one who wasn't interested in her.

270
00:20:17.267 --> 00:20:18.267
He wasn't interested...

271
00:20:18.267 --> 00:20:20.068
But he was the one who dated her.

272
00:20:23.977 --> 00:20:25.078
When we turned 20,

273
00:20:25.977 --> 00:20:28.047
we found out that they were dating.

274
00:20:32.547 --> 00:20:35.517
They had been seeing each other since they were 20 until now?

275
00:20:35.648 --> 00:20:36.658
No.

276
00:20:36.987 --> 00:20:38.888
They broke up after he met you.

277
00:20:38.888 --> 00:20:41.487
Their relationship was rekindled only recently. It's true.

278
00:20:44.027 --> 00:20:46.668
I believe you. You are not good at lying.

279
00:20:49.437 --> 00:20:51.497
Then let me rephrase my question.

280
00:20:52.868 --> 00:20:53.868
Do you think...

281
00:20:55.037 --> 00:20:56.808
In Ho murdered Mi Jung?

282
00:21:58.497 --> 00:22:01.937
When we turned 20, we found out that they were dating.

283
00:22:02.168 --> 00:22:05.178
They had been seeing each other since they were 20 until now?

284
00:22:05.178 --> 00:22:07.078
They broke up after he met you.

285
00:22:07.078 --> 00:22:09.747
Their relationship was rekindled only recently. It's true.

286
00:22:24.027 --> 00:22:25.967
- Mom! - Mom!

287
00:22:25.967 --> 00:22:28.898
- Mommy! - Mom!

288
00:22:29.997 --> 00:22:31.068
Is that really you, Mom?

289
00:22:31.497 --> 00:22:32.808
- Goodbye. - What?

290
00:22:33.638 --> 00:22:35.338
Of course I am.

291
00:22:35.668 --> 00:22:38.908
But why do you look so pretty today?

292
00:22:39.178 --> 00:22:41.207
I wanted to look nice for my princess.

293
00:22:42.477 --> 00:22:43.678
Why? Do I look weird?

294
00:22:43.678 --> 00:22:46.787
No, you look like a pretty lady on TV.

295
00:22:48.487 --> 00:22:50.987
Then I will make sure I look pretty from now on.

296
00:22:51.058 --> 00:22:52.088
Okay.

297
00:23:24.358 --> 00:23:26.027
I had a dream a few days ago.

298
00:23:29.158 --> 00:23:31.658
When you had a day off, you'd turn off the alarms...

299
00:23:32.128 --> 00:23:33.398
since you were afraid to wake me up.

300
00:23:35.168 --> 00:23:36.868
You'd help Dal Rae wash up.

301
00:23:39.568 --> 00:23:41.108
You'd make toasts.

302
00:23:41.638 --> 00:23:43.678
- That's hot. - You'd even brew coffee too.

303
00:23:45.037 --> 00:23:47.808
I would wake up after sleeping in.

304
00:23:52.687 --> 00:23:55.318
That familiar memory was in my dream.

305
00:24:01.158 --> 00:24:04.058
I would have forgotten about it under any other circumstances.

306
00:24:10.467 --> 00:24:12.098
But it broke my heart to pieces.

307
00:24:19.178 --> 00:24:21.277
I guess days like this with you...

308
00:24:21.747 --> 00:24:23.717
will be no more.

309
00:24:24.348 --> 00:24:26.818
Wait. Hey.

310
00:24:27.987 --> 00:24:29.318
No, Na Ra.

311
00:24:29.818 --> 00:24:33.128
We... We can live like that again.

312
00:24:33.787 --> 00:24:35.187
How is that possible?

313
00:24:38.828 --> 00:24:40.898
How can we live as we did before?

314
00:24:41.828 --> 00:24:45.467
I'm telling the truth. I didn't kill Mi Jung.

315
00:24:50.537 --> 00:24:51.707
Do you know something?

316
00:24:54.707 --> 00:24:57.348
The fact that you were accused of murder...

317
00:24:58.348 --> 00:25:00.017
isn't shocking to me.

318
00:25:01.447 --> 00:25:02.487
Why?

319
00:25:04.588 --> 00:25:07.187
Because I don't think you killed a person.

320
00:25:08.257 --> 00:25:10.697
Because I believe that much about you.

321
00:25:12.628 --> 00:25:16.497
But the fact that you embraced another woman,

322
00:25:19.568 --> 00:25:22.638
pulled her into the neighborhood where Dal Rae and I live,

323
00:25:23.178 --> 00:25:24.878
and sat her at my table...

324
00:25:27.707 --> 00:25:28.848
is something I can't forgive.

325
00:25:30.678 --> 00:25:31.747
Na Ra.

326
00:25:31.747 --> 00:25:34.888
First, I'll clear your name of murder.

327
00:25:35.787 --> 00:25:37.618
You're Dal Rae's dad.

328
00:25:38.618 --> 00:25:40.888
I can't let her be a murderer's daughter.

329
00:25:42.287 --> 00:25:45.628
Then I'll decide about our relationship...

330
00:25:47.568 --> 00:25:49.068
later on.

331
00:25:49.697 --> 00:25:51.338
Na Ra, please.

332
00:25:51.338 --> 00:25:52.967
Do you think...

333
00:25:55.108 --> 00:25:57.908
murder would hurt me more than your cheating?

334
00:26:00.648 --> 00:26:01.808
That's your arrogance.

335
00:26:08.787 --> 00:26:09.787
Na Ra...

336
00:26:22.997 --> 00:26:26.068
You should know that I can't tell you...

337
00:26:26.068 --> 00:26:27.537
about the case.

338
00:26:28.138 --> 00:26:29.338
Of course.

339
00:26:29.608 --> 00:26:31.777
You seem different today.

340
00:26:32.308 --> 00:26:34.277
You're wearing heavy makeup.

341
00:26:35.747 --> 00:26:37.378
You're wearing heels too.

342
00:26:38.447 --> 00:26:40.217
You look prettier today.

343
00:26:40.717 --> 00:26:43.558
- Do I look like an attorney? - By any chance,

344
00:26:44.957 --> 00:26:46.287
did you make your decision?

345
00:26:48.227 --> 00:26:49.457
Will you accept me?

346
00:26:50.658 --> 00:26:51.757
Of course.

347
00:26:54.128 --> 00:26:58.568
Please show me Kang In Ho's file now, Ms. Choi.

348
00:27:03.108 --> 00:27:05.608
- Here you go. - Thank you.

349
00:27:07.947 --> 00:27:09.378
(Autopsy Report)

350
00:27:09.378 --> 00:27:12.418
(Yum Mi Jung, 38)

351
00:27:16.118 --> 00:27:18.118
(DNA Test Result)

352
00:27:18.118 --> 00:27:21.428
(Skin beneath deceased's nail, DNA sample from Kang In Ho)

353
00:27:25.297 --> 00:27:27.227
(Prince Hotel)

354
00:27:27.227 --> 00:27:29.937
(November 10, 2017, Yum Mi Jung checked in at Prince Hotel)

355
00:27:38.207 --> 00:27:41.148
(Q: What is your relationship with Yum Mi Jung?)

356
00:27:42.947 --> 00:27:44.918
(A:We are just friends.)

357
00:27:44.918 --> 00:27:46.918
(Q:Does your wife know about Yum Mi Jung?)

358
00:27:59.668 --> 00:28:00.668
Doctor.

359
00:28:02.737 --> 00:28:03.797
- Doctor. - What?

360
00:28:04.197 --> 00:28:05.267
Oh, hello.

361
00:28:05.368 --> 00:28:08.138
- What were you thinking about? - Well...

362
00:28:09.338 --> 00:28:11.007
Someone's waiting for you at the cafe.

363
00:28:33.267 --> 00:28:34.727
Dr. Seo Joon Hee?

364
00:28:40.168 --> 00:28:41.668
What is this about?

365
00:28:42.908 --> 00:28:44.908
About Kang In Ho, of course.

366
00:28:45.138 --> 00:28:49.217
I heard the four of you were always together since childhood.

367
00:28:49.678 --> 00:28:50.747
Did In Ho say that?

368
00:28:50.747 --> 00:28:52.848
Yes, he said you're like brothers.

369
00:28:54.247 --> 00:28:56.658
Oh, this was from Oh Tae Suk.

370
00:28:57.418 --> 00:28:58.757
We are like brothers.

371
00:28:59.257 --> 00:29:02.388
I heard the four of you shared the penthouse equally...

372
00:29:02.388 --> 00:29:04.898
along with Kang In Ho.

373
00:29:05.428 --> 00:29:07.497
- Yes. - Did you go there...

374
00:29:09.027 --> 00:29:10.967
on December 3?

375
00:29:13.267 --> 00:29:16.408
Joon Hee. This is your chance to tell the truth.

376
00:29:17.078 --> 00:29:19.037
Tell the truth and ask her to find the killer.

377
00:29:19.578 --> 00:29:20.848
You crazy freak.

378
00:29:21.277 --> 00:29:23.447
You put the body in a limited edition luggage?

379
00:29:23.447 --> 00:29:24.678
You crazy freak.

380
00:29:24.947 --> 00:29:27.848
You're the one who said there was no one on that mountain.

381
00:29:28.517 --> 00:29:30.187
What's the use in fighting among ourselves?

382
00:29:30.187 --> 00:29:32.558
Hey. What do we do about In Ho?

383
00:29:32.558 --> 00:29:33.588
Because of us...

384
00:29:33.588 --> 00:29:35.787
In Ho may have done it.

385
00:29:35.787 --> 00:29:38.558
He has the strongest motive among us all.

386
00:29:38.558 --> 00:29:40.928
That's insane, you crazy jerk!

387
00:29:41.497 --> 00:29:42.668
What now?

388
00:29:42.997 --> 00:29:44.997
This wouldn't have happened if we had reported it then.

389
00:29:44.997 --> 00:29:47.237
It's too late to turn back!

390
00:29:49.168 --> 00:29:52.078
But seriously, what will we do about In Ho?

391
00:29:52.547 --> 00:29:53.578
He's our friend.

392
00:29:53.578 --> 00:29:56.477
We chose the lesser of two evils instead of the worst.

393
00:29:57.547 --> 00:30:00.088
You really want to leave him there?

394
00:30:00.088 --> 00:30:02.017
They have the top lawyers on it.

395
00:30:02.017 --> 00:30:03.757
They'll get him out easily.

396
00:30:03.957 --> 00:30:04.987
Tae Suk.

397
00:30:05.787 --> 00:30:07.058
This is murder.

398
00:30:07.457 --> 00:30:09.457
It's different from anything else!

399
00:30:09.957 --> 00:30:14.098
Hey. Hey. If he's innocent, he'll be found not guilty.

400
00:30:17.267 --> 00:30:19.168
No. I can't do that.

401
00:30:21.207 --> 00:30:23.537
I'll tell the police everything.

402
00:30:24.308 --> 00:30:26.378
- You crazy jerks. - Joon.

403
00:30:27.547 --> 00:30:28.578
Your dad doesn't know...

404
00:30:29.977 --> 00:30:31.578
that you're on drugs, does he?

405
00:30:35.187 --> 00:30:37.517
He values reputation more than skill.

406
00:30:40.558 --> 00:30:41.787
How will your dad...

407
00:30:42.957 --> 00:30:44.828
handle that disgrace?

408
00:30:48.328 --> 00:30:49.497
Dr. Seo.

409
00:30:51.797 --> 00:30:54.767
No. I haven't been to the penthouse recently.

410
00:30:55.267 --> 00:30:56.308
I see.

411
00:30:56.838 --> 00:30:59.507
I'm sorry for bugging you for nothing.

412
00:30:59.507 --> 00:31:00.977
I thought it would be rude...

413
00:31:00.977 --> 00:31:03.947
to ask over the phone when we've never met.

414
00:31:03.947 --> 00:31:05.678
I hope I didn't make you uncomfortable.

415
00:31:05.678 --> 00:31:08.217
No. I'm busy now, so...

416
00:31:08.418 --> 00:31:09.618
Okay.

417
00:31:10.717 --> 00:31:13.227
My coffee is still warm,

418
00:31:13.757 --> 00:31:15.997
so I'll finish drinking it and then go.

419
00:31:16.297 --> 00:31:17.358
Okay.

420
00:31:18.328 --> 00:31:19.668
Dr. Seo.

421
00:31:21.797 --> 00:31:23.937
The autopsy report says...

422
00:31:24.138 --> 00:31:27.437
Yum Mi Jung's body was stored in a refrigerator.

423
00:31:27.437 --> 00:31:31.277
What refrigerator is big enough to fit an entire human body?

424
00:31:31.638 --> 00:31:33.378
Not unless it was in a hospital, right?

425
00:32:13.148 --> 00:32:14.747
Why do I smell cigarettes?

426
00:32:15.787 --> 00:32:18.287
Ms. Choi doesn't smoke.

427
00:32:25.128 --> 00:32:26.168
My gosh.

428
00:32:28.527 --> 00:32:30.037
She must really be stressed.

429
00:32:31.197 --> 00:32:33.037
She usually doesn't smoke.

430
00:32:39.808 --> 00:32:41.747
(Managing Partner)

431
00:32:43.947 --> 00:32:45.918
What? Why is this on?

432
00:34:03.342 --> 00:34:06.742
(Episode 6 will air shortly.)
