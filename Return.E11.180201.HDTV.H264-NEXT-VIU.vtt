1
00:00:05.745 --> 00:00:07.675
Previously on Return.

2
00:00:09.314 --> 00:00:11.685
Should we bury her in an isolated place?

3
00:00:11.685 --> 00:00:14.785
You are under arrest for murdering and abandoning the body of Ms. Yum.

4
00:00:14.785 --> 00:00:16.754
I will prove his innocence.

5
00:00:17.885 --> 00:00:20.324
Did you confirm the body was his?

6
00:00:20.794 --> 00:00:22.995
Do you really not want to find your son?

7
00:00:25.824 --> 00:00:26.965
Who could it be?

8
00:00:26.965 --> 00:00:28.135
Don't trust anyone.

9
00:00:28.765 --> 00:00:29.894
You crazy fool.

10
00:00:31.434 --> 00:00:33.065
Woo Suk, Sunshine Nursing Home?

11
00:00:33.065 --> 00:00:35.474
I'm not selling the dash cam and the GPS. Take them out from my car.

12
00:00:35.474 --> 00:00:37.175
I smell something awful.

13
00:00:38.904 --> 00:00:40.275
Look at this punk.

14
00:00:41.245 --> 00:00:43.744
(Episode 11)

15
00:00:47.654 --> 00:00:48.754
Where to, sir?

16
00:00:49.614 --> 00:00:51.485
Go straight for now, please.

17
00:00:51.555 --> 00:00:52.555
Okay.

18
00:01:00.394 --> 00:01:02.934
Please make a left turn at the intersection up ahead.

19
00:01:03.095 --> 00:01:04.204
Sure.

20
00:01:06.034 --> 00:01:08.674
- Stop. Stop. - What? All right?

21
00:01:13.044 --> 00:01:15.544
I'll give you 10 dollars extra.

22
00:01:15.544 --> 00:01:17.784
What? Why?

23
00:01:17.945 --> 00:01:20.284
But you have to go when I say so.

24
00:01:20.484 --> 00:01:22.014
Sure. As you please.

25
00:01:29.525 --> 00:01:31.094
- Go. - Are you insane?

26
00:01:31.165 --> 00:01:33.665
- Go. Go. - This is crazy.

27
00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:47.544
- Do you know Sunshine Nursing Home? - Yes.

28
00:01:48.074 --> 00:01:50.215
- Please take me there. - Okay.

29
00:01:56.154 --> 00:01:57.385
Have a nice day!

30
00:01:57.385 --> 00:02:00.094
(Sunshine Nursing Home)

31
00:02:12.765 --> 00:02:14.575
This place is so worn out.

32
00:02:15.735 --> 00:02:18.004
How did they get a permit to be a medical facility?

33
00:02:57.115 --> 00:02:58.115
Ms. Choi?

34
00:02:59.015 --> 00:03:00.384
Why are you here?

35
00:03:03.085 --> 00:03:04.154
What...

36
00:03:05.854 --> 00:03:06.925
is your deal?

37
00:03:06.925 --> 00:03:09.594
What about you? How are you here?

38
00:03:09.594 --> 00:03:11.194
What an amusing question.

39
00:03:11.624 --> 00:03:14.765
Not "why", but "how" am I here?

40
00:03:14.965 --> 00:03:18.664
You must be here for the same reason I am. Am I wrong?

41
00:03:18.904 --> 00:03:21.075
Why don't you let go of me first?

42
00:03:28.045 --> 00:03:31.085
Fine. I'll ask first.

43
00:03:31.085 --> 00:03:32.444
How are you here?

44
00:03:34.184 --> 00:03:35.215
Well...

45
00:03:37.525 --> 00:03:38.985
(Woo Suk, Sunshine Nursing Home)

46
00:03:38.985 --> 00:03:40.854
I can't tell her about Dong Bae.

47
00:03:41.594 --> 00:03:44.795
Can I assume you're in no position to say anything?

48
00:03:44.795 --> 00:03:47.765
Gosh, that's a bit over the top.

49
00:03:48.434 --> 00:03:49.495
The thing is...

50
00:03:50.235 --> 00:03:52.604
Let's clear up the misunderstanding after your call.

51
00:03:56.575 --> 00:03:57.745
Hello?

52
00:03:58.904 --> 00:04:01.615
- How did it go? - Not yet.

53
00:04:03.314 --> 00:04:05.814
- Where are you? - I'm...

54
00:04:10.854 --> 00:04:13.224
going to stop by Mi Jung's bar.

55
00:04:14.025 --> 00:04:15.224
Will you be okay?

56
00:04:18.125 --> 00:04:20.664
If I keep making excuses, I won't get anything done.

57
00:04:23.505 --> 00:04:26.104
I want to do my best.

58
00:04:26.534 --> 00:04:28.104
I like that you're being strong.

59
00:04:28.335 --> 00:04:30.244
When you get to Yum Mi Jung's wine bar,

60
00:04:30.244 --> 00:04:32.174
get the list of regulars.

61
00:04:32.174 --> 00:04:34.015
We need to keep our options open.

62
00:04:34.474 --> 00:04:36.885
I'll call you. Okay.

63
00:04:40.284 --> 00:04:42.414
You're more childish than you look.

64
00:04:42.414 --> 00:04:43.484
Why?

65
00:04:44.784 --> 00:04:47.695
I was just stretching. My hips are misaligned.

66
00:04:53.364 --> 00:04:55.335
Why am I childish? What did I do?

67
00:04:55.465 --> 00:04:57.765
- I was just curious. - Sure.

68
00:05:00.534 --> 00:05:01.775
You know,

69
00:05:02.174 --> 00:05:06.205
you have a way to offend people in a polite manner.

70
00:05:06.404 --> 00:05:07.575
Sure.

71
00:05:09.275 --> 00:05:11.344
Gosh. I get it now.

72
00:05:11.484 --> 00:05:14.414
I get why you're still single, with your looks and success.

73
00:05:16.455 --> 00:05:18.885
Your body temperature must be about 32°C.

74
00:05:32.765 --> 00:05:34.205
What was that?

75
00:05:34.375 --> 00:05:36.534
She looks as cold as ice.

76
00:05:37.904 --> 00:05:39.044
Was she hurt?

77
00:05:40.414 --> 00:05:41.914
(Setting Up)

78
00:05:56.895 --> 00:05:58.664
Is it your first time here?

79
00:06:00.265 --> 00:06:01.335
Yes.

80
00:06:01.335 --> 00:06:04.104
We open at 8pm.

81
00:06:04.104 --> 00:06:05.335
Yes, I know.

82
00:06:06.635 --> 00:06:07.674
Ms. Yum...

83
00:06:09.674 --> 00:06:13.445
I came to ask a few things about Yum Mi Jung.

84
00:06:13.575 --> 00:06:16.914
I'm sorry, but we have nothing to say about that.

85
00:06:16.914 --> 00:06:17.984
I'm Kang In Ho's...

86
00:06:21.185 --> 00:06:22.315
wife.

87
00:06:32.565 --> 00:06:34.935
I'm asking because I don't know.

88
00:06:35.935 --> 00:06:38.304
Don't they give medical treatments in nursing homes?

89
00:06:39.005 --> 00:06:42.135
How could a place like this perform medical treatments?

90
00:06:45.145 --> 00:06:46.145
What are you doing?

91
00:06:46.674 --> 00:06:49.674
You'll be embarrassed if you overreact like this.

92
00:06:54.315 --> 00:06:56.015
You may be embarrassed if you are.

93
00:06:56.825 --> 00:06:57.924
What is it?

94
00:06:59.784 --> 00:07:01.025
(Kang Sul Jin)

95
00:07:02.625 --> 00:07:04.494
Ms. Kang Sul Jin.

96
00:07:05.525 --> 00:07:06.765
(Kang Sul Jin)

97
00:07:09.164 --> 00:07:10.904
Hello. I have a question...

98
00:07:10.904 --> 00:07:14.604
Do you have a room where you can see the lake?

99
00:07:14.604 --> 00:07:17.505
I'd like to move my mother to a room like that.

100
00:07:18.804 --> 00:07:20.575
Are you husband and wife?

101
00:07:20.575 --> 00:07:21.645
- No. - Yes.

102
00:07:23.614 --> 00:07:24.645
No.

103
00:07:25.385 --> 00:07:29.015
I'm not sure if we have any vacant rooms.

104
00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:34.354
You seem pretty high up here. Am I right?

105
00:07:36.494 --> 00:07:39.594
May I ask for some help from such a beautiful lady?

106
00:07:41.135 --> 00:07:43.904
I'm sure there must be one room.

107
00:07:44.705 --> 00:07:48.734
There are three rooms with a view of the lake.

108
00:07:49.234 --> 00:07:52.275
Room 202 is occupied,

109
00:07:52.804 --> 00:07:55.174
and one is being renovated.

110
00:07:55.645 --> 00:07:58.544
Would you like to take a look first?

111
00:07:58.645 --> 00:08:00.255
Yes. May we take a look now?

112
00:08:00.455 --> 00:08:01.484
- Sure. - Thank you.

113
00:08:04.284 --> 00:08:05.385
What are you up to?

114
00:08:05.385 --> 00:08:07.455
Seriously, how did you find this place?

115
00:08:07.895 --> 00:08:11.125
I can't tell you now because I have a personal matter to resolve first.

116
00:08:11.125 --> 00:08:13.465
What about you? How did you find this place?

117
00:08:13.465 --> 00:08:16.935
I can't tell you because I can't trust you.

118
00:08:18.205 --> 00:08:20.804
My goodness. Nothing is easy with her.

119
00:08:34.785 --> 00:08:35.815
Sweetie.

120
00:08:50.435 --> 00:08:52.165
- You came. - Yes.

121
00:09:08.585 --> 00:09:09.585
Excuse me.

122
00:09:10.884 --> 00:09:11.984
I'm sorry.

123
00:09:12.754 --> 00:09:14.494
I must be in your way.

124
00:09:28.075 --> 00:09:29.705
What is this wine fridge for?

125
00:09:30.445 --> 00:09:32.805
We use that to keep wine...

126
00:09:32.805 --> 00:09:34.514
for VIP customers.

127
00:09:34.514 --> 00:09:36.614
I see. May I take a look?

128
00:09:36.815 --> 00:09:38.045
Well, sure.

129
00:09:43.524 --> 00:09:45.585
(Kang In Ho)

130
00:09:49.594 --> 00:09:52.965
(Kim Jung Soo)

131
00:09:56.905 --> 00:10:02.405
(Kim Jung Soo)

132
00:10:07.244 --> 00:10:09.244
You shouldn't open this without permission.

133
00:10:09.715 --> 00:10:10.744
I'm sorry.

134
00:10:24.394 --> 00:10:26.295
You... You can't come in here.

135
00:11:05.264 --> 00:11:06.504
My way.

136
00:11:13.175 --> 00:11:14.974
He has finally lost it.

137
00:11:23.655 --> 00:11:25.325
Salute.

138
00:11:26.224 --> 00:11:27.724
I can't bear the sight of him.

139
00:11:28.254 --> 00:11:30.364
I should cut off that jerk's arm.

140
00:11:52.415 --> 00:11:55.114
That jerk got some nerve. Darn him.

141
00:12:08.935 --> 00:12:10.035
I'm sorry.

142
00:12:14.075 --> 00:12:15.075
You seem quite angry.

143
00:12:16.035 --> 00:12:18.205
My gosh, what's the matter with you?

144
00:12:18.844 --> 00:12:21.144
I almost ran you over.

145
00:12:22.215 --> 00:12:23.844
Should I have just killed you?

146
00:12:25.514 --> 00:12:26.785
No, I shouldn't, right?

147
00:12:28.514 --> 00:12:29.854
If you die,

148
00:12:30.524 --> 00:12:32.984
who's going to find cars for me?

149
00:12:33.594 --> 00:12:34.594
Right?

150
00:12:37.764 --> 00:12:38.764
Right.

151
00:12:39.994 --> 00:12:41.065
If I die,

152
00:12:42.234 --> 00:12:43.565
who will get you your cars?

153
00:12:46.364 --> 00:12:47.535
But why are you empty-handed?

154
00:12:48.504 --> 00:12:50.744
Where are my dash cam and GPS?

155
00:12:53.205 --> 00:12:54.244
Oh, right.

156
00:12:54.774 --> 00:12:55.815
"Oh, right?"

157
00:12:56.374 --> 00:12:57.644
You crazy jerk.

158
00:12:58.114 --> 00:13:01.185
If you didn't bring them, why did you want me to meet you here?

159
00:13:02.455 --> 00:13:03.524
Why is that?

160
00:13:05.155 --> 00:13:06.524
It's quiet here.

161
00:13:07.094 --> 00:13:08.354
It's a great place to talk too.

162
00:13:10.425 --> 00:13:11.524
And this place is even better...

163
00:13:13.594 --> 00:13:14.594
to blackmail someone.

164
00:13:22.535 --> 00:13:23.575
Look at me.

165
00:13:25.874 --> 00:13:26.945
Are you high?

166
00:13:28.415 --> 00:13:29.545
Stop talking nonsense.

167
00:13:30.644 --> 00:13:32.014
I don't care how,

168
00:13:32.744 --> 00:13:36.155
but you must bring them to me within 10 minutes.

169
00:13:37.085 --> 00:13:38.624
Bring them to me now!

170
00:13:38.854 --> 00:13:40.624
I told you that may prove difficult.

171
00:13:41.024 --> 00:13:42.024
What?

172
00:13:44.195 --> 00:13:45.764
Gosh, what a jerk.

173
00:13:46.465 --> 00:13:48.195
Stop hitting me before I run out of patience.

174
00:13:49.234 --> 00:13:50.264
Calm down.

175
00:13:53.935 --> 00:13:55.035
Take a look at this.

176
00:13:57.774 --> 00:13:59.104
You jerk.

177
00:13:59.244 --> 00:14:01.274
What are you doing? Why aren't you helping?

178
00:14:01.415 --> 00:14:03.844
Darn. Why is this thing to heavy?

179
00:14:03.844 --> 00:14:06.114
- Hurry. - Why are you so quiet?

180
00:14:06.185 --> 00:14:08.384
Come on. Hold it.

181
00:14:08.555 --> 00:14:10.085
1, 2, 3.

182
00:14:15.055 --> 00:14:17.594
Hey. What do we do now?

183
00:14:18.295 --> 00:14:20.335
Should we dig a hole and bury it?

184
00:14:20.665 --> 00:14:21.894
You crazy jerk.

Goodness.

You're a man. This video shouldn't scare you!

188
00:14:46.724 --> 00:14:49.854
I didn't even mention Seo Joon Hee yet.

189
00:14:53.394 --> 00:14:56.734
I had no idea that you guys were at each other's throat.

190
00:14:57.504 --> 00:14:58.535
I'm serious.

191
00:14:59.134 --> 00:15:00.175
I really didn't know.

Here's the thing. It was too easy...

00:15:07.244 --> 00:15:10.614
to restore the deleted videos.

195
00:15:15.815 --> 00:15:17.785
Korea is an IT powerhouse.

Get a grip, jerk. Don't you dare glare at me.

You should wake up now.

219
00:17:15.935 --> 00:17:20.445
Do you think I came out here without a backup plan, you moron?

220

That's all right.

221
00:17:23.615 --> 00:17:25.584
I can just kill you here.

222
00:17:26.915 --> 00:17:28.984
Do you think so? You think you can do that?

223
00:17:29.655 --> 00:17:31.925
I know that you have a nasty temper.

224
00:17:32.084 --> 00:17:35.494
Do you think I came here without leaving any evidence?

225
00:17:35.494 --> 00:17:37.524
I've been living the drama lately.

226

Hey, then let me tell you this at this point.

Hey, what is it that you want from me?

228

I know that you're scared, jerk.

229
00:17:48.504 --> 00:17:51.504
Sure. I want you and Oh Tae Suk...

230
00:17:52.145 --> 00:17:54.715
to pay me 1 million each. I want 2 million dollars in total.

231
00:17:55.375 --> 00:17:56.474
You're scared now, aren't you?

232
00:17:56.845 --> 00:17:58.014
You coward.

233
00:17:59.215 --> 00:18:02.554
You're Oh Tae Suk's sidekick. I shouldn't be talking to you.

234
00:18:02.915 --> 00:18:05.554
- I should call him myself. - My gosh.

Or call someone who can come up with the money.

00:18:15.365 --> 00:18:17.135
You'll go down for this too.

- Sure. Okay. - Get your foot off my face.

We're not supposed to do this.

- Your call cannot be connected... - What should I do?

244
00:18:34.115 --> 00:18:37.155
I... I can't let you take him like this.

245
00:18:37.155 --> 00:18:40.155
Let me contact his guardian first.

246
00:18:40.324 --> 00:18:41.455
You can take him then.

247
00:18:41.824 --> 00:18:44.024
Show me his registration form for the facility.

248
00:18:44.564 --> 00:18:46.595
- Sorry? - Or better yet,

249
00:18:46.794 --> 00:18:49.534
I would like to see the permit for this nursing home.

250
00:18:56.405 --> 00:18:57.405
Come here.

251
00:18:57.774 --> 00:18:58.804
Okay.

00:19:01.544 --> 00:19:02.544
Your cellphone.

253
00:19:03.244 --> 00:19:04.784
Why... Why?

254
00:19:04.784 --> 00:19:06.514
- Then I must see the permit. - Wait.

261
00:19:42.215 --> 00:19:43.215
Yes, Mr. Seo.

262
00:19:44.084 --> 00:19:46.554
Yes, I just put Seo Joon Hee in the ambulance.

263
00:19:47.125 --> 00:19:49.095
If we leave for Daemyung Hospital now,

264
00:19:49.524 --> 00:19:52.465
we'll be there within four hours at the latest. Okay.

265
00:19:53.494 --> 00:19:55.794
Yes, I'll call you as soon as we arrive in Seoul.

266

Okay.

267

- Where's your car? - Well,

269
00:20:12.784 --> 00:20:15.054
as you can see, my arm was injured.

270
00:20:16.615 --> 00:20:18.284
Then you can ride with me.

271
00:20:18.855 --> 00:20:19.855
Can I?

272
00:20:20.195 --> 00:20:22.595
We need to clear some things up too.

273
00:20:22.824 --> 00:20:25.494
It's the car parked up front, right? The fancy one.

274
00:20:32.165 --> 00:20:33.474
She's cold. So cold.

275

My gosh, she's cold.

276

My goodness.

277
00:20:47.455 --> 00:20:50.885
Sir, we're going to follow you anyway,

278
00:20:51.125 --> 00:20:53.395
but we might lose each other on the way.

279
00:20:53.395 --> 00:20:55.824
So please take good care of him until you reach Daemyung Hospital.

280
00:21:01.395 --> 00:21:02.395
Just a minute.

281
00:21:12.044 --> 00:21:13.445
Excuse me, but...

282
00:21:14.645 --> 00:21:16.115
please remove your mask.

283

Stop the car. Stop the car, you punk.

I told you to stop the car.

Hey, stop the car.

286

What's your problem? Are you insane?

Young!

288
00:23:08.625 --> 00:23:12.395
I'm fine. Go after the ambulance. Hurry!

289
00:23:13.965 --> 00:23:16.905
Okay. Then put out an APB for license plate 10G6770.

290

Tae Suk.

298
00:24:24.665 --> 00:24:28.705
How much did we pay for that Jules Rimet Trophy?

299
00:24:33.145 --> 00:24:34.314
660,000 dollars.

300
00:24:36.115 --> 00:24:39.415
It's enough to buy three Jules Rimet Trophies.

301
00:24:39.784 --> 00:24:41.455
What gibberish is that?

302
00:24:44.455 --> 00:24:48.195
Hey. We were threatened. He wants two million dollars.

But how dare you look at me like that?

326
