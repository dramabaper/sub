1
00:00:17.526 --> 00:00:19.886
- You look tired.
- You look tired.

2
00:00:26.396 --> 00:00:28.036
The woman who is
dressed in silk,

3
00:00:28.036 --> 00:00:29.867
pretending to be
your wife is...

4
00:00:30.607 --> 00:00:32.367
the wicked woman
who killed you.

5
00:00:34.076 --> 00:00:35.337
You were meant to be...

6
00:00:36.107 --> 00:00:38.247
with the kind
servant girl...

7
00:00:38.707 --> 00:00:40.817
with a burn scar
on her face.

8
00:00:42.616 --> 00:00:44.686
You don't look so well.

9
00:00:49.487 --> 00:00:50.487
Soo Ho.

10
00:00:51.857 --> 00:00:53.027
Are you feeling okay?

11
00:01:03.697 --> 00:01:06.036
What's wrong?
You look very out of it.

12
00:01:06.506 --> 00:01:07.936
Do you still
have a headache?

13
00:01:09.277 --> 00:01:10.906
No, I'm fine.

14
00:01:13.747 --> 00:01:15.316
I came to
pick up some stuff.

15
00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:17.887
I left some things behind.

16
00:01:20.617 --> 00:01:23.887
I'm sorry to bother you
this late at night.

17
00:01:24.656 --> 00:01:26.456
Please let me apologize...

18
00:01:27.326 --> 00:01:29.826
on behalf of
Sharon's ignorance.

19
00:01:32.397 --> 00:01:33.397
Let's go.

20
00:01:35.966 --> 00:01:37.037
Come on.

21
00:01:58.227 --> 00:02:00.057
You should wash up
and get some sleep.

22
00:02:01.697 --> 00:02:02.697
Okay.

23
00:02:12.137 --> 00:02:13.637
(Episode 16)

24
00:02:18.176 --> 00:02:20.377
Did you feel anything odd
about Moon Soo Ho?

25
00:02:21.317 --> 00:02:23.546
- No.
- I felt it.

26
00:02:24.646 --> 00:02:26.516
Something about him
has changed.

27
00:02:26.717 --> 00:02:27.887
Come to think about it,

28
00:02:28.586 --> 00:02:30.627
it looked like
he did lose some weight.

29
00:02:31.586 --> 00:02:33.627
Or maybe he gained some...

30
00:02:33.896 --> 00:02:36.197
after he kicked you out.

31
00:02:40.366 --> 00:02:41.597
Something is
definitely going on.

32
00:04:09.257 --> 00:04:11.187
When confusion comes,
let it pass by.

33
00:04:13.896 --> 00:04:16.056
Your beautiful moment is
right here and now.

34
00:04:17.026 --> 00:04:18.127
Soo Ho.

35
00:04:18.866 --> 00:04:21.396
What's important is that
you're with Hae Ra now.

36
00:04:22.967 --> 00:04:23.967
Of course.

37
00:04:26.107 --> 00:04:27.436
I know that.

38
00:04:43.657 --> 00:04:44.686
Aunt Sook Hee.

39
00:04:44.886 --> 00:04:45.926
Hey.

40
00:04:47.027 --> 00:04:49.996
Did Mr. Moon
never come back home?

41
00:04:49.996 --> 00:04:52.527
Or did he
just leave early?

42
00:04:53.467 --> 00:04:55.037
I saw him leaving...

43
00:04:55.037 --> 00:04:56.566
when I went to
use the bathroom.

44
00:04:59.566 --> 00:05:01.537
Is he disappointed
about work?

45
00:05:04.376 --> 00:05:05.446
I'm off to work.

46
00:05:05.946 --> 00:05:08.147
Have some fruit
before you leave.

47
00:05:08.147 --> 00:05:09.347
It's all yours.

48
00:05:21.457 --> 00:05:22.457
That's 100,000 dollars.

49
00:05:22.857 --> 00:05:24.626
Take this to
borrow that picture.

50
00:05:26.527 --> 00:05:27.936
I thought
it wasn't for sale.

51
00:05:27.936 --> 00:05:29.866
That's why I'm asking you
to borrow it.

52
00:05:30.097 --> 00:05:31.566
Tell them I'll return it
in three days.

53
00:05:32.467 --> 00:05:33.467
It seems like...

54
00:05:33.806 --> 00:05:35.607
you'll rip it
once I bring it over.

55
00:05:35.907 --> 00:05:37.006
Get going.

56
00:06:10.577 --> 00:06:12.077
How much did you tell him?

57
00:06:12.977 --> 00:06:15.176
Did you tell him that
you had killed them?

58
00:06:17.587 --> 00:06:19.087
I told him everything.

59
00:06:19.087 --> 00:06:21.256
Why did you when he
wouldn't believe it?

60
00:06:29.496 --> 00:06:31.397
I told him
because he wouldn't.

61
00:06:32.527 --> 00:06:34.296
I guess
it still bothered him.

62
00:06:35.267 --> 00:06:37.136
Since he went to you
and talked about it.

63
00:06:38.107 --> 00:06:39.236
I will...

64
00:06:40.306 --> 00:06:41.676
die someday.

65
00:06:42.537 --> 00:06:44.246
And you'll be lonely
alone.

66
00:06:44.806 --> 00:06:45.946
You should find a way...

67
00:06:46.777 --> 00:06:49.246
come into time.

68
00:06:49.876 --> 00:06:50.886
Please.

69
00:06:50.886 --> 00:06:53.517
It'll happen
once he becomes my man.

70
00:06:54.316 --> 00:06:57.386
I will be able to age
and grow old.

71
00:06:57.986 --> 00:06:59.256
That won't happen.

72
00:06:59.386 --> 00:07:00.496
He...

73
00:07:01.756 --> 00:07:03.926
started to remember me.

74
00:07:05.496 --> 00:07:06.527
I know it.

75
00:07:07.897 --> 00:07:10.936
It's not just your prayers
that get answered.

76
00:07:12.167 --> 00:07:14.207
It's about time
my sorrow...

77
00:07:15.607 --> 00:07:17.246
is answered.

78
00:07:17.707 --> 00:07:18.806
If you...

79
00:07:19.676 --> 00:07:21.546
play a trick on Soo Ho,

80
00:07:23.116 --> 00:07:24.546
I won't let it slide.

81
00:07:26.587 --> 00:07:28.056
Pay for my cup you broke.

82
00:07:42.167 --> 00:07:43.866
There's nothing wrong.

83
00:07:44.236 --> 00:07:45.407
You're good.

84
00:07:47.676 --> 00:07:49.806
The results from your
last month's checkup...

85
00:07:49.806 --> 00:07:51.077
are very good too.

86
00:07:51.847 --> 00:07:53.917
I'm having headaches
all of a sudden.

87
00:07:55.176 --> 00:07:57.347
The wound on your
forehead is all healed.

88
00:07:57.347 --> 00:07:59.246
That wouldn't
cause a headache.

89
00:07:59.246 --> 00:08:01.857
My ears are ringing,
and I'm hearing things.

90
00:08:02.186 --> 00:08:05.186
Are you having
a lot of stress lately?

91
00:08:07.357 --> 00:08:08.626
It must be stress.

92
00:08:08.897 --> 00:08:10.196
Have something...

93
00:08:10.196 --> 00:08:12.897
delicious for lunch
with someone you like.

94
00:08:13.267 --> 00:08:15.696
And do some exercise
in the weekends.

95
00:08:15.996 --> 00:08:17.136
Yes, Doctor.

96
00:08:35.717 --> 00:08:37.157
This pizza is so good.

97
00:08:37.287 --> 00:08:38.756
Have more
before it gets cold.

98
00:08:39.457 --> 00:08:40.557
Your ring is pretty.

99
00:08:44.427 --> 00:08:45.597
Are you sick?

100
00:08:46.197 --> 00:08:47.797
I heard you went to
see a doctor.

101
00:08:48.597 --> 00:08:49.736
How did you know?

102
00:08:49.797 --> 00:08:50.906
I went to your office...

103
00:08:50.906 --> 00:08:52.166
so I could
come here with you.

104
00:08:52.266 --> 00:08:54.207
There's nothing wrong.
I'm very healthy.

105
00:08:55.536 --> 00:08:57.506
You're a strong person.

106
00:08:57.506 --> 00:08:58.947
Don't be stressed out.

107
00:09:02.416 --> 00:09:04.047
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.

108
00:09:04.587 --> 00:09:05.817
It doesn't matter
if it doesn't,

109
00:09:05.817 --> 00:09:06.886
because I have you.

110
00:09:07.986 --> 00:09:09.156
You're right.

111
00:09:12.457 --> 00:09:14.126
- Hae Ra.
- Yes?

112
00:09:16.256 --> 00:09:17.896
Let's get married
in spring.

113
00:09:20.197 --> 00:09:21.567
Why are you rushing it?

114
00:09:22.736 --> 00:09:24.136
Then when would be good?

115
00:09:29.536 --> 00:09:30.876
Like two years later?

116
00:09:31.577 --> 00:09:32.577
Two years?

117
00:09:33.547 --> 00:09:35.447
I should accomplish
something.

118
00:09:36.016 --> 00:09:37.447
I should get
a promotion...

119
00:09:37.447 --> 00:09:39.416
and go on overseas
business trips too.

120
00:09:40.457 --> 00:09:41.857
You can do that
after you get married.

121
00:09:41.857 --> 00:09:43.786
Do you think I'll stop you
from working?

122
00:09:44.526 --> 00:09:45.687
No.

123
00:09:46.857 --> 00:09:48.227
Well, you know,

124
00:09:48.227 --> 00:09:49.857
I want to get prepared.

125
00:09:50.526 --> 00:09:53.097
Let's take care of
your dad's case first,

126
00:09:53.097 --> 00:09:54.366
then get married.

127
00:09:56.197 --> 00:09:57.937
If that's what you want,
okay.

128
00:10:13.486 --> 00:10:15.687
The prosecution will
reinvestigate the case.

129
00:10:16.087 --> 00:10:17.386
Because the police
had been...

130
00:10:17.386 --> 00:10:19.526
bribed by the construction
company.

131
00:10:19.886 --> 00:10:22.256
Will Chairman Park be
called in as a testifier?

132
00:10:22.357 --> 00:10:25.097
Yes. I'm going there
with a witness too.

133
00:10:25.697 --> 00:10:27.136
Should I drop you off
at the travel agency?

134
00:10:27.136 --> 00:10:28.896
No, at the subway station.

135
00:10:29.036 --> 00:10:30.396
I have to
go to the gallery.

136
00:10:30.837 --> 00:10:31.906
Okay.

137
00:10:32.906 --> 00:10:35.136
Sharon Tailor hasn't
contacted you, right?

138
00:10:36.437 --> 00:10:37.447
No.

139
00:10:38.807 --> 00:10:40.406
Don't meet with her
even if she does.

140
00:10:50.057 --> 00:10:52.626
We're almost ready.
We'll leave soon.

141
00:10:53.526 --> 00:10:55.996
Yes. I got the message.

142
00:10:56.526 --> 00:10:58.526
Thank you
for letting me observe.

143
00:10:58.896 --> 00:10:59.896
Yes.

144
00:11:08.337 --> 00:11:09.736
What are you doing here?

145
00:11:12.577 --> 00:11:14.447
Sharon told me...

146
00:11:15.016 --> 00:11:17.347
to rent this painting.

147
00:11:27.526 --> 00:11:29.957
It'll be published on
an Archaeology Journal.

148
00:11:30.327 --> 00:11:33.366
Okay. Then I'll see you
at your office, Professor.

149
00:11:33.797 --> 00:11:34.797
Okay.

150
00:11:36.236 --> 00:11:37.337
Jeom Bok.

151
00:11:37.636 --> 00:11:39.036
I mean, Jang Bin.

152
00:11:42.207 --> 00:11:43.276
Hello.

153
00:11:44.006 --> 00:11:45.006
You're here again.

154
00:11:45.006 --> 00:11:47.746
Can we talk for a moment?

155
00:11:48.947 --> 00:11:51.786
I'm sorry, but I have to
go somewhere now.

156
00:11:53.246 --> 00:11:54.357
Are you...

157
00:11:54.786 --> 00:11:57.016
on your way to see
a document...

158
00:11:57.016 --> 00:11:58.427
from Joseon Dynasty?

159
00:11:59.656 --> 00:12:01.457
Yes, how did you know?

160
00:12:02.357 --> 00:12:05.097
May I come with you?

161
00:12:05.526 --> 00:12:06.626
I'm sorry.

162
00:12:06.626 --> 00:12:08.597
It can't be shown
to the public yet.

163
00:12:09.496 --> 00:12:10.567
Then...

164
00:12:11.437 --> 00:12:14.406
give me just 10 minutes
of your time.

165
00:12:15.036 --> 00:12:16.876
I have something
to tell you.

166
00:12:21.116 --> 00:12:22.817
You won't regret it.

167
00:12:25.347 --> 00:12:26.746
All right.

168
00:12:28.317 --> 00:12:29.786
Let's go outside.

169
00:12:30.357 --> 00:12:32.687
Could you bring me...

170
00:12:32.687 --> 00:12:35.496
a mop or a spare chair?

171
00:13:13.697 --> 00:13:16.067
He went to the parking lot
with a guest.

172
00:13:16.297 --> 00:13:17.666
The parking lot?

173
00:13:29.416 --> 00:13:30.687
Hello.

174
00:13:57.477 --> 00:13:58.906
Haven't you ever seen...

175
00:13:59.347 --> 00:14:00.547
Baek Hee do that?

176
00:14:26.036 --> 00:14:27.807
I'm not trying to
scare you.

177
00:14:27.807 --> 00:14:29.577
I showed you...

178
00:14:29.636 --> 00:14:31.047
because you need to
believe me.

179
00:14:32.146 --> 00:14:33.177
I am...

180
00:14:34.047 --> 00:14:37.317
a bit different
from ordinary people.

181
00:14:39.016 --> 00:14:40.016
I see.

182
00:14:52.866 --> 00:14:54.396
We have more audience.

183
00:14:56.666 --> 00:14:57.967
That's all right.

184
00:15:01.736 --> 00:15:03.077
You will see...

185
00:15:03.776 --> 00:15:06.477
a painting done by
Koo Jeom Bok,

186
00:15:06.776 --> 00:15:08.947
your grandfathers'
grandfather's father.

187
00:15:09.246 --> 00:15:11.416
a long story behind it,

188
00:15:12.016 --> 00:15:13.916
and a letter of prayer.

189
00:15:14.857 --> 00:15:18.626
He probably wrote a story
of a man and two women.

190
00:15:20.557 --> 00:15:22.896
I will tell you
that story now.

191
00:15:23.427 --> 00:15:26.067
If my story matches
the letter of prayer,

192
00:15:27.136 --> 00:15:29.266
please do me a favor.

193
00:15:31.036 --> 00:15:32.236
What would that be?

194
00:15:35.437 --> 00:15:39.107
Tell me what's written on
Jeom Bok's prayer.

195
00:15:39.977 --> 00:15:41.016
And...

196
00:15:42.516 --> 00:15:44.347
let me see...

197
00:15:44.786 --> 00:15:47.087
the document
with the story in person.

198
00:15:52.756 --> 00:15:55.827
Okay, if your story
matches the document,

199
00:15:56.126 --> 00:15:57.996
I'll let you see
the prayer...

200
00:15:58.396 --> 00:16:00.097
and the document yourself.

201
00:16:09.677 --> 00:16:12.677
About 230 years ago
from now,

202
00:16:14.876 --> 00:16:16.776
there was a lady...

203
00:16:16.776 --> 00:16:18.687
who was about to get
married to a noble family.

204
00:16:20.486 --> 00:16:22.687
There was also
her servant...

205
00:16:23.016 --> 00:16:25.486
who was supposed to make
her lady's wedding dress.

206
00:16:58.457 --> 00:17:02.427
The lady burned her
servant's face...

207
00:17:02.427 --> 00:17:04.067
with an iron for trying
the wedding dress on.

208
00:17:08.136 --> 00:17:09.366
The groom mistook the
servant as his bride...

209
00:17:09.366 --> 00:17:11.267
because she was
wearing the dress.

210
00:17:11.966 --> 00:17:14.307
He swore that he'd
love her for all his life.

211
00:17:39.567 --> 00:17:40.837
She's crazy.

212
00:17:40.997 --> 00:17:42.597
I couldn't ask him
for the painting...

213
00:17:42.636 --> 00:17:44.636
in that situation.

214
00:17:45.837 --> 00:17:47.777
I enjoyed the old
fairytale instead.

215
00:17:48.307 --> 00:17:51.176
She said such a story
came out from the grave?

216
00:17:51.176 --> 00:17:52.946
Baek Hee
asked Jeom Bok...

217
00:17:53.607 --> 00:17:56.047
to leave the story...

218
00:17:56.277 --> 00:17:57.547
in a writing.

219
00:18:00.956 --> 00:18:02.357
She's crazy.

220
00:18:03.886 --> 00:18:06.656
Lady Seo Rin told others
her husband was Catholic,

221
00:18:08.126 --> 00:18:10.926
and made Boon Yi
wear her clothes.

222
00:18:11.297 --> 00:18:14.267
She drove her to a cliff.

223
00:18:23.946 --> 00:18:25.976
She wanted Boon Yi to die.

224
00:18:26.706 --> 00:18:28.077
But she endured it...

225
00:18:28.446 --> 00:18:29.817
with the power of love.

226
00:18:41.956 --> 00:18:44.196
She was stabbed
and lost her voice.

227
00:18:44.666 --> 00:18:47.737
She traveled a long way
to see her lover.

228
00:18:58.007 --> 00:19:00.107
But Lady Seo Rin went
blind out of jealousy...

229
00:19:00.206 --> 00:19:02.376
and burned the two
to death.

230
00:19:11.827 --> 00:19:13.626
She was then cursed
by Boon Yi.

231
00:19:13.896 --> 00:19:16.426
You'll be a ghost...

232
00:19:19.497 --> 00:19:21.537
who wanders around
this world forever.

233
00:19:24.107 --> 00:19:25.466
She became a being...

234
00:19:25.466 --> 00:19:27.936
who neither gets old
nor dies.

235
00:19:32.706 --> 00:19:34.347
He was asked...

236
00:19:34.876 --> 00:19:36.547
Please do it for me.

237
00:19:38.487 --> 00:19:40.616
He was asked to record...

238
00:19:41.156 --> 00:19:42.956
everything that happened.

239
00:20:31.866 --> 00:20:33.537
Why didn't you go
to the office?

240
00:20:35.237 --> 00:20:36.436
I couldn't go
back to work...

241
00:20:36.436 --> 00:20:38.247
after seeing such a thing.

242
00:20:40.047 --> 00:20:41.777
Have you never seen
a strong person?

243
00:20:41.777 --> 00:20:44.347
You already heard the
story during my speech.

244
00:20:46.517 --> 00:20:48.686
I want to wait
here with you and see...

245
00:20:51.057 --> 00:20:53.926
if I can read the document
with my own eyes.

246
00:20:55.126 --> 00:20:57.097
I didn't know you're
such a curious girl.

247
00:21:00.027 --> 00:21:02.567
It feels strange.

248
00:21:04.636 --> 00:21:05.737
How strange?

249
00:21:06.436 --> 00:21:09.706
It's unbelievable
and flustering.

250
00:21:11.107 --> 00:21:14.347
Do you feel like
the story is about you?

251
00:21:14.946 --> 00:21:16.416
No, it's not that.

252
00:21:18.847 --> 00:21:21.087
Will there be
that document for real?

253
00:21:22.656 --> 00:21:25.487
I guess not since he has
not called me until now.

254
00:21:26.787 --> 00:21:29.126
Don't worry,
and go back to work.

255
00:21:34.737 --> 00:21:37.237
Chairman Park
suspects Mr. Jung.

256
00:21:37.237 --> 00:21:40.206
It's the photo taken
at the night of the fire.

257
00:21:40.737 --> 00:21:42.476
Mr. Jung has nothing to
do with the accident.

258
00:21:43.906 --> 00:21:45.146
Well noted.

259
00:21:45.146 --> 00:21:46.876
We'll look more into this.

260
00:21:48.446 --> 00:21:50.247
- Mr. Han Myung Soo.
- Yes?

261
00:21:50.247 --> 00:21:52.017
When you were the director
of the construction firm,

262
00:21:52.017 --> 00:21:53.747
did the company bribe
someone...

263
00:21:53.916 --> 00:21:56.916
to set a fire at the lab
on purpose?

264
00:21:57.386 --> 00:21:59.686
I didn't know
at that time,

265
00:22:01.357 --> 00:22:03.926
but I heard later on that
such a thing happened.

266
00:22:05.067 --> 00:22:06.966
The one in charge of...

267
00:22:06.966 --> 00:22:08.966
the development business
team passed away.

268
00:22:09.297 --> 00:22:10.966
More details
can't be found.

269
00:22:11.237 --> 00:22:13.466
So there is someone
who was bribed...

270
00:22:13.466 --> 00:22:15.936
and set a fire on the lab.

271
00:22:16.537 --> 00:22:18.047
That's what I heard.

272
00:22:19.976 --> 00:22:21.446
What's the name
of that person?

273
00:22:25.347 --> 00:22:28.386
Jang Chul Doo
took the money.

274
00:22:28.517 --> 00:22:30.116
He was with three
previous convictions...

275
00:22:30.116 --> 00:22:31.487
for theft and arson.

276
00:22:31.487 --> 00:22:33.487
He died after
overdoing drugs...

277
00:22:33.487 --> 00:22:34.896
five years ago.

278
00:22:37.196 --> 00:22:40.936
There's no trace of
our money transaction.

279
00:22:41.696 --> 00:22:43.636
No one can prove that.

280
00:22:54.976 --> 00:22:57.587
It's not a small
amount of money.

281
00:23:02.017 --> 00:23:03.487
What's the name
of that person?

282
00:23:04.027 --> 00:23:06.386
I heard it's a man
named Jang Chul Doo.

283
00:23:12.166 --> 00:23:13.997
Park Chul Min made a move
a bit faster than us.

284
00:23:14.737 --> 00:23:16.567
We have enough
objective evidence,

285
00:23:16.567 --> 00:23:18.366
so they won't fully trust
his testimony.

286
00:23:18.537 --> 00:23:19.567
And...

287
00:23:19.737 --> 00:23:22.307
Mr. Yoon will be there
as a testifier,

288
00:23:22.436 --> 00:23:23.876
so don't worry too much.

289
00:23:25.007 --> 00:23:26.047
All right.

290
00:23:26.176 --> 00:23:27.317
You look tired.

291
00:23:28.347 --> 00:23:29.747
Go home early today.

292
00:23:31.047 --> 00:23:32.146
I'm okay.

293
00:23:32.347 --> 00:23:33.487
Hello.

294
00:23:35.087 --> 00:23:37.527
I'm sorry for visiting
here without any notice.

295
00:23:38.787 --> 00:23:40.997
I thought I needed
to put an end.

296
00:23:43.257 --> 00:23:46.426
I decided to support
the redevelopment.

297
00:23:47.497 --> 00:23:49.737
Please return the
agreement that I signed.

298
00:23:50.067 --> 00:23:52.436
Or destroy it
in front of me.

299
00:23:52.966 --> 00:23:54.007
Mr. Han.

300
00:23:54.777 --> 00:23:55.777
Okay.

301
00:23:56.777 --> 00:23:58.176
I'll find it for you.

302
00:23:58.507 --> 00:23:59.577
Please follow me.

303
00:24:04.087 --> 00:24:06.216
The public hearing
was very amusing.

304
00:24:08.757 --> 00:24:09.817
Good day.

305
00:24:11.027 --> 00:24:12.156
That day,

306
00:24:13.896 --> 00:24:15.527
what was it that
you told me again?

307
00:24:18.297 --> 00:24:19.366
When?

308
00:24:19.696 --> 00:24:21.196
The day you moved
out of my house.

309
00:24:26.067 --> 00:24:28.476
That I was your love
in your previous life.

310
00:24:28.837 --> 00:24:30.406
And that you have
to remember me...

311
00:24:30.706 --> 00:24:32.676
and finish
our incomplete love.

312
00:24:35.476 --> 00:24:37.317
Why did you say
such a thing to me?

313
00:24:37.987 --> 00:24:39.616
Are you bothered by it?

314
00:24:45.487 --> 00:24:46.787
I don't believe it,

315
00:24:46.926 --> 00:24:48.626
but even if it
actually happened,

316
00:24:50.057 --> 00:24:51.827
it won't change anything.

317
00:24:55.497 --> 00:24:57.206
I love Hae Ra.

318
00:24:58.007 --> 00:24:59.567
I'll spend the rest
of my life with her.

319
00:25:02.476 --> 00:25:04.307
Don't say that to
me ever again.

320
00:25:05.476 --> 00:25:07.107
No, don't come to
see me ever again.

321
00:26:34.037 --> 00:26:35.497
I'll come to
retrieve it tomorrow.

322
00:26:36.936 --> 00:26:38.267
Thank you.

323
00:27:38.767 --> 00:27:39.966
Any good news?

324
00:27:40.426 --> 00:27:42.396
You are looking
very lively.

325
00:27:43.636 --> 00:27:46.206
I think my prayers are
about to come true.

326
00:27:48.237 --> 00:27:50.037
Becky wants to see you.

327
00:27:50.706 --> 00:27:52.247
She wants you
to come over.

328
00:27:57.047 --> 00:27:58.686
Hae Ra,
I'll be late tonight.

329
00:27:59.047 --> 00:28:01.987
Me too. I slacked off,
so I have to do overtime.

330
00:28:01.987 --> 00:28:03.186
Don't be too late.

331
00:28:03.186 --> 00:28:04.226
Okay.

332
00:28:04.226 --> 00:28:05.327
Oh, and...

333
00:28:05.987 --> 00:28:07.597
did you know that...

334
00:28:08.557 --> 00:28:10.297
Ms. Jang is a bit special?

335
00:28:11.166 --> 00:28:13.027
Why? Did something happen?

336
00:28:13.027 --> 00:28:14.037
Yes.

337
00:28:15.067 --> 00:28:16.097
What happened?

338
00:28:16.597 --> 00:28:18.237
I'll tell you
at home later.

339
00:28:18.267 --> 00:28:19.706
I hope
your work goes well.

340
00:28:19.936 --> 00:28:21.007
Okay.

341
00:28:37.827 --> 00:28:39.087
Come here,
and take a look.

342
00:28:54.277 --> 00:28:55.737
(Lady Seo Rin became
blinded with jealousy...)

343
00:28:55.737 --> 00:28:57.277
(and killed them
with fire.)

344
00:29:01.876 --> 00:29:03.416
I knew it.
The answer was...

345
00:29:04.317 --> 00:29:05.987
in Jeom Bok's prayer.

346
00:29:17.527 --> 00:29:21.237
It was my parents
who gave birth to me.

347
00:29:22.067 --> 00:29:25.237
But Boon Yi was the one
who gave me the light.

348
00:29:28.976 --> 00:29:30.547
That's done.

349
00:29:33.607 --> 00:29:34.847
- Hae Ra.
- Yes?

350
00:29:35.317 --> 00:29:36.347
Have some.

351
00:29:36.646 --> 00:29:37.747
Thanks.

352
00:29:41.257 --> 00:29:42.416
What's with you?

353
00:29:42.916 --> 00:29:45.757
She thought dearly
of a lowly man like me,

354
00:29:46.527 --> 00:29:49.196
and hated to see
my talent go to waste.

355
00:29:56.767 --> 00:29:58.966
Boon Yi was
so beautiful and kind.

356
00:30:03.436 --> 00:30:05.706
Her life perished
in the hands of...

357
00:30:05.706 --> 00:30:07.676
Choi Seo Rin, when her
fate changed with her.

358
00:30:09.277 --> 00:30:11.616
I am in
grief and mourning.

359
00:30:22.456 --> 00:30:24.366
I pray that...

360
00:30:24.997 --> 00:30:26.626
she will be granted
to be born again...

361
00:30:26.626 --> 00:30:28.097
to find her true love,

362
00:30:28.097 --> 00:30:30.466
Lee Myung So, to live
happily ever after.

363
00:30:32.237 --> 00:30:33.737
If Seo Rin does...

364
00:30:33.737 --> 00:30:36.037
anything wicked
in their next lives,

365
00:30:38.906 --> 00:30:41.017
let the mark of "A ghost
of the nether world"...

366
00:30:41.017 --> 00:30:42.547
cover her body,

367
00:30:43.376 --> 00:30:45.916
to protect the two people.

368
00:30:49.087 --> 00:30:51.087
How dare that
lowly slave do this?

369
00:30:53.726 --> 00:30:56.626
She must make
wedding gowns for them...

370
00:30:57.267 --> 00:30:59.567
with a wholesome heart.

371
00:31:02.166 --> 00:31:05.007
Myung So and Boon Yi
must get married...

372
00:31:05.767 --> 00:31:07.706
for Seo Rin
to purify her sins.

373
00:31:07.706 --> 00:31:10.077
That is when she will
finally rest in peace.

374
00:31:14.146 --> 00:31:16.116
How dare he do this to me?

375
00:31:17.317 --> 00:31:19.517
There is strong energy
with this prayer.

376
00:31:20.317 --> 00:31:23.216
You cannot do anything
wicked anymore, Sharon.

377
00:31:23.987 --> 00:31:25.426
My desperate heart...

378
00:31:25.426 --> 00:31:27.456
will win against
that petty slave's.

379
00:31:27.456 --> 00:31:28.656
Please stop!

380
00:31:28.656 --> 00:31:30.297
Why is nobody on my side?

381
00:31:30.497 --> 00:31:31.527
Why?

382
00:31:36.567 --> 00:31:37.717
Ms. Jang, what's

383
00:31:37.742 --> 00:31:38.460
going on?

384
00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:50.460
<font color="#80ffff">[Kocowa Ver] E16 Black Knight "One Last Wish"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

385
00:31:57.186 --> 00:31:58.257
Sharon!'

386
00:32:01.456 --> 00:32:03.896
Become a ghost of
the nether world...

387
00:32:04.966 --> 00:32:06.696
that wanders around
on this earth.

388
00:32:14.436 --> 00:32:15.777
What's wrong, Hae Ra?

389
00:32:17.307 --> 00:32:18.777
Did you just hear that?

390
00:32:18.777 --> 00:32:19.906
Hear what?

391
00:32:40.426 --> 00:32:41.636
Seo Rin.

392
00:32:44.737 --> 00:32:45.767
Seo Rin.

393
00:32:52.247 --> 00:32:53.747
Are you okay? Gosh.

394
00:33:00.386 --> 00:33:03.357
Please. I'm sorry.

395
00:33:04.527 --> 00:33:07.196
I am sorry. Please stop.

396
00:33:07.656 --> 00:33:08.827
Stop.

397
00:33:09.057 --> 00:33:11.466
Please forgive us.

398
00:33:25.376 --> 00:33:26.847
Shouldn't you go
to a hospital...

399
00:33:43.396 --> 00:33:44.966
What will you do now?

400
00:34:07.916 --> 00:34:09.287
Why just me?

401
00:34:40.146 --> 00:34:41.286
Ms. Jang.

402
00:34:43.987 --> 00:34:45.357
This picture...

403
00:34:46.686 --> 00:34:48.056
is true.

404
00:34:50.726 --> 00:34:52.297
(Lady Seo Rin
killed them with fire.)

405
00:34:59.936 --> 00:35:01.376
(Lady Seo Rin burned
Boon Yi's face...)

406
00:35:01.376 --> 00:35:02.737
(when she tried on
her wedding garment.)

407
00:35:25.226 --> 00:35:26.367
You can...

408
00:35:27.367 --> 00:35:29.036
wear this for a while.

409
00:35:30.637 --> 00:35:32.166
Let's make them...

410
00:35:32.166 --> 00:35:34.306
a wedding dress
and a dress suit.

411
00:35:35.737 --> 00:35:38.177
After you pick out fabric
and start sewing,

412
00:35:38.177 --> 00:35:40.007
these letters will
go away.

413
00:35:40.717 --> 00:35:42.777
Once they get married,

414
00:35:43.846 --> 00:35:45.686
your punishment
will be over.

415
00:35:48.956 --> 00:35:51.226
If I can't have him,

416
00:35:53.587 --> 00:35:56.527
what's the point of
entering time?

417
00:35:57.266 --> 00:35:58.326
It'll...

418
00:35:59.326 --> 00:36:01.867
put an end to your pain.

419
00:36:02.867 --> 00:36:04.567
Because you'll grow old
and die.

420
00:36:36.237 --> 00:36:37.467
Everything is...

421
00:36:38.107 --> 00:36:39.607
true.

422
00:36:42.237 --> 00:36:45.177
Myung So was
Seo Rin's husband.

423
00:36:45.507 --> 00:36:49.317
And Seo Rin killed
Myung So and Boon Yi.

424
00:36:50.076 --> 00:36:53.117
And as a punishment,
she's alive until now.

425
00:36:54.056 --> 00:36:56.016
It's up to you
to believe it or not.

426
00:36:56.757 --> 00:36:58.757
If you want to forget
about tonight,

427
00:37:00.257 --> 00:37:01.797
I'll help you forget it.

428
00:37:05.226 --> 00:37:06.226
No.

429
00:37:08.166 --> 00:37:09.867
Give me some time.

430
00:37:14.137 --> 00:37:16.876
It all started
with me...

431
00:37:17.777 --> 00:37:20.206
because I switched
the babies.

432
00:37:25.217 --> 00:37:26.646
Please forgive me.

433
00:37:28.456 --> 00:37:29.456
And...

434
00:37:29.686 --> 00:37:32.757
could you please
have mercy upon her...

435
00:37:32.757 --> 00:37:35.326
so she could be released
from her immortal curse?

436
00:37:37.226 --> 00:37:39.297
And get married in
Sharon's suit?

437
00:37:40.166 --> 00:37:42.237
I don't want to, ma'am.

438
00:37:51.376 --> 00:37:52.407
Ma'am.

439
00:37:53.976 --> 00:37:56.746
I will ask for
Hae Ra's forgiveness too.

440
00:37:58.516 --> 00:37:59.516
And could you please...

441
00:38:01.087 --> 00:38:04.556
think of all the prayers
I have made for you,

442
00:38:06.657 --> 00:38:09.996
and do this one favor
for me?

443
00:38:16.837 --> 00:38:18.036
I will.

444
00:38:20.876 --> 00:38:21.976
Thank you.

445
00:38:24.646 --> 00:38:25.677
I won't tell Hae Ra...

446
00:38:26.907 --> 00:38:28.677
about what happened
tonight.

447
00:39:38.447 --> 00:39:39.617
You came home late.

448
00:39:42.286 --> 00:39:43.286
Come here.

449
00:39:57.206 --> 00:39:58.637
Did something happen?

450
00:40:00.576 --> 00:40:01.607
Thank you.

451
00:40:04.306 --> 00:40:05.646
I love you, Hae Ra.

452
00:40:12.087 --> 00:40:13.317
Did you drink?

453
00:40:23.896 --> 00:40:25.166
Let's do as you wish.

454
00:40:26.626 --> 00:40:28.396
It doesn't matter...

455
00:40:28.396 --> 00:40:30.367
if we get married
in 2 years or 10 years.

456
00:40:30.867 --> 00:40:32.766
All I need is you
beside me.

457
00:40:40.646 --> 00:40:42.777
I gave it
some thought too.

458
00:40:45.617 --> 00:40:46.817
Let's get married
next year.

459
00:40:47.617 --> 00:40:49.257
But take wedding pictures
sooner...

460
00:40:49.257 --> 00:40:50.556
before we get any older.

461
00:40:52.456 --> 00:40:53.456
Okay.

462
00:40:53.956 --> 00:40:56.456
They say taking
wedding pictures is fun.

463
00:40:56.797 --> 00:40:58.027
Let's do it
right away then.

464
00:40:59.166 --> 00:41:00.697
Should we get
a wedding dress...

465
00:41:00.697 --> 00:41:02.367
from that shop
we went before?

466
00:41:04.806 --> 00:41:06.206
I'll prepare my suit
and your wedding dress...

467
00:41:06.206 --> 00:41:07.607
from a nice place.

468
00:41:08.036 --> 00:41:09.076
From where?

469
00:41:10.177 --> 00:41:11.677
I'll tell you later.

470
00:41:40.436 --> 00:41:43.476
I'm serious. It was
an awesome dream.

471
00:41:43.637 --> 00:41:44.846
I'll buy a lottery ticket.

472
00:41:45.746 --> 00:41:47.217
What will you do
if you win?

473
00:41:48.717 --> 00:41:50.177
I'll buy this house...

474
00:41:50.177 --> 00:41:52.246
and collect rent from you.

475
00:41:52.387 --> 00:41:53.487
I hope you win.

476
00:41:53.487 --> 00:41:54.717
I'll pay a lot of rent.

477
00:41:55.186 --> 00:41:58.556
You look so much
better today.

478
00:41:59.456 --> 00:42:00.797
She's right.

479
00:42:00.956 --> 00:42:02.797
Lately, you seemed
really tired.

480
00:42:03.357 --> 00:42:05.527
I think it's because
she had an awesome dream.

481
00:42:08.166 --> 00:42:09.697
Okay, then...

482
00:42:10.036 --> 00:42:11.407
I'll sleep 20 hours a day,

483
00:42:11.407 --> 00:42:12.936
and dream a lot of
awesome dreams.

484
00:42:17.746 --> 00:42:19.007
Eat some more.

485
00:42:21.717 --> 00:42:23.447
It was really shocking.

486
00:42:23.447 --> 00:42:25.087
I was totally shocked.

487
00:42:25.416 --> 00:42:26.947
A woman who can do
martial arts is cool.

488
00:42:26.947 --> 00:42:29.056
You should learn
from Ms. Jang.

489
00:42:29.387 --> 00:42:30.387
Should I?

490
00:42:31.226 --> 00:42:33.626
She also predicted
what kind of writing...

491
00:42:33.626 --> 00:42:36.427
would be found
from a grave.

492
00:42:36.427 --> 00:42:37.927
She studied history
a lot,

493
00:42:37.927 --> 00:42:39.567
so she can
talk about such stuff.

494
00:42:41.967 --> 00:42:43.936
Jang Bin hasn't
called yet,

495
00:42:43.936 --> 00:42:45.766
so it must've been
about something different.

496
00:42:47.237 --> 00:42:48.306
Never mind it.

497
00:42:59.516 --> 00:43:00.617
See you tonight.

498
00:43:01.516 --> 00:43:03.117
- Hae Ra.
- Yes?

499
00:43:03.117 --> 00:43:04.456
Aren't you forgetting
something?

500
00:43:11.697 --> 00:43:13.326
- Have a good day.
- That's not it.

501
00:43:16.237 --> 00:43:17.237
Have a good day.

502
00:43:18.407 --> 00:43:19.407
Bye.

503
00:43:23.107 --> 00:43:24.107
Bye.

504
00:43:34.157 --> 00:43:36.657
(Subpoena to Testify)

505
00:43:40.626 --> 00:43:41.626
Father.

506
00:43:44.797 --> 00:43:48.596
I've received
subpoenas before.

507
00:43:48.967 --> 00:43:50.467
It's nothing.

508
00:43:50.637 --> 00:43:52.607
As you run your business,

509
00:43:52.607 --> 00:43:54.337
you'll receive a few too.

510
00:43:54.907 --> 00:43:56.706
Don't worry about it.

511
00:44:00.246 --> 00:44:02.146
(Subpoena to Testify)

512
00:44:03.916 --> 00:44:05.286
Why did you get something
like this?

513
00:44:06.387 --> 00:44:07.617
I don't know also.

514
00:44:08.117 --> 00:44:09.186
I don't have to go, do I?

515
00:44:09.186 --> 00:44:11.157
I'm so scared to go.

516
00:44:13.686 --> 00:44:15.996
Did Soo Ho find out
about the text you sent?

517
00:44:17.226 --> 00:44:18.697
Why would that matter?

518
00:44:20.596 --> 00:44:21.666
Does he know?

519
00:44:25.206 --> 00:44:26.306
Why did you do that?

520
00:44:26.306 --> 00:44:27.936
That only made you
suspicious.

521
00:44:28.706 --> 00:44:31.007
I'll just say I did
something stupid...

522
00:44:31.007 --> 00:44:32.447
because I loved you.

523
00:44:32.447 --> 00:44:34.547
How about that?
That'll work, right?

524
00:44:34.846 --> 00:44:36.076
Look at me.

525
00:44:36.076 --> 00:44:39.547
I don't look like someone
who'd forge a scheme.

526
00:44:39.547 --> 00:44:41.317
Be quiet. Let me think.

527
00:44:45.456 --> 00:44:46.956
Do you want to
break up with me?

528
00:44:52.197 --> 00:44:53.197
Yes.

529
00:44:53.797 --> 00:44:56.197
I want to stop dating
an idiot like you.

530
00:45:00.607 --> 00:45:02.806
Your father
set the lab on fire.

531
00:45:03.277 --> 00:45:05.407
Your father killed
Hae Ra's dad too.

532
00:45:08.146 --> 00:45:10.016
I'll tell the prosecution
everything.

533
00:45:15.157 --> 00:45:16.217
What are you
talking about?

534
00:45:19.626 --> 00:45:20.626
Let me go.

535
00:45:22.896 --> 00:45:24.027
That was a lie.

536
00:46:40.007 --> 00:46:41.876
- Hello.
- Hae Ra.

537
00:46:45.777 --> 00:46:47.246
Your promotion...

538
00:46:49.646 --> 00:46:51.286
Congratulations!

539
00:46:53.087 --> 00:46:54.357
Congratulations!

540
00:46:54.357 --> 00:46:56.317
- Congrats.
- Congratulations!

541
00:46:56.516 --> 00:46:57.887
Goodness.

542
00:46:58.027 --> 00:46:59.157
Thank you.

543
00:46:59.157 --> 00:47:01.697
You know it's all thanks
to me. Be grateful.

544
00:47:03.226 --> 00:47:05.326
Congratulations, Hae Ra.

545
00:47:05.596 --> 00:47:06.596
Congratulations.

546
00:47:06.596 --> 00:47:09.536
- Good job, Hae Ra.
- Thank you.

547
00:47:10.867 --> 00:47:12.467
Let's have
a team dinner tonight.

548
00:47:12.467 --> 00:47:14.507
I'll treat you all
to dinner today.

549
00:47:17.076 --> 00:47:18.846
- Yes!
- Make it beef.

550
00:47:18.846 --> 00:47:20.346
- Beef.
- She's buying.

551
00:47:20.346 --> 00:47:21.516
How exciting.

552
00:47:23.576 --> 00:47:24.916
I can't wait.

553
00:47:25.617 --> 00:47:26.646
Great.

554
00:47:27.257 --> 00:47:28.587
- Sir.
- Yes?

555
00:47:28.587 --> 00:47:30.087
Are you going too?

556
00:47:30.487 --> 00:47:31.487
Am I not?

557
00:47:31.487 --> 00:47:34.197
Don't stick your nose in
at times like this.

558
00:47:34.496 --> 00:47:36.556
What do you mean? I'll
treat our eighth round.

559
00:47:36.556 --> 00:47:37.826
Make sure you come, sir.

560
00:47:37.826 --> 00:47:38.996
See?

561
00:47:40.697 --> 00:47:42.137
I'll go work outside then.

562
00:47:42.137 --> 00:47:44.337
All right, see you later.

563
00:47:44.907 --> 00:47:46.067
- Bye.
- Bye.

564
00:47:46.067 --> 00:47:47.737
Be careful with cars.

565
00:47:48.076 --> 00:47:49.837
- Are you insane?
- I'm still going.

566
00:48:41.927 --> 00:48:43.326
It's gone.

567
00:49:06.947 --> 00:49:10.016
(Blacksmith's)

568
00:49:10.016 --> 00:49:11.157
Hello.

569
00:49:11.157 --> 00:49:13.126
I brought the data
which you asked for.

570
00:49:13.126 --> 00:49:14.126
Thank you.

571
00:49:18.096 --> 00:49:19.126
Soo Ho.

572
00:49:19.126 --> 00:49:20.197
Congratulations.

573
00:49:24.067 --> 00:49:26.306
Congratulations,
Assistant Manager Jung.

574
00:49:26.907 --> 00:49:28.107
Thank you.

575
00:49:28.837 --> 00:49:31.146
I'm having
a team dinner tonight.

576
00:49:32.607 --> 00:49:34.576
Then I'll send you
10 bottles of wine.

577
00:49:34.576 --> 00:49:35.746
Go have some real fun.

578
00:49:36.177 --> 00:49:39.686
And I found a studio that
takes good wedding photos.

579
00:49:40.047 --> 00:49:41.087
When should we do it?

580
00:49:42.056 --> 00:49:43.516
After I lose
some more weight.

581
00:49:43.516 --> 00:49:44.757
After about a week?

582
00:49:44.757 --> 00:49:47.496
Okay. Let me hug
you one more time.

583
00:49:47.726 --> 00:49:48.956
Focus on your work, guys.

584
00:49:51.326 --> 00:49:52.726
You're getting a call.

585
00:49:52.726 --> 00:49:54.367
Get back to work now.
I'll see you at home.

586
00:49:54.936 --> 00:49:56.536
Get to work. Bye.

587
00:50:07.047 --> 00:50:08.076
Hello?

588
00:50:09.317 --> 00:50:11.217
Your wedding suit
and dress are complete.

589
00:50:11.916 --> 00:50:13.246
When will you
come pick them up?

590
00:50:13.617 --> 00:50:15.117
I'll stop by this evening.

591
00:50:15.516 --> 00:50:17.427
Please forget about
the other night.

592
00:50:20.496 --> 00:50:23.096
Forget about
everything now.

593
00:50:25.826 --> 00:50:27.067
I'm sorry.

594
00:50:28.737 --> 00:50:29.996
I'll see you later.

595
00:51:14.846 --> 00:51:16.516
Congratulations
on your wedding.

596
00:51:20.087 --> 00:51:21.357
What do you think?

597
00:51:22.617 --> 00:51:24.186
Do you like them?

598
00:51:27.297 --> 00:51:28.697
When is your wedding?

599
00:51:31.367 --> 00:51:33.126
We haven't decided
on that yet.

600
00:51:33.126 --> 00:51:34.596
We're taking
wedding photos first.

601
00:51:35.867 --> 00:51:37.206
That's also good.

602
00:51:39.306 --> 00:51:40.476
Please try it on.

603
00:52:12.166 --> 00:52:13.507
How pretty.

604
00:52:21.016 --> 00:52:22.646
Venues like this one
must be expensive.

605
00:52:24.286 --> 00:52:25.416
What are you doing?

606
00:52:26.916 --> 00:52:28.357
We might be late for
the team dinner. Let's go.

607
00:52:28.357 --> 00:52:29.817
Okay, let's go.

608
00:52:30.487 --> 00:52:31.757
- Are you done?
- Yes.

609
00:53:12.896 --> 00:53:15.137
I neither get old nor die.

610
00:53:16.396 --> 00:53:18.166
I can do everything...

611
00:53:19.766 --> 00:53:20.976
if it's not for
the fatal weakness...

612
00:53:20.976 --> 00:53:22.777
that I love you.

613
00:53:25.246 --> 00:53:26.706
Please don't do that.

614
00:53:26.706 --> 00:53:28.146
This will be the last.

615
00:53:31.887 --> 00:53:33.447
I'm giving up on you.

616
00:53:35.857 --> 00:53:37.286
I'm sorry for everything.

617
00:53:40.456 --> 00:53:42.427
I was your wife,

618
00:53:44.697 --> 00:53:46.867
but why can't I
be loved until the end?

619
00:53:48.297 --> 00:53:50.467
Why can't I have
you either?

620
00:53:52.107 --> 00:53:53.407
Let's not talk about it.

621
00:53:54.476 --> 00:53:56.407
I guess some things
can never be done.

622
00:54:00.817 --> 00:54:02.777
Hae Ra, let me pour
you one more drink.

623
00:54:02.777 --> 00:54:04.746
- Thank you.
- One more drink.

624
00:54:05.246 --> 00:54:06.646
You need to drink wine
in a beer glass.

625
00:54:06.646 --> 00:54:07.757
Right.

626
00:54:07.757 --> 00:54:10.016
Congratulations, Hae Ra.

627
00:54:10.826 --> 00:54:13.027
We had so much beef
thanks to you today.

628
00:54:13.027 --> 00:54:14.427
It's great.

629
00:54:14.427 --> 00:54:15.657
I hope you get promoted...

630
00:54:15.657 --> 00:54:17.726
to a team manager
and a chief director too.

631
00:54:17.726 --> 00:54:19.666
- Thank you.
- No.

632
00:54:20.027 --> 00:54:23.266
Women can't reach a
chief director position...

633
00:54:23.266 --> 00:54:25.436
because of marriage,

634
00:54:25.436 --> 00:54:27.137
childcare, and stuff.

635
00:54:27.137 --> 00:54:28.936
What nonsense are
you talking about?

636
00:54:28.936 --> 00:54:31.447
I'm working so hard to
become a chief director.

637
00:54:31.447 --> 00:54:32.576
I'm going for it.

638
00:54:32.576 --> 00:54:34.246
- Me too.
- Me too.

639
00:54:35.246 --> 00:54:38.887
Women in our company
are too strong-minded.

640
00:54:39.186 --> 00:54:41.617
I'll get you a designated
driver, so go home.

641
00:54:43.416 --> 00:54:45.487
- Assistant Manager Jung.
- Yes?

642
00:54:45.487 --> 00:54:47.027
What's that ring?

643
00:54:50.766 --> 00:54:51.996
It's a secret.

644
00:54:52.996 --> 00:54:55.567
You heard her, right?

645
00:54:56.266 --> 00:54:58.567
It's a secret that
Mr. Moon gave it to her.

646
00:54:59.137 --> 00:55:01.576
Everyone, it's a secret.

647
00:55:02.407 --> 00:55:04.007
Don't even mention
his name.

648
00:55:04.376 --> 00:55:05.607
Do you want a dish
of octopus?

649
00:55:05.607 --> 00:55:08.117
- Let's get that.
- Another dish.

650
00:55:08.146 --> 00:55:09.677
You have to go home
after this one.

651
00:55:09.677 --> 00:55:10.686
Okay.

652
00:55:26.367 --> 00:55:27.396
Please...

653
00:55:29.197 --> 00:55:30.666
kill me with this knife.

654
00:55:35.536 --> 00:55:37.346
Come to your senses,
Seo Rin.

655
00:55:37.346 --> 00:55:38.876
If you stab me,

656
00:55:39.947 --> 00:55:42.717
I think I can end
this painful life.

657
00:55:45.087 --> 00:55:46.447
Do it for me.

658
00:55:47.217 --> 00:55:49.387
I don't want to
do anything for you.

659
00:55:49.387 --> 00:55:51.757
I'm wearing this suit
for Ms. Jang's sake.

660
00:55:56.896 --> 00:55:59.626
You used to be
a very warm husband.

661
00:56:00.766 --> 00:56:02.797
You probably
didn't love me,

662
00:56:03.266 --> 00:56:04.936
but you didn't
hate me either.

663
00:56:05.867 --> 00:56:07.737
We were a great couple.

664
00:56:07.737 --> 00:56:09.507
That's the past
only you remember.

665
00:56:09.507 --> 00:56:11.107
I do not have
such a memory.

666
00:56:17.346 --> 00:56:18.416
Just...

667
00:56:20.387 --> 00:56:21.657
kill me.

668
00:56:27.226 --> 00:56:28.297
Move that knife.

669
00:56:28.326 --> 00:56:29.496
And get
a hold of yourself.

670
00:56:35.697 --> 00:56:37.266
Then just leave.

671
00:56:38.407 --> 00:56:40.036
I will stab myself.

672
00:56:42.007 --> 00:56:43.206
Now that I gave you two
those garments,

673
00:56:43.206 --> 00:56:44.777
I will grow old now.

674
00:56:46.076 --> 00:56:48.047
Very lonely,
as I always have been.

675
00:56:49.646 --> 00:56:50.686
Sounds great.

676
00:56:51.717 --> 00:56:55.117
Both Hae Ra and I will
never see you again.

677
00:56:56.556 --> 00:56:58.186
I know you don't love me.

678
00:56:59.887 --> 00:57:02.896
But can you pity me and
hold me in your arms?

679
00:57:07.367 --> 00:57:08.567
Like our old days?

680
00:57:09.396 --> 00:57:10.607
No.

681
00:57:13.536 --> 00:57:15.436
You are too harsh on me.

682
00:57:16.806 --> 00:57:18.777
Can't you just
hug me once?

683
00:57:21.916 --> 00:57:23.476
I will wait...

684
00:57:26.217 --> 00:57:29.087
until you are born again
as a man who'll love me.

685
00:59:09.757 --> 00:59:11.587
This wine is great.

686
00:59:12.257 --> 00:59:13.726
Do you know anything
about wine?

687
00:59:13.726 --> 00:59:15.596
This is...

688
00:59:20.166 --> 00:59:22.137
(Hae Ra)

689
00:59:24.737 --> 00:59:26.467
(Hae Ra)

690
00:59:50.467 --> 00:59:52.396
(Hae Ra)

691
00:59:57.806 --> 00:59:58.837
Hae Ra.

692
01:00:00.337 --> 01:00:01.337
(Hae Ra)

693
01:00:05.907 --> 01:00:08.217
(Hae Ra)
