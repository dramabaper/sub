1
00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:46.149
Right.

2
00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:54.519
Thank you for coming.

3
00:01:09.293 --> 00:01:11.324
It's been 7 or 8 years...

4
00:01:11.964 --> 00:01:13.224
since we met in the prosecution press room.

5
00:01:13.623 --> 00:01:14.864
Already?

6
00:01:15.135 --> 00:01:17.094
Tae Wook suddenly wanted to go play golf.

7
00:01:17.393 --> 00:01:18.634
I wondered why.

8
00:01:20.403 --> 00:01:21.733
It's been a while since we met, and...

9
00:01:22.274 --> 00:01:25.774
I thought it'd be even harder to see you once you enter the Blue House.

10
00:01:28.745 --> 00:01:31.784
The Blue House will have an official press release next Monday.

11
00:01:32.543 --> 00:01:35.054
Please keep the secret until then.

12
00:01:35.253 --> 00:01:36.414
Of course.

13
00:01:37.114 --> 00:01:38.283
Anyway, congratulations.

14
00:01:39.054 --> 00:01:40.054
Congratulations.

15
00:01:40.253 --> 00:01:42.524
I'm worried because he is in charge of great work.

16
00:01:43.253 --> 00:01:45.093
Please give him a hand.

17
00:01:46.393 --> 00:01:48.864
How can I help him?

18
00:01:48.994 --> 00:01:50.164
Honestly, it's a problem...

19
00:01:50.733 --> 00:01:53.033
how the press play smart these days.

20
00:01:53.464 --> 00:01:55.733
Whatever it is, they criticize first.

21
00:01:55.934 --> 00:01:57.334
Serving in politics is tough.

22
00:01:58.173 --> 00:01:59.173
Don't you agree?

23
00:02:00.444 --> 00:02:02.513
The press isn't the government's pet dog,

24
00:02:03.444 --> 00:02:04.684
but a watch dog.

25
00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:09.913
If you think News Nine would cover articles...

26
00:02:10.454 --> 00:02:13.984
you give and be scared, I'm sorry, but you wouldn't have...

27
00:02:14.623 --> 00:02:18.063
a good relationship with News Nine...

28
00:02:18.364 --> 00:02:20.223
while you stay in that position.

29
00:02:21.563 --> 00:02:24.294
Even if our situations are switched?

30
00:02:26.864 --> 00:02:27.934
What do you mean?

31
00:02:28.274 --> 00:02:29.304
For example,

32
00:02:30.403 --> 00:02:32.804
you might speak for the Blue House,

33
00:02:33.443 --> 00:02:35.674
or might become a party's spokesperson.

34
00:02:37.813 --> 00:02:39.114
Even if you speak for the Blue House...

35
00:02:40.144 --> 00:02:42.153
and speak for parties,

36
00:02:42.653 --> 00:02:45.454
are you confident that your belief will not change?

37
00:02:46.653 --> 00:02:47.653
That's what I mean.

38
00:02:49.723 --> 00:02:50.753
I'm not sure.

39
00:02:51.563 --> 00:02:54.264
This isn't about how confident you are.

40
00:02:55.394 --> 00:02:58.003
I think it's the matter of principles and belief.

41
00:02:59.003 --> 00:03:00.234
As far as I know,

42
00:03:00.764 --> 00:03:04.434
principles and belief stay the same regardless of the situation.

43
00:03:07.073 --> 00:03:08.073
Is that so?

44
00:03:08.073 --> 00:03:09.774
Don't think we only criticize.

45
00:03:10.443 --> 00:03:13.883
Think it as we continue to doubt and question you instead.

46
00:03:14.554 --> 00:03:15.853
Media and the politics are same...

47
00:03:16.454 --> 00:03:19.883
in a way that they both work for the people.

48
00:03:21.554 --> 00:03:22.554
I see.

49
00:03:23.394 --> 00:03:24.494
Duly noted.

50
00:03:26.163 --> 00:03:29.163
I'll take back what I said about criticizing.

51
00:03:29.994 --> 00:03:31.403
Keep being a watch dog...

52
00:03:32.464 --> 00:03:33.603
with principles and belief.

53
00:03:35.834 --> 00:03:37.774
Let's put aside the boring stuffs...

54
00:03:38.244 --> 00:03:39.973
and eat now. Enjoy.

55
00:03:40.443 --> 00:03:41.674
- Please. - Go ahead.

56
00:03:51.883 --> 00:03:53.383
How far do you want to go up?

57
00:03:54.153 --> 00:03:56.753
What? I can't hear you.

58
00:03:57.353 --> 00:03:58.894
You said you want to succeed.

59
00:03:59.193 --> 00:04:01.533
What's your definition of success?

60
00:04:06.133 --> 00:04:08.073
How should I put it?

61
00:04:09.903 --> 00:04:12.174
Until I can climb it.

62
00:04:13.103 --> 00:04:14.103
Where would that be?

63
00:04:15.644 --> 00:04:16.674
I don't know.

64
00:04:18.114 --> 00:04:20.914
I haven't reached it yet.

65
00:04:21.453 --> 00:04:24.383
Anyway, the highest I can reach.

66
00:04:24.753 --> 00:04:28.753
The highest I can reach as far as I can go.

67
00:04:31.823 --> 00:04:33.594
Why do you want to go up so high?

68
00:04:37.664 --> 00:04:39.763
The realization of a just society.

69
00:04:45.544 --> 00:04:47.804
Do I sound funny? You think it's funny?

70
00:04:48.643 --> 00:04:50.713
- No. - You laughed at me.

71
00:04:51.513 --> 00:04:53.184
You just laughed, didn't you?

72
00:04:53.443 --> 00:04:54.554
I said I didn't.

73
00:04:55.354 --> 00:04:56.383
Wait and see.

74
00:04:57.813 --> 00:04:59.724
Wait and see...

75
00:05:00.523 --> 00:05:01.753
if I can do it.

76
00:05:02.453 --> 00:05:03.453
Okay?

77
00:05:07.563 --> 00:05:08.563
I love you.

78
00:05:16.474 --> 00:05:17.474
Let's get married.

79
00:05:23.174 --> 00:05:25.344
- Crazy punk. - Let's get married.

80
00:05:25.344 --> 00:05:26.984
I'm not going to do that.

81
00:05:27.844 --> 00:05:31.854
How many times do I need to reject for you to understand?

82
00:05:32.154 --> 00:05:33.154
I'm...

83
00:05:33.953 --> 00:05:36.693
not going to get married. No.

84
00:05:36.994 --> 00:05:39.623
I have so many dreams,

85
00:05:40.164 --> 00:05:42.994
and I have so much to do.

86
00:05:43.263 --> 00:05:45.963
I love you, Reporter Go Hye Ran.

87
00:05:45.963 --> 00:05:47.604
I mean, why me?

88
00:05:47.974 --> 00:05:49.534
I have got nothing.

89
00:05:50.034 --> 00:05:52.073
I'm not even that pretty.

90
00:05:52.174 --> 00:05:55.643
I have a nasty personality, and I'm greedy.

91
00:05:55.914 --> 00:05:57.513
I'm also selfish.

92
00:05:58.443 --> 00:06:02.614
I might treat you nothing more than a fancy business card.

93
00:06:03.654 --> 00:06:07.424
Why me? Why do you like me?

94
00:06:10.994 --> 00:06:13.393
Because you're the only reporter who calls...

95
00:06:13.393 --> 00:06:15.693
Korean prosecutor a crazy punk.

96
00:06:18.104 --> 00:06:21.133
And I'm the only prosecutor who'd laugh at it.

97
00:06:25.344 --> 00:06:26.373
I will...

98
00:06:28.273 --> 00:06:29.273
be your fancy business card.

99
00:06:32.813 --> 00:06:35.784
However you want to look, I can do that for you.

100
00:06:37.513 --> 00:06:38.554
I promise.

101
00:07:46.184 --> 00:07:47.184
Aren't you tired?

102
00:07:49.654 --> 00:07:51.924
I didn't expect you to come all the way here.

103
00:07:53.263 --> 00:07:54.263
Thank you.

104
00:07:56.864 --> 00:07:58.133
I thought you wanted to become a spokesperson.

105
00:07:59.404 --> 00:08:00.904
Isn't that why you couldn't get divorced with me?

106
00:08:05.174 --> 00:08:06.904
Try what you want to do.

107
00:08:08.114 --> 00:08:11.583
What you wanted from me was my background in the first place.

108
00:08:12.713 --> 00:08:15.083
I promised I'd give it to you, so I better keep it.

109
00:08:20.054 --> 00:08:21.184
I thought...

110
00:08:22.994 --> 00:08:25.623
you came here to make up with me.

111
00:08:27.463 --> 00:08:28.693
Is it...

112
00:08:30.434 --> 00:08:32.003
even possible anymore?

113
00:08:40.804 --> 00:08:41.813
Goodnight.

114
00:09:09.603 --> 00:09:11.004
Hello. Give them to me.

115
00:09:11.573 --> 00:09:12.573
Thank you.

116
00:09:14.203 --> 00:09:16.213
Why did you go alone? You should've called me.

117
00:09:16.644 --> 00:09:17.644
It's all right.

118
00:09:32.664 --> 00:09:35.034
He's Go Hye Ran's husband.

119
00:09:36.794 --> 00:09:38.664
- What? - He came here...

120
00:09:38.664 --> 00:09:40.063
with his company all of a sudden in the afternoon.

121
00:09:40.404 --> 00:09:43.174
He's a former prosecutor and a current attorney or something.

122
00:09:43.904 --> 00:09:45.544
Isn't he so handsome by the way?

123
00:09:47.743 --> 00:09:48.743
I see.

124
00:09:49.174 --> 00:09:51.174
I'm so envious of him for being Hye Ran's husband.

125
00:09:52.784 --> 00:09:55.384
Did you see Hye Ran's husband too?

126
00:09:55.953 --> 00:09:59.554
I heard he's a former prosecutor, so I expected he'd be stiff.

127
00:10:00.083 --> 00:10:04.024
But he seems gentle and decent.

128
00:10:04.693 --> 00:10:07.063
I could tell he grew up in a wealthy family.

129
00:10:08.634 --> 00:10:10.394
And he's handsome too.

130
00:10:12.463 --> 00:10:15.434
That brat is lucky with men after all.

131
00:10:16.603 --> 00:10:18.073
How about we ask them to have dinner together tomorrow?

132
00:10:18.073 --> 00:10:19.703
No. I don't have time for that.

133
00:10:25.613 --> 00:10:26.943
How do you feel today?

134
00:10:28.154 --> 00:10:29.713
I'm okay. It's gotten much better now.

135
00:10:34.894 --> 00:10:36.254
Do you want to go for a walk?

136
00:10:37.794 --> 00:10:39.193
Sure.

137
00:11:13.193 --> 00:11:15.034
It all looks ridiculous to you, doesn't it?

138
00:11:16.363 --> 00:11:19.164
I'm crazily obsessed with success, fame, and power.

139
00:11:21.573 --> 00:11:22.874
And you think I'm so materialistic, don't you?

140
00:11:24.134 --> 00:11:26.573
You think I'm pathetic...

141
00:11:27.443 --> 00:11:29.973
to risk everything and go after being the spokesperson, don't you?

142
00:11:33.144 --> 00:11:34.284
Still, it can't be helped.

143
00:11:35.453 --> 00:11:36.914
I won't stop.

144
00:11:39.223 --> 00:11:42.093
Whether it's obsession or not, I'll succeed no matter what.

145
00:11:43.493 --> 00:11:46.394
Wherever it is, I'll climb until the end.

146
00:11:48.193 --> 00:11:49.764
Though you're embarrassed by how pathetic I am...

147
00:11:50.634 --> 00:11:53.404
Though it doesn't cope with the elegant personality of yours,

148
00:11:57.943 --> 00:11:58.943
you have to put up with it.

149
00:12:00.644 --> 00:12:02.073
You're my husband,

150
00:12:04.073 --> 00:12:05.943
and you promised that you'd do it.

151
00:12:10.054 --> 00:12:12.554
You came all the way here to keep that promise.

152
00:12:15.394 --> 00:12:16.394
Well?

153
00:12:25.703 --> 00:12:26.863
Sleep at home.

154
00:12:28.004 --> 00:12:29.374
There are eyes watching us.

155
00:12:30.274 --> 00:12:32.973
I'll sleep on the sofa.

156
00:12:36.313 --> 00:12:38.713
I'll take care of it, so don't even bother.

157
00:12:42.453 --> 00:12:43.453
Hye Ran.

158
00:13:18.483 --> 00:13:22.693
(Episode 4: Bottomless Pit)

159
00:13:23.593 --> 00:13:26.124
We were best friends throughout our high school lives.

160
00:13:26.593 --> 00:13:29.134
We shared everything...

161
00:13:29.134 --> 00:13:32.434
including secrets which we couldn't tell others.

162
00:13:33.264 --> 00:13:35.374
Hye Ran and I were that close.

163
00:13:36.573 --> 00:13:37.573
Right, Hye Ran?

164
00:13:38.943 --> 00:13:41.343
You met such a decent husband.

165
00:13:42.514 --> 00:13:45.044
I'm so happy for you. Aren't you, honey?

166
00:13:50.284 --> 00:13:51.884
Are you okay, honey?

167
00:13:52.884 --> 00:13:55.794
You must be tired. You can go inside first.

168
00:13:55.794 --> 00:13:57.823
Really? Are you tired?

169
00:13:58.063 --> 00:13:59.593
No, I'm fine.

170
00:14:01.664 --> 00:14:02.664
I'm okay.

171
00:14:11.904 --> 00:14:13.943
- Can I pour you a drink? - Sure.

172
00:14:28.693 --> 00:14:32.024
It's not easy to love a woman with a successful career.

173
00:14:32.924 --> 00:14:33.963
Don't you agree?

174
00:14:37.563 --> 00:14:40.004
It was the same with the woman whom I met a long time ago.

175
00:14:40.804 --> 00:14:42.034
I was unsuccessful...

176
00:14:42.573 --> 00:14:44.174
and had no future at that time.

177
00:14:45.404 --> 00:14:46.904
But she had everything.

178
00:14:47.874 --> 00:14:49.374
She had a definite life's goal.

179
00:14:50.243 --> 00:14:52.514
She was sure with what she wanted to do and have.

180
00:14:56.754 --> 00:14:57.754
So she dumped me.

181
00:14:58.723 --> 00:15:00.754
I lost to a successful man...

182
00:15:01.124 --> 00:15:03.124
with an outstanding background,

183
00:15:04.424 --> 00:15:05.424
so to speak.

184
00:15:10.034 --> 00:15:11.034
I see.

185
00:15:12.103 --> 00:15:13.733
I met my wife then.

186
00:15:14.134 --> 00:15:16.103
While I was at the bottom of my life,

187
00:15:19.674 --> 00:15:21.914
she held my hands.

188
00:15:23.473 --> 00:15:26.144
Thank you, and I love you.

189
00:15:31.853 --> 00:15:34.024
I'd better leave now. I'm a bit tired.

190
00:15:36.124 --> 00:15:39.723
Are you? Let's leave then.

191
00:15:43.394 --> 00:15:44.394
You are not coming with me?

192
00:15:45.063 --> 00:15:47.534
You have to play golf from early in the morning tomorrow.

193
00:15:49.404 --> 00:15:50.404
I'll join you later.

194
00:15:51.603 --> 00:15:54.374
- Honey. - How about we have some more?

195
00:16:03.414 --> 00:16:04.414
Why not?

196
00:16:13.063 --> 00:16:14.063
I'm glad.

197
00:16:14.193 --> 00:16:16.993
Jae Young and your husband seem to get along well together.

198
00:16:18.963 --> 00:16:21.573
Do you want to have some tea while they have more drinks?

199
00:16:22.174 --> 00:16:24.843
Later. I need some rest.

200
00:16:25.274 --> 00:16:28.144
Sure thing. You said you are tired.

201
00:16:28.274 --> 00:16:29.374
I forgot.

202
00:16:29.843 --> 00:16:32.514
You must've been very tired for shooting all day.

203
00:16:34.713 --> 00:16:37.154
- Get some rest. - I'll see you tomorrow.

204
00:16:37.453 --> 00:16:38.453
Bye.

205
00:16:52.504 --> 00:16:55.304
So what happened?

206
00:16:56.504 --> 00:16:58.743
As you can see, things have changed completely.

207
00:17:00.404 --> 00:17:02.414
I'm back as a successful man.

208
00:17:03.674 --> 00:17:05.314
It means if I put my mind to it,

209
00:17:07.684 --> 00:17:11.753
I can meet her or sleep with her at any time.

210
00:17:15.493 --> 00:17:19.263
How can you have such thought when you have a wife?

211
00:17:22.434 --> 00:17:24.033
Come on. Don't act naive.

212
00:17:26.664 --> 00:17:28.803
I love and respect Eun Joo as my wife.

213
00:17:29.574 --> 00:17:31.443
But marriage is only marriage.

214
00:17:33.043 --> 00:17:35.043
It's a totally different matter...

215
00:17:36.874 --> 00:17:38.884
that a man and a woman are attracted by each other sexually.

216
00:17:40.213 --> 00:17:41.213
Don't you think so?

217
00:20:14.064 --> 00:20:15.074
Good shot.

218
00:20:18.803 --> 00:20:19.973
Relax, okay?

219
00:20:26.283 --> 00:20:27.543
Nice shot!

220
00:20:27.543 --> 00:20:28.953
You still got it.

221
00:20:31.154 --> 00:20:32.424
By the way, your wife...

222
00:20:33.023 --> 00:20:34.824
She's good at everything.

223
00:20:35.953 --> 00:20:39.493
She's too talented to be stuck in the newsroom.

224
00:20:40.064 --> 00:20:41.463
Don't you think so?

225
00:20:42.664 --> 00:20:43.664
Wait up!

226
00:20:53.674 --> 00:20:56.674
Today, the Blue House announced its second lineup of new hires...

227
00:20:56.674 --> 00:20:58.614
that includes Prosecutor Yoon Ho Young...

228
00:20:58.614 --> 00:21:00.543
from the Central District Prosecutors' Office.

229
00:21:02.483 --> 00:21:03.483
The former prosecutor Yoon Ho Young...

230
00:21:03.483 --> 00:21:06.154
A new senior secretary of public affairs means a complete changeover.

231
00:21:06.154 --> 00:21:07.654
He has retired from the prosecution and...

232
00:21:07.654 --> 00:21:11.053
Rumor has it that Dae Yong from GBS has been hired as a spokesperson.

233
00:21:12.064 --> 00:21:14.223
Do you know what kind of people I despise the most?

234
00:21:14.564 --> 00:21:15.664
The President's...

235
00:21:15.664 --> 00:21:19.364
It's those who get into politics using fame from the media industry.

236
00:21:19.864 --> 00:21:22.273
You know those who act like trumpet players, right? I hate them.

237
00:21:22.273 --> 00:21:23.434
Oh, is that right?

238
00:21:23.904 --> 00:21:26.443
The Blue House has started appointing...

239
00:21:26.443 --> 00:21:27.604
Camera two, be on standby!

240
00:21:28.243 --> 00:21:30.743
Camera two. Cut. Cue!

241
00:21:31.283 --> 00:21:34.884
I heard he's proven clean in terms of assets and tax evasion history.

242
00:21:35.684 --> 00:21:37.854
Your husband is a man of integrity, you know.

243
00:21:38.053 --> 00:21:40.023
They dug hard but couldn't find any dirt on him.

244
00:21:41.953 --> 00:21:44.894
He left the prosecution to be a public defender...

245
00:21:44.894 --> 00:21:46.424
just before he could get promoted.

246
00:21:46.894 --> 00:21:49.334
Who knew that would end up being so helpful to us?

247
00:21:53.864 --> 00:21:55.533
I got a little gift for you at the duty-free shop.

248
00:22:04.414 --> 00:22:05.443
From now on,

249
00:22:06.644 --> 00:22:08.513
they'll focus on your personal life,

250
00:22:09.354 --> 00:22:11.523
from your relationship with your husband to everyone around you.

251
00:22:12.684 --> 00:22:14.424
Make sure there's nothing problematic.

252
00:22:16.854 --> 00:22:18.324
Hey, you're almost there.

253
00:22:18.963 --> 00:22:19.963
Stay strong, okay?

254
00:22:57.463 --> 00:22:58.463
Honey.

255
00:22:59.463 --> 00:23:00.503
Are you going somewhere?

256
00:23:01.233 --> 00:23:03.003
I'll stay at my office for the next little while.

257
00:23:04.074 --> 00:23:05.203
What do you mean?

258
00:23:06.273 --> 00:23:07.273
Why all of a sudden?

259
00:23:11.713 --> 00:23:14.384
I left your brooch on the dining table.

260
00:23:15.684 --> 00:23:16.713
Kevin Lee...

261
00:23:17.553 --> 00:23:19.184
asked me to give it to you.

262
00:24:13.344 --> 00:24:14.674
Oh, I forgot about this.

263
00:24:17.144 --> 00:24:18.783
She dropped this when she was with me earlier.

264
00:24:21.483 --> 00:24:22.814
Both of us were out of it.

265
00:24:27.684 --> 00:24:29.424
Please give this to Ms. Go Hye Ran.

266
00:25:27.043 --> 00:25:30.154
From now on, they'll focus on your personal life,

267
00:25:30.154 --> 00:25:32.354
from your relationship with your husband to everyone around you.

268
00:25:33.624 --> 00:25:35.253
Make sure there's nothing problematic.

269
00:25:35.253 --> 00:25:37.453
If we didn't meet again, it'd be your past.

270
00:25:37.553 --> 00:25:38.594
But that's not the case.

271
00:25:38.624 --> 00:25:40.124
Is it still possible...

272
00:25:40.624 --> 00:25:42.263
to patch up our marriage?

273
00:26:05.783 --> 00:26:06.953
You look great in it.

274
00:26:16.634 --> 00:26:20.634
By the way, aren't you taking too long of a break from exercising?

275
00:26:21.503 --> 00:26:23.973
You should start working out again to get back into shape.

276
00:26:25.773 --> 00:26:26.904
I'll figure out what to do.

277
00:26:35.013 --> 00:26:37.114
What's wrong? What's bothering you?

278
00:26:40.684 --> 00:26:42.023
Let's have a baby.

279
00:26:43.624 --> 00:26:45.324
We've been putting it off, saying we'd wait...

280
00:26:45.664 --> 00:26:46.963
until we'll have our own place...

281
00:26:47.523 --> 00:26:48.834
and until you win.

282
00:26:49.463 --> 00:26:50.634
10 years went by like that.

283
00:26:52.364 --> 00:26:53.803
We aren't young anymore, you know.

284
00:26:56.674 --> 00:26:58.344
Let's have a baby, Jae Young.

285
00:27:02.773 --> 00:27:04.273
(Blocked Caller ID)

286
00:27:11.146 --> 00:27:14.245
- Hello? - What do you think you're doing?

287
00:27:18.746 --> 00:27:21.845
- Hello? - What do you think you're doing?

288
00:27:29.902 --> 00:27:31.573
I'm with my wife.

289
00:27:31.573 --> 00:27:34.412
- Unless it's urgent... - You piece of trash!

290
00:27:35.283 --> 00:27:36.283
Hold on, please.

291
00:27:46.753 --> 00:27:47.793
Listen.

292
00:27:49.462 --> 00:27:51.662
What are you doing?

293
00:27:51.993 --> 00:27:53.192
Do you want Eun Joo to find out?

294
00:27:53.233 --> 00:27:55.432
If you're afraid of her finding out,

295
00:27:55.632 --> 00:27:57.702
what have you done to my husband?

296
00:27:58.073 --> 00:28:00.273
Will you keep being nasty?

297
00:28:00.533 --> 00:28:04.343
Do you think I would care if you act like this?

298
00:28:04.372 --> 00:28:07.813
Did he hand you the brooch already?

299
00:28:09.243 --> 00:28:12.952
Your husband seems much more innocent than I thought.

300
00:28:13.952 --> 00:28:16.852
Did he not understand me or is he pretending not to?

301
00:28:16.852 --> 00:28:19.753
Don't be mistaken that I'll be the only one who'll fall to the bottom.

302
00:28:19.952 --> 00:28:21.622
Once something goes wrong,

303
00:28:22.093 --> 00:28:24.462
you'll also fall mercilessly.

304
00:28:24.462 --> 00:28:26.033
That's not bad either.

305
00:28:26.533 --> 00:28:29.602
After losing everything that we have,

306
00:28:30.733 --> 00:28:32.073
we will hit the bottom.

307
00:28:33.773 --> 00:28:35.503
Then we can go back to our life 10 years ago.

308
00:28:35.872 --> 00:28:37.912
You're insane.

309
00:28:39.073 --> 00:28:43.083
I'm warning you. Don't think about showing up before me.

310
00:28:43.083 --> 00:28:44.682
Don't even step on my shadow.

311
00:28:44.912 --> 00:28:47.952
Don't you dare pull tricks on Tae Wook or anyone else...

312
00:28:48.283 --> 00:28:49.983
around me.

313
00:28:49.983 --> 00:28:51.122
If I do?

314
00:28:51.323 --> 00:28:54.253
Otherwise, I'll kill you.

315
00:29:19.277 --> 00:29:24.277
<font color="#fcc89b">[VIU Ver] jTBC E04 Misty "Bottomless Pit"</font>
<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

316
00:29:50.343 --> 00:29:51.352
Clean up.

317
00:30:02.063 --> 00:30:03.892
Will he be released this time?

318
00:30:05.563 --> 00:30:06.793
I mean Han Young Ho.

319
00:30:07.833 --> 00:30:11.132
Who knows what trouble he'll cause this time?

320
00:32:13.223 --> 00:32:15.263
It's so cold. What?

321
00:32:20.533 --> 00:32:22.563
Attorney Kang?

322
00:32:27.602 --> 00:32:28.843
What time is it?

323
00:32:29.273 --> 00:32:32.313
It's a little after 8am. Did you sleep here?

324
00:32:32.313 --> 00:32:34.172
Yes, I had something to review.

325
00:32:35.182 --> 00:32:36.313
Did you...

326
00:32:37.083 --> 00:32:38.712
fight with your wife?

327
00:32:39.283 --> 00:32:42.523
Didn't you go to Thailand with your wife yesterday?

328
00:32:42.523 --> 00:32:44.892
Did you visit Kaham yesterday?

329
00:32:45.293 --> 00:32:46.323
What did you fight about?

330
00:32:46.323 --> 00:32:50.192
No matter how bad it was, you shouldn't sleep away from home.

331
00:32:56.102 --> 00:32:57.102
Hello.

332
00:33:03.303 --> 00:33:04.513
He was working all night.

333
00:33:05.212 --> 00:33:07.642
I brought him some food. Please have some.

334
00:33:08.083 --> 00:33:10.683
No, I already had breakfast. Enjoy it together.

335
00:33:10.783 --> 00:33:11.913
I'll get going.

336
00:33:11.913 --> 00:33:14.553
I'll look for human rights attorney first.

337
00:33:14.853 --> 00:33:18.553
Can you look for other labor workers with similar cases?

338
00:33:19.453 --> 00:33:21.053
They won't testify.

339
00:33:21.093 --> 00:33:24.862
They won't testify against their boss who pays them.

340
00:33:25.033 --> 00:33:28.263
Some of them may have changed their mind.

341
00:33:28.433 --> 00:33:29.533
Please continue searching.

342
00:33:39.413 --> 00:33:41.482
Why don't you eat some? I'll leave it.

343
00:33:41.982 --> 00:33:44.453
It's okay. You worked hard to make it.

344
00:33:45.152 --> 00:33:46.553
Then I'll have some.

345
00:33:46.953 --> 00:33:48.823
(Kaham Unpaid Wage Case)

346
00:33:49.882 --> 00:33:51.192
This is precious.

347
00:33:53.123 --> 00:33:55.163
(Kaham Unpaid Wage Case)

348
00:33:59.232 --> 00:34:01.132
It's the Kaham Case.

349
00:34:02.163 --> 00:34:04.732
It's what keeps Attorney Kang busy.

350
00:34:05.172 --> 00:34:07.973
The defendant is a huge corporation.

351
00:34:11.172 --> 00:34:12.243
Hwanil Steel?

352
00:34:12.243 --> 00:34:15.882
They had a problem with foreign laborers few years ago.

353
00:34:15.882 --> 00:34:17.783
It was on the news script,

354
00:34:17.783 --> 00:34:20.152
but it was dramatically settled before the broadcast.

355
00:34:20.152 --> 00:34:21.882
It wasn't reported in the end.

356
00:34:23.252 --> 00:34:27.053
Can you search the reporter and see if there are related footages?

357
00:34:27.053 --> 00:34:29.123
Please give me a break.

358
00:34:29.493 --> 00:34:31.362
I've been working two nights in a row after Thailand.

359
00:34:31.893 --> 00:34:34.332
Kevin Lee wanted to see the edited video,

360
00:34:34.462 --> 00:34:37.332
- so I have to finish it by today. - We work few nights for it,

361
00:34:37.332 --> 00:34:39.232
but someone's life depends on it.

362
00:34:39.573 --> 00:34:42.573
He wasn't paid for a year only because he's a foreign worker.

363
00:34:42.573 --> 00:34:44.942
He's locked up because he's suspected for violence.

364
00:34:45.442 --> 00:34:46.542
Will you ignore it?

365
00:34:47.542 --> 00:34:48.542
Will you?

366
00:34:49.913 --> 00:34:51.252
When will you release it?

367
00:34:52.783 --> 00:34:54.853
Tonight. Thank you in advance.

368
00:34:57.623 --> 00:34:59.453
Senior Manager Oh will get upset again.

369
00:35:09.433 --> 00:35:11.502
Move out of the way.

370
00:35:12.632 --> 00:35:16.002
Gosh, there you are, the frightening lady.

371
00:35:22.143 --> 00:35:23.643
Did you get the script from Reporter Kwak?

372
00:35:23.643 --> 00:35:24.712
Yes.

373
00:35:25.183 --> 00:35:27.612
It was so surprising that...

374
00:35:28.123 --> 00:35:30.623
my head is about to explode.

375
00:35:31.379 --> 00:35:33.779
Only the content of the segment will change.

376
00:35:34.009 --> 00:35:36.679
I organized the script to fit the time.

377
00:35:36.679 --> 00:35:38.489
Isn't this what you said before?

378
00:35:40.618 --> 00:35:43.188
Is news a game?

379
00:35:43.558 --> 00:35:46.659
You added what the anchor didn't know before the live news.

380
00:35:47.029 --> 00:35:49.299
You sent away promising Han Ji Won...

381
00:35:49.299 --> 00:35:51.168
all the way to Daejeon.

382
00:35:52.668 --> 00:35:55.098
You added what we didn't know at the desk?

383
00:35:55.799 --> 00:35:57.739
Where do you want to go? Jeju Island?

384
00:35:57.839 --> 00:35:59.138
Do you want some fresh air?

385
00:35:59.839 --> 00:36:01.239
I'll take the responsibility...

386
00:36:01.609 --> 00:36:03.239
if it becomes a problem.

387
00:36:03.239 --> 00:36:04.339
How?

388
00:36:04.909 --> 00:36:06.248
Will you step down from your position?

389
00:36:09.379 --> 00:36:12.418
Do you want to take me down from this position that much?

390
00:36:12.518 --> 00:36:14.688
Yes, please.

391
00:36:15.188 --> 00:36:17.159
That's my only wish.

392
00:36:17.288 --> 00:36:20.089
Your wish might get granted, right?

393
00:36:32.339 --> 00:36:34.578
- Five minutes. - I know.

394
00:36:38.248 --> 00:36:39.848
Here's the intro song.

395
00:36:47.518 --> 00:36:51.228
The number you have dialed is not available at this moment.

396
00:36:52.058 --> 00:36:53.859
(My Husband)

397
00:36:58.168 --> 00:37:00.228
(Eun Joo)

398
00:37:12.879 --> 00:37:15.779
(Eun Joo)

399
00:37:19.649 --> 00:37:21.458
Your wife is impressive.

400
00:37:22.219 --> 00:37:24.089
You already have six missed calls from her.

401
00:37:26.429 --> 00:37:27.429
You came out nicely.

402
00:37:28.058 --> 00:37:29.929
You got paid a million dollars after shooting a few seconds of that?

403
00:37:30.399 --> 00:37:33.268
Come on. It took a day to film that commercial.

404
00:37:33.268 --> 00:37:34.998
And you got paid a million dollars.

405
00:37:35.969 --> 00:37:37.638
It's so easy to earn money.

406
00:37:39.268 --> 00:37:40.839
Hello, viewers.

407
00:37:40.969 --> 00:37:43.438
- I'm Go Hye Ran of News Nine. - How annoying.

408
00:37:44.549 --> 00:37:48.449
"It's such a pain not being able to get treated because of no money."

409
00:37:49.018 --> 00:37:50.918
The president made this comment...

410
00:37:50.918 --> 00:37:52.848
as he announced the strengthening regulation on health insurance.

411
00:37:53.248 --> 00:37:54.788
Except for plastic surgeries...

412
00:37:54.788 --> 00:37:58.058
(Eun Joo)

413
00:37:58.759 --> 00:38:00.759
Reporters Kim Soo Hyun and Lee Haeng...

414
00:38:00.759 --> 00:38:03.259
will report about how health care regulations will change...

415
00:38:03.498 --> 00:38:06.228
when it takes place.

416
00:38:09.368 --> 00:38:10.799
(My husband)

417
00:38:42.069 --> 00:38:44.138
The freezing weather is sweeping over the entire country.

418
00:38:44.538 --> 00:38:45.808
As the cold weather...

419
00:38:45.808 --> 00:38:46.909
- Okay. - continues,

420
00:38:47.069 --> 00:38:49.138
tomorrow will be the coldest day in this winter.

421
00:38:49.779 --> 00:38:52.449
The weather in Seoul will go down to minus 15°C.

422
00:38:52.679 --> 00:38:55.319
Mountain areas will be lower than that.

423
00:38:56.679 --> 00:38:57.719
Goodness.

424
00:39:02.859 --> 00:39:03.859
Gosh.

425
00:39:04.759 --> 00:39:06.989
It's packed nicely.

426
00:39:07.788 --> 00:39:09.429
I wonder what's inside.

427
00:39:24.649 --> 00:39:26.279
- You're here. - Hi.

428
00:39:26.779 --> 00:39:29.779
I was so busy with work and just prepared myself some ramyeon.

429
00:39:29.779 --> 00:39:31.049
Do you want some too?

430
00:39:31.118 --> 00:39:32.848
- No, thank you. - Okay.

431
00:39:34.418 --> 00:39:36.219
Gosh, I guess I'm having a cold.

432
00:39:36.219 --> 00:39:38.759
They believe that they can support their family in their home country.

433
00:39:39.888 --> 00:39:41.159
But in return,

434
00:39:41.159 --> 00:39:43.629
they were mistreated...

435
00:39:44.228 --> 00:39:47.768
for not knowing the Korean language.

436
00:39:48.969 --> 00:39:50.299
Ramyeon is the best.

437
00:39:50.538 --> 00:39:53.938
It's a story of Kaham who didn't get paid for his payment for a year...

438
00:39:54.368 --> 00:39:56.679
and was arrested for assault.

439
00:39:59.708 --> 00:40:02.478
He doesn't know the Chinese letters for probation.

440
00:40:04.248 --> 00:40:06.819
That's why he wrote a statement as he was told to.

441
00:40:07.219 --> 00:40:08.219
Then he signed it.

442
00:40:09.259 --> 00:40:12.728
This 27-year-old man was honest and hardworking,

443
00:40:13.589 --> 00:40:15.129
but he became a criminal.

444
00:40:16.699 --> 00:40:19.228
The amount of the payment which he didn't get paid for a year...

445
00:40:19.598 --> 00:40:21.199
is 18,000 dollars in total.

446
00:40:22.268 --> 00:40:26.638
It's said that this company gladly paid a million dollars...

447
00:40:27.268 --> 00:40:30.638
to sign a contract with a famous golfer recently.

448
00:40:30.978 --> 00:40:32.679
Isn't it about Hwanil Steel?

449
00:40:35.149 --> 00:40:37.989
Before spending that amount of money for its image,

450
00:40:38.888 --> 00:40:40.449
shouldn't they have wiped...

451
00:40:41.149 --> 00:40:45.259
the resentful tears of this employee who worked hard for the company?

452
00:40:47.328 --> 00:40:50.129
This is the end of the Anchor's Eyes.

453
00:40:54.168 --> 00:40:56.668
(Hwanil Steel)

454
00:40:56.868 --> 00:40:59.969
Goodness. Kevin Lee is doomed.

455
00:41:02.339 --> 00:41:06.049
(Hwanil Steel)

456
00:41:13.049 --> 00:41:15.219
(Manager Baek Dong Hyun)

457
00:41:18.259 --> 00:41:19.429
It's from your manager.

458
00:41:20.058 --> 00:41:21.228
Shouldn't you answer him?

459
00:41:28.069 --> 00:41:29.969
- Hello? - Where are you?

460
00:41:29.969 --> 00:41:32.708
It's going viral on the Internet.

461
00:41:35.379 --> 00:41:38.078
(Real time hot search keywords)

462
00:41:43.219 --> 00:41:44.248
"My goodness."

463
00:41:44.248 --> 00:41:45.589
"Kevin got a million dollars for a 18-second-long commercial..."

464
00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:47.288
"while Kaham didn't get paid his 18,000 dollars."

465
00:41:47.518 --> 00:41:49.558
"Is it Hwanil Steel or Kevin Lee who's crazy?"

466
00:41:49.958 --> 00:41:52.029
"Is Kevin a golf player or an image laundry?"

467
00:41:52.228 --> 00:41:53.228
"Do you love money that much?"

468
00:41:53.888 --> 00:41:55.098
It's got 25,000 likes.

469
00:41:55.759 --> 00:41:58.768
Kevin and Hwanil Steel are getting criticized so much.

470
00:41:58.768 --> 00:42:01.538
Kevin might fall straight to the bottom at this rate.

471
00:42:02.168 --> 00:42:03.168
Attorney Kang?

472
00:42:04.038 --> 00:42:05.069
Attorney Kang.

473
00:42:05.368 --> 00:42:06.969
Make up with your wife.

474
00:42:06.969 --> 00:42:09.708
Your wife is trying hard to support you.

475
00:42:10.509 --> 00:42:12.179
- Good job. - Good job.

476
00:42:12.179 --> 00:42:14.179
- Good job. - Good job today.

477
00:42:14.179 --> 00:42:15.248
Thank you.

478
00:42:20.049 --> 00:42:21.418
It's topped the real time search keyword rank.

479
00:42:21.418 --> 00:42:23.888
People have left thousands of comments as soon as it got aired.

480
00:42:24.489 --> 00:42:26.659
Do you still want me to resign?

481
00:42:27.629 --> 00:42:28.899
You must be determined.

482
00:42:29.529 --> 00:42:30.728
Did you do it on purpose,

483
00:42:30.728 --> 00:42:32.699
knowing that the following commercial was that of Hwanil Steel?

484
00:42:32.768 --> 00:42:35.368
Have you seen any anchor who checks what commercial comes next?

485
00:42:35.469 --> 00:42:36.498
I haven't.

486
00:42:37.138 --> 00:42:40.868
Hwanil Steel wants to cut every single contract with us.

487
00:42:40.868 --> 00:42:42.879
From the CEO's office to the programs department,

488
00:42:42.879 --> 00:42:44.549
they've complained to everywhere. It's rampant in the station now.

489
00:42:44.978 --> 00:42:46.808
So they'll abuse their power with money?

490
00:42:47.748 --> 00:42:49.879
Stop being snobbish and go to the chief's office.

491
00:42:49.879 --> 00:42:50.978
He wants to see you.

492
00:42:51.248 --> 00:42:54.248
He's so furious that he might explode at any time.

493
00:42:54.248 --> 00:42:56.159
Go see him already.

494
00:43:29.877 --> 00:43:32.014
How could you stab me in the back like this again?

495
00:43:32.014 --> 00:43:35.045
They're our major advertiser, but we can't ignore the fact.

496
00:43:35.315 --> 00:43:38.016
We can't go easy on their misbehaviors.

497
00:43:38.746 --> 00:43:39.746
Goodness.

498
00:43:40.886 --> 00:43:43.456
What now? You want to become the spokesperson of the Blue House?

499
00:43:50.456 --> 00:43:51.726
How did you know?

500
00:43:51.866 --> 00:43:54.636
I met with the people from the Blue House just now.

501
00:43:55.396 --> 00:43:57.465
They came here to prepare for their investigation on you.

502
00:44:00.866 --> 00:44:01.976
What did you say to them?

503
00:44:01.976 --> 00:44:04.436
What do you mean? I told them only the facts...

504
00:44:04.846 --> 00:44:09.116
that she's stubborn, audacious, and rude.

505
00:44:09.476 --> 00:44:12.085
That she's too perfect, snobbish, and annoying.

506
00:44:13.146 --> 00:44:15.855
But it's more upsetting because this stuck-up is...

507
00:44:16.886 --> 00:44:19.956
the best in standing in the justice with her belief.

508
00:44:20.556 --> 00:44:22.655
I told them that makes me more upset. Are you satisfied?

509
00:44:26.166 --> 00:44:28.335
- Thank you. - Thank you, my foot.

510
00:44:29.795 --> 00:44:30.795
Look.

511
00:44:32.436 --> 00:44:34.266
It's not your path.

512
00:44:34.576 --> 00:44:38.275
Don't suffer by walking on a path that doesn't suit you.

513
00:44:39.146 --> 00:44:42.116
Just be the main anchor of News Nine for 2 or 3 more years.

514
00:44:42.416 --> 00:44:44.616
And this position will naturally be yours.

515
00:44:45.146 --> 00:44:46.146
Well?

516
00:44:48.056 --> 00:44:49.315
Don't get ahead of yourself.

517
00:44:50.355 --> 00:44:51.355
It's not decided...

518
00:44:52.355 --> 00:44:54.826
that I'll be the spokesperson. It's only my wish.

519
00:44:55.855 --> 00:44:58.065
Even if I'm selected to be the one,

520
00:44:59.065 --> 00:45:00.295
I won't forget...

521
00:45:01.965 --> 00:45:03.335
my gratitude towards you.

522
00:45:04.436 --> 00:45:06.905
I may be rude,

523
00:45:08.375 --> 00:45:09.775
but I'm loyal.

524
00:45:12.646 --> 00:45:14.516
Will you really go?

525
00:45:16.016 --> 00:45:17.045
If I don't,

526
00:45:19.746 --> 00:45:22.016
I'll regret it for the rest of my life.

527
00:45:32.166 --> 00:45:33.295
Goodness, this brat.

528
00:45:36.536 --> 00:45:38.565
You'll be reprimanded regarding the Hwanil Steel report.

529
00:45:39.636 --> 00:45:40.636
Brace yourself for that.

530
00:45:47.246 --> 00:45:48.246
Hye Ran.

531
00:45:49.616 --> 00:45:50.646
Here.

532
00:45:52.246 --> 00:45:53.246
Thank you.

533
00:46:06.326 --> 00:46:08.136
It's scary to be famous.

534
00:46:08.896 --> 00:46:11.905
You're being criticized more than Hwanil Steel. You know that?

535
00:46:13.105 --> 00:46:15.076
Shouldn't you take some kind of action?

536
00:46:18.706 --> 00:46:20.306
(Go Hye Ran)

537
00:46:23.045 --> 00:46:25.985
(Lee Jae Young)

538
00:46:38.096 --> 00:46:40.396
The number you have dialed is not available at this moment.

539
00:46:41.936 --> 00:46:44.065
(Manager Baek Dong Hyun)

540
00:46:47.405 --> 00:46:49.206
It's me. Where are you now?

541
00:46:50.476 --> 00:46:51.476
Yes.

542
00:47:02.186 --> 00:47:03.456
Yes, Han Ji Won speaking.

543
00:47:07.286 --> 00:47:08.355
Who's this?

544
00:47:11.166 --> 00:47:14.366
I'm Seo Eun Joo, Kevin Lee's wife.

545
00:47:46.465 --> 00:47:47.465
What are you doing here?

546
00:47:49.695 --> 00:47:51.366
Oh, hey. Nothing.

547
00:47:52.505 --> 00:47:55.335
I booked Kevin Lee for tomorrow afternoon. It's at 3pm.

548
00:47:56.605 --> 00:47:57.605
All right.

549
00:47:57.905 --> 00:47:59.306
Will you be all right?

550
00:47:59.505 --> 00:48:02.175
Everyone is posting mean comments about him too at the moment.

551
00:48:02.476 --> 00:48:04.346
"The Human" is about him though.

552
00:48:04.945 --> 00:48:06.116
If you're uncomfortable with it...

553
00:48:06.116 --> 00:48:08.516
It's not like the news was about verbally bashing him.

554
00:48:08.755 --> 00:48:11.686
He didn't even do research on the company he's modeling for.

555
00:48:12.386 --> 00:48:14.896
It's his fault for selling his public image like that.

556
00:48:15.855 --> 00:48:16.855
Aren't I right?

557
00:48:19.496 --> 00:48:22.436
I heard it'll start snowing later. Drive carefully.

558
00:48:23.436 --> 00:48:24.465
All right.

559
00:48:25.266 --> 00:48:26.636
Thanks for everything, Ki Seok.

560
00:48:28.735 --> 00:48:29.735
Oh, Hye Ran.

561
00:48:31.505 --> 00:48:33.675
You did such a great job today.

562
00:49:17.886 --> 00:49:19.255
What was that news about?

563
00:49:22.226 --> 00:49:23.396
What do you mean?

564
00:49:23.396 --> 00:49:25.965
That's my case. Why did you cover it on the news?

565
00:49:27.795 --> 00:49:29.195
I made the choice to cover it because...

566
00:49:29.195 --> 00:49:31.206
it's a valuable piece of information that people need to know.

567
00:49:31.206 --> 00:49:32.505
Not because you needed to do it?

568
00:49:33.965 --> 00:49:35.076
Are you questioning...

569
00:49:37.076 --> 00:49:40.175
the integrity and unbiasedness of my news show?

570
00:49:40.175 --> 00:49:41.516
It's my case and my job.

571
00:49:42.875 --> 00:49:46.186
I'm trying to make you understand how much you upset me.

572
00:49:50.116 --> 00:49:51.625
Look, Prosecutor Kang.

573
00:49:51.625 --> 00:49:55.056
I mean, Attorney Kang Tae Wook.

574
00:49:56.025 --> 00:49:57.226
That case of yours.

575
00:49:57.655 --> 00:49:58.996
Had I not covered it,

576
00:49:58.996 --> 00:50:01.936
it would've been buried a long time ago.

577
00:50:02.735 --> 00:50:04.936
Then you'd just drag it out and make Kaham get deported,

578
00:50:04.936 --> 00:50:06.735
which means you'll lose another case.

579
00:50:07.735 --> 00:50:08.735
I'll lose?

580
00:50:09.706 --> 00:50:10.706
Was that the reason?

581
00:50:11.875 --> 00:50:14.775
- What? - If I lose another case,

582
00:50:16.215 --> 00:50:19.715
you may not get the spokesperson position. Is that why you did it?

583
00:50:26.226 --> 00:50:27.226
Tae Wook.

584
00:50:29.226 --> 00:50:32.666
Your clients' desperate need to win must be tormenting you.

585
00:50:33.896 --> 00:50:36.396
They've had to endure unfair treatment and contempt.

586
00:50:36.936 --> 00:50:38.405
Seeing all of that must be heartbreaking.

587
00:50:39.036 --> 00:50:40.036
Then let me ask you this.

588
00:50:41.505 --> 00:50:44.505
Have you ever looked at me the way you look at them?

589
00:50:45.706 --> 00:50:47.976
I've also had to make desperate efforts to survive and get here.

590
00:50:48.576 --> 00:50:51.286
Have you tried putting a quarter of the efforts you make for others...

591
00:50:52.246 --> 00:50:53.916
into understanding me?

592
00:50:54.016 --> 00:50:55.016
Then what about you?

593
00:50:56.556 --> 00:50:58.855
Do you know what's getting me through this?

594
00:51:00.025 --> 00:51:02.195
Do you know how hard I'm trying to understand you?

595
00:51:02.195 --> 00:51:03.596
Are you even looking at me?

596
00:51:11.936 --> 00:51:13.065
You should've at least...

597
00:51:14.366 --> 00:51:17.576
discussed it with me before the show aired.

598
00:51:19.005 --> 00:51:20.175
You really should have.

599
00:51:30.315 --> 00:51:33.085
(Lee Jae Young)

600
00:51:39.596 --> 00:51:40.596
I'm sorry.

601
00:51:42.166 --> 00:51:43.536
I still have a meeting to attend.

602
00:51:44.706 --> 00:51:45.766
I have to go now.

603
00:51:55.675 --> 00:51:56.675
What's up?

604
00:51:57.246 --> 00:52:00.315
Shouldn't we meet up?

605
00:52:00.786 --> 00:52:01.786
Why should I meet you?

606
00:52:02.315 --> 00:52:04.655
I guess you haven't received the gift I sent you.

607
00:54:01.636 --> 00:54:03.076
Who's here at this late hour?

608
00:54:03.076 --> 00:54:06.206
Well, they're saying they're from the Blue House.

609
00:54:06.206 --> 00:54:07.405
The Blue House?

610
00:54:07.675 --> 00:54:09.815
They said they need to interview Ms. Go Hye Ran's family...

611
00:54:09.875 --> 00:54:12.886
as part of their pre-screening process.

612
00:54:32.766 --> 00:54:34.005
Please come in.

613
00:54:41.815 --> 00:54:43.116
So what's she doing now?

614
00:54:45.045 --> 00:54:47.286
She's in the driver's seat. She has not budged in the last 10 minutes.

615
00:54:48.456 --> 00:54:49.556
What should I do, Jae Young?

616
00:54:49.616 --> 00:54:52.286
Just keep an eye on her. I'm almost there.

617
00:55:11.405 --> 00:55:14.405
It's okay. Just leave.

618
00:55:16.976 --> 00:55:18.545
You have a dream.

619
00:55:19.686 --> 00:55:23.585
Just focus and pursue that dream of yours. Don't look back.

620
00:55:26.786 --> 00:55:27.786
Go on.

621
00:55:29.496 --> 00:55:30.996
Leave now, Hye Ran.

622
00:55:47.005 --> 00:55:48.346
Don't look back.

623
00:55:51.585 --> 00:55:52.886
Don't stop.

624
00:56:31.456 --> 00:56:33.226
(Lee Jae Young)

625
00:56:39.996 --> 00:56:41.025
Where are you?

626
00:56:43.636 --> 00:56:44.766
Where shall we meet?

627
00:56:45.605 --> 00:56:47.036
That's what you should ask.

628
00:56:48.005 --> 00:56:49.005
Hye Ran.

629
00:56:49.806 --> 00:56:50.806
Tell me.

630
00:56:51.806 --> 00:56:52.806
Where are you?

631
00:57:20.505 --> 00:57:23.136
Sir, move the car.

632
00:57:23.275 --> 00:57:24.605
Move the car now.

633
00:57:25.105 --> 00:57:27.146
Or move forward.

634
00:58:21.465 --> 00:58:22.496
Gosh.

635
00:58:22.735 --> 00:58:23.735
Where did she go?

636
00:59:56.025 --> 00:59:57.096
Hello.

637
00:59:58.565 --> 00:59:59.996
What brings you here at this hour?

638
01:00:08.605 --> 01:00:09.605
Sit down.

639
01:00:16.116 --> 01:00:17.246
Sit down.

640
01:02:04.826 --> 01:02:06.826
You'll only get hurt because of me.

641
01:02:06.925 --> 01:02:07.956
I know.

642
01:02:08.355 --> 01:02:10.295
I'm confident that I can handle it.

643
01:03:39.286 --> 01:03:42.085
(Eun Joo)

644
01:03:42.815 --> 01:03:43.815
Hye Ran.

645
01:03:46.456 --> 01:03:47.896
Please pick up the phone.

646
01:03:51.295 --> 01:03:52.525
Please pick up.

647
01:03:58.565 --> 01:03:59.706
Hye Ran.

648
01:04:02.706 --> 01:04:04.005
(Eun Joo)

649
01:04:31.206 --> 01:04:32.565
May I leave now?

650
01:04:44.616 --> 01:04:46.585
If she wishes to remain silent,

651
01:04:47.916 --> 01:04:48.916
I have no choice.

652
01:05:06.405 --> 01:05:07.405
By the way,

653
01:05:09.605 --> 01:05:12.175
why did you change the morning news on the day of the accident?

654
01:05:15.646 --> 01:05:18.545
You aren't the anchor other than News Nine.

655
01:05:19.315 --> 01:05:22.485
Why did you start to be on the morning news?

656
01:05:27.386 --> 01:05:30.596
Lee Yeon Jung had a stomach pain and went to the emergency room.

657
01:05:30.695 --> 01:05:32.596
I couldn't get a hold of anyone except you.

658
01:05:32.625 --> 01:05:34.636
It's okay.

659
01:05:34.636 --> 01:05:35.695
Thanks.

660
01:05:45.476 --> 01:05:47.306
Good work.

661
01:05:48.175 --> 01:05:50.315
Here's urgent news.

662
01:05:51.246 --> 01:05:52.445
We have one minute.

663
01:06:08.496 --> 01:06:11.065
Signal standby. Signal. Start.

664
01:06:15.306 --> 01:06:16.505
Hey, Hye Ran.

665
01:06:17.476 --> 01:06:18.576
Hye Ran?

666
01:06:27.916 --> 01:06:30.686
What's she doing? Go Hye Ran. Ma'am.

667
01:06:33.226 --> 01:06:34.226
Hye Ran.

668
01:06:43.335 --> 01:06:45.206
Hello, dear viewers.

669
01:06:45.536 --> 01:06:48.776
I'm Go Hye Ran on JBC Morning News.

670
01:06:52.106 --> 01:06:54.675
We received a breaking news overnight.

671
01:07:00.186 --> 01:07:02.455
My goodness. Go Hye Ran.

672
01:07:05.125 --> 01:07:06.285
Early this morning,

673
01:07:07.325 --> 01:07:09.556
Pro golfer Kevin Lee...

674
01:07:10.696 --> 01:07:13.696
was killed in a car accident.

675
01:07:13.865 --> 01:07:17.266
Here comes the footage. Sever 1 standby. Server 1 start.

676
01:07:19.406 --> 01:07:20.865
According to police,

677
01:07:20.865 --> 01:07:23.976
there was a crash in the intersection...

678
01:07:24.136 --> 01:07:25.675
on Gangbyeon Expressway towards Guri.

679
01:07:28.075 --> 01:07:30.175
Pro golfer Kevin Lee was found dead...

680
01:07:31.446 --> 01:07:34.886
at the site due to the crash.

681
01:07:37.615 --> 01:07:39.125
Possibility of drinking and driving...

682
01:07:40.386 --> 01:07:42.495
is still under investigation.

683
01:07:43.125 --> 01:07:45.665
(Pro golfer Kevin Lee killed in a car accident)

684
01:07:58.146 --> 01:07:59.875
Are you not going to answer again?

685
01:08:07.415 --> 01:08:09.615
You will find out through investigation.

686
01:08:10.085 --> 01:08:11.755
So I should move if I want to know?

687
01:08:14.526 --> 01:08:16.656
You make a point.

688
01:08:17.755 --> 01:08:18.766
Let's go.

689
01:08:51.665 --> 01:08:53.865
Not that way. Let's go this way.

690
01:08:54.325 --> 01:08:55.736
My car's parked in front.

691
01:08:56.136 --> 01:08:57.295
The press is here.

692
01:08:58.106 --> 01:08:59.136
What for?

693
01:09:00.236 --> 01:09:02.436
Why would they want to cover me? I'm only a testifier.

694
01:09:04.545 --> 01:09:06.545
They called you as a testifier,

695
01:09:07.606 --> 01:09:09.575
but they were actually investigating your alibi.

696
01:09:11.516 --> 01:09:12.516
I don't understand.

697
01:09:14.186 --> 01:09:15.316
Why would they want my alibi?

698
01:09:16.915 --> 01:09:18.656
What does all this mean?

699
01:09:22.196 --> 01:09:24.026
There was an article 30 minutes ago.

700
01:09:24.696 --> 01:09:27.096
It said Kevin Lee's death is more of a murder...

701
01:09:27.096 --> 01:09:28.936
than a car accident.

702
01:09:29.465 --> 01:09:31.636
An anonymous police source confirmed it.

703
01:09:34.306 --> 01:09:38.346
They'll get the accurate result through autopsy.

704
01:09:38.745 --> 01:09:40.245
It starts tomorrow morning.

705
01:09:40.245 --> 01:09:42.016
They're going to conduct an autopsy?

706
01:09:43.946 --> 01:09:45.285
Did Eun Joo agree to it?

707
01:09:46.245 --> 01:09:47.245
Yes.

708
01:10:04.196 --> 01:10:06.365
(Reporter Yoon Song Yi, 18 Missed Calls)

709
01:10:13.606 --> 01:10:14.615
It's me.

710
01:10:26.226 --> 01:10:27.226
What's going on?

711
01:10:27.386 --> 01:10:29.226
Why did it take so long to reach you?

712
01:10:29.596 --> 01:10:32.625
I'm at the police station. I was here as a testifier...

713
01:10:33.066 --> 01:10:36.566
Hye Ran. The situation isn't good.

714
01:10:37.865 --> 01:10:40.165
Since the article on Kevin Lee's murder was released,

715
01:10:40.436 --> 01:10:42.005
it's crazy everywhere.

716
01:10:43.806 --> 01:10:44.976
According to our information,

717
01:10:45.806 --> 01:10:48.146
the police thinks you're the suspect.

718
01:10:51.446 --> 01:10:52.446
Me?

719
01:10:54.285 --> 01:10:55.285
Why?

720
01:10:55.816 --> 01:10:57.285
I don't know that far yet.

721
01:10:57.556 --> 01:11:01.026
Anyway, I'll dig up some more and call you.

722
01:11:01.455 --> 01:11:04.125
Get out of there as soon as you can.

723
01:11:27.856 --> 01:11:28.856
I...

724
01:11:32.955 --> 01:11:34.186
I didn't do it, Honey.

725
01:11:46.035 --> 01:11:47.106
I didn't do it.

726
01:12:18.606 --> 01:12:21.175
(Misty)

727
01:12:21.505 --> 01:12:22.936
I didn't kill anyone.

728
01:12:22.936 --> 01:12:25.846
It means I have no reason to avoid anything.

729
01:12:25.846 --> 01:12:27.406
It doesn't matter even if you killed him.

730
01:12:27.476 --> 01:12:28.715
I didn't kill him.

731
01:12:28.715 --> 01:12:30.545
What do you think the news is?

732
01:12:30.545 --> 01:12:33.186
It's a show based on facts.

733
01:12:33.186 --> 01:12:35.955
What should I do, Hye Ran? What should I do?

734
01:12:35.955 --> 01:12:39.255
You heard nothing and saw nothing. Get it?

735
01:12:39.526 --> 01:12:41.425
Why did she lie?

736
01:12:41.755 --> 01:12:44.125
Was it fun to fool around with my husband?

737
01:12:44.325 --> 01:12:46.596
What did you do to the black box memory card?

738
01:12:46.696 --> 01:12:49.795
You should rely on me now, Hye Ran.

739
01:12:50.096 --> 01:12:51.806
It doesn't matter what the truth is.

740
01:12:51.806 --> 01:12:53.005
It's going to be a mess.

741
01:12:53.005 --> 01:12:55.205
Are you confident about this?
