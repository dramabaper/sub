<i>[Episode 5]</i>

4
00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.043
Are you asleep, Mom?

5
00:00:30.652 --> 00:00:32.508
I'm not asleep.

6
00:00:33.155 --> 00:00:36.097
But I don't want to move.

7
00:00:36.097 --> 00:00:38.408
I feel the same way.

8
00:00:41.011 --> 00:00:43.271
It'll probably be cold outside.

9
00:00:43.271 --> 00:00:44.745
Right?

10
00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.430
It's warm here.

11
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.364
Right?

12
00:00:49.834 --> 00:00:51.662
Yeah.

13
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.304
You know that story of the boy and girl

14
00:00:54.304 --> 00:00:57.990
who were wandering around in a forest

15
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:03.094
and discovered a house made of snacks?

16
00:01:03.094 --> 00:01:05.191
This reminds me of that.

17
00:01:05.191 --> 00:01:07.165
You mean Hansel and Gretel?

18
00:01:07.165 --> 00:01:09.555
You know how I almost screamed

19
00:01:09.555 --> 00:01:12.177
when they found that house
made of snacks?

20
00:01:12.177 --> 00:01:14.206
Because I was so happy?

21
00:01:15.986 --> 00:01:18.283
Are you saying that
we're like Hansel and Gretel?

22
00:01:18.283 --> 00:01:21.030
We had the book with that
story in it, at school

23
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.578
but the page where they found
the house made of snacks

24
00:01:24.578 --> 00:01:27.007
was all worn out, since it was
the most frequently read.

25
00:01:27.564 --> 00:01:31.263
Do you know what happens after that?

26
00:01:31.896 --> 00:01:33.924
They almost die.

27
00:01:33.924 --> 00:01:36.004
Because that house
belongs to a witch.

28
00:01:36.004 --> 00:01:37.974
Really?

29
00:01:37.974 --> 00:01:40.337
I didn't get to that part yet.

30
00:01:40.337 --> 00:01:43.370
It's a house that a witch made
out of snacks

31
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.932
so that she could lure
young children in.

32
00:01:46.493 --> 00:01:47.876
Oh no.

33
00:01:47.876 --> 00:01:49.588
But they don't die.

34
00:01:49.588 --> 00:01:52.247
The kids kill the witch,
and run away.

35
00:01:52.247 --> 00:01:53.592
What about the house?

36
00:01:53.592 --> 00:01:55.592
Do they eat it all?

37
00:01:56.424 --> 00:01:57.867
Are you hungry?

38
00:01:58.576 --> 00:02:00.025
Yes.

39
00:02:00.664 --> 00:02:03.050
We have to get you
something to eat.

40
00:02:05.236 --> 00:02:07.319
You need to eat so that
you can take your medicine.

41
00:02:17.435 --> 00:02:20.296
This footage is from
December 16th at 10:45 p.m.

42
00:02:20.296 --> 00:02:22.436
on the second floor
of Baek Island Mart.

43
00:02:23.018 --> 00:02:24.683
What, you can't see it again?

44
00:02:24.683 --> 00:02:27.734
We zoomed in as much as possible so you
could see her eyes, nose, and mouth.

45
00:02:30.926 --> 00:02:32.580
On that day...

46
00:02:33.657 --> 00:02:36.634
I was a bit annoyed even before
I'd gone to the supermarket.

47
00:02:36.634 --> 00:02:39.597
I hurried out since I thought
that it'd be closing soon.

48
00:02:39.597 --> 00:02:42.284
But Hye Na said that
she wanted to go to the bathroom

49
00:02:42.284 --> 00:02:43.674
as soon as we got in the car.

50
00:02:43.674 --> 00:02:46.830
I barely managed to check out
at the supermarket, and was leaving

51
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.675
but she said she wanted
to use the bathroom again

52
00:02:48.675 --> 00:02:49.895
as soon as the elevator came!

53
00:02:49.895 --> 00:02:51.435
So you hit her with the cart?

54
00:02:51.435 --> 00:02:53.225
It looks a lot worse in the footage.

55
00:02:53.225 --> 00:02:55.588
She only got a few scrapes
and bruises, is all!

56
00:03:05.656 --> 00:03:09.169
On December 12th, you pushed your child
in front of your home, didn't you?

57
00:03:10.588 --> 00:03:12.175
This day was probably the day...

58
00:03:13.277 --> 00:03:16.784
that Hye Na asked me to
buy a new cage for Jjing.

59
00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:20.268
My hands were shaking because I was
worried about my credit card bill

60
00:03:20.268 --> 00:03:21.817
at the end of the month.

61
00:03:21.817 --> 00:03:24.522
But she kept complaining about how
the door of Jjing's cage opened

62
00:03:24.522 --> 00:03:26.740
and said, "What if Jjing runs away?"

63
00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:39.489
Um, if you have some time
by any chance, ma'am...

64
00:03:40.871 --> 00:03:43.032
take care of these for me.

65
00:03:43.032 --> 00:03:47.241
I have to hurry and go to a
funeral by tomorrow morning.

66
00:03:48.135 --> 00:03:49.998
They can't get cold.

67
00:03:49.998 --> 00:03:52.578
And be sure to give them
fresh water in the morning.

68
00:03:53.457 --> 00:03:54.580
Sure.

69
00:03:56.653 --> 00:03:59.242
This is rice, and some side dishes.

70
00:03:59.242 --> 00:04:01.456
And if you open up
the cabinet under the sink

71
00:04:01.456 --> 00:04:02.875
you'll find pots and a rice cooker.

72
00:04:03.375 --> 00:04:05.723
I'm busy, so I'll get going.
Get some rest.

73
00:04:05.723 --> 00:04:08.564
Um, thank you for the food!

74
00:04:36.517 --> 00:04:38.086
I...

75
00:04:40.576 --> 00:04:42.959
hit Hye Na a lot.

76
00:04:44.735 --> 00:04:47.125
I hit her with my hands...

77
00:04:47.807 --> 00:04:50.233
and with whatever else
I could get my hands on.

78
00:04:58.136 --> 00:05:00.634
<i>But Seol Ak never did that.</i>

79
00:05:00.634 --> 00:05:03.151
<i>He protected Hye Na...</i>

80
00:05:03.151 --> 00:05:05.153
<i>and protected me.</i>

81
00:05:05.153 --> 00:05:08.278
There was nobody who had
done that for me before.

82
00:05:09.783 --> 00:05:11.863
The only one who had
done that for me was Seol Ak.

83
00:05:20.795 --> 00:05:22.855
Hello, sir.

84
00:05:22.855 --> 00:05:24.956
That'll be 1,400 won.

85
00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:35.841
Meet me "there" after work.

86
00:05:36.523 --> 00:05:38.725
Have a pleasant day.

87
00:06:16.807 --> 00:06:18.807
Is it okay for you to be drinking coffee?

88
00:06:21.028 --> 00:06:24.204
Seeing your face is making
me a bit nervous, Honey.

89
00:06:24.204 --> 00:06:26.295
So I have to drink coffee
to calm my nerves.

90
00:06:32.187 --> 00:06:34.187
I...

91
00:06:34.802 --> 00:06:36.576
want to get married.

92
00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.771
That person doesn't
know about anything.

93
00:06:42.329 --> 00:06:44.230
About Won Hee, I mean.

94
00:06:47.596 --> 00:06:50.396
I really want this to work out for me.

95
00:06:50.396 --> 00:06:52.543
If you're going to get married...

96
00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:55.908
you must have saved up some money.

97
00:06:58.391 --> 00:07:00.233
How much do you need?

98
00:07:01.298 --> 00:07:03.028
You tell me.

99
00:07:04.404 --> 00:07:06.336
Is three million won enough?

100
00:07:13.875 --> 00:07:15.872
It's because I have
to spend a lot...

101
00:07:16.535 --> 00:07:18.783
on the dress and other things.

102
00:07:19.791 --> 00:07:21.456
- Five million?
- Hey.

103
00:07:22.237 --> 00:07:24.201
You're getting married...

104
00:07:25.024 --> 00:07:27.158
and yet, I can't do
anything for you.

105
00:07:28.166 --> 00:07:30.713
But what I can do is take that
money and go away forever.

106
00:07:31.437 --> 00:07:33.485
Also, let me borrow your car.

107
00:07:36.658 --> 00:07:39.458
If I just lend you five million
and my car...

108
00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:43.589
will things really be
over for good between us?

109
00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:44.884
No.

110
00:07:49.927 --> 00:07:52.026
You have to...

111
00:07:52.581 --> 00:07:54.706
guess the correct
answer to this question

112
00:07:54.706 --> 00:07:56.370
for this to all be over.

113
00:07:58.307 --> 00:08:00.418
Why did Won Hee die?

114
00:08:03.661 --> 00:08:05.742
Your son, Won Hee.

115
00:08:06.398 --> 00:08:07.843
Why did he die?

116
00:08:12.821 --> 00:08:14.592
Won Hee...

117
00:08:17.005 --> 00:08:19.756
was playing on the balcony...

118
00:08:21.126 --> 00:08:23.509
while I went out to work...

119
00:08:26.662 --> 00:08:29.211
and climbed up on top of
the clay fermentation jars...

120
00:08:33.054 --> 00:08:35.363
and fell.

121
00:08:35.363 --> 00:08:38.613
That's what you may
be telling others...

122
00:08:39.394 --> 00:08:41.538
but you have to state
the real reason to me.

123
00:08:41.538 --> 00:08:46.062
That it was because
you wanted Won Hee to disappear.

124
00:08:46.062 --> 00:08:47.538
That's not true.

125
00:08:48.567 --> 00:08:51.910
- You did it!
- Because I knew how you felt.

126
00:08:53.557 --> 00:08:55.510
If you still had Won Hee

127
00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:58.222
do you think you'd be
able to get married?

128
00:09:00.408 --> 00:09:02.260
You know?

129
00:09:32.642 --> 00:09:36.876
<i>That was because
you wanted Won Hee to disappear.</i>

130
00:09:36.876 --> 00:09:38.073
<i>That's not true.</i>

131
00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:40.700
<i>You did it!</i>

132
00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:42.658
<i>Because I knew how you felt.</i>

133
00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:08.587
You got back early.

134
00:10:09.248 --> 00:10:10.433
Yes.

135
00:10:12.386 --> 00:10:13.899
Are you considering...

136
00:10:14.566 --> 00:10:17.998
putting your rooftop room up for rent?

137
00:10:17.998 --> 00:10:19.701
Yes.

138
00:10:20.755 --> 00:10:23.203
May we stay there
for just one month?

139
00:10:23.203 --> 00:10:24.437
Yes, you can.

140
00:10:24.437 --> 00:10:26.697
How much should I give you for rent?

141
00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:33.610
The rent for the barber shop
is 1.5 million won per month.

142
00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:36.989
So I'll need at least 200,000 won
from you per month.

143
00:10:37.642 --> 00:10:39.116
That's way too cheap.

144
00:10:39.116 --> 00:10:40.883
You don't have to stay here
if you don't want to.

145
00:10:40.883 --> 00:10:43.741
If I accept a lot of rent from you,
I'll have to do everything you ask.

146
00:10:43.741 --> 00:10:45.902
I don't like having to worry
about things like that.

147
00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:55.945
Here you are.

148
00:11:04.408 --> 00:11:05.725
Hello.

149
00:11:05.725 --> 00:11:08.121
Is the guest staying at Suite 816 here?

150
00:11:08.121 --> 00:11:09.620
Just a moment.

151
00:11:11.567 --> 00:11:13.639
She checked out.

152
00:11:14.326 --> 00:11:15.594
Oh... really?

153
00:11:17.739 --> 00:11:21.529
You're the first person who's
accompanying me as a guardian.

154
00:11:22.318 --> 00:11:26.158
I've never taken someone
to the doctor's office with me before.

155
00:11:26.158 --> 00:11:27.693
Why not?

156
00:11:27.693 --> 00:11:31.736
Mr. Jae Beom, Yi Jin, and everyone
else are so good to you, though.

157
00:11:32.823 --> 00:11:35.759
I've lived like a queen all these years.

158
00:11:35.759 --> 00:11:40.235
I've never lost my dignity
as an actress before.

159
00:11:40.235 --> 00:11:41.599
I know.

160
00:11:41.599 --> 00:11:43.448
You're amazing.

161
00:11:43.448 --> 00:11:45.620
Do you know what my secret to that is?

162
00:11:47.735 --> 00:11:51.624
It's because I'm always
putting on an act.

163
00:11:51.624 --> 00:11:54.599
The role I've been assigned
is that of a queen.

164
00:11:54.599 --> 00:11:55.759
An ice queen.

165
00:11:56.629 --> 00:11:59.572
So I never let myself
reveal my true emotions.

166
00:11:59.572 --> 00:12:03.275
And whenever I ask a favor of someone,
I do it in a demanding way.

167
00:12:03.275 --> 00:12:05.916
And no matter how nice
people are to me

168
00:12:05.916 --> 00:12:08.477
I act as if it's only natural
that they treat me that way.

169
00:12:08.477 --> 00:12:10.759
And if someone
wrongs me in any way

170
00:12:10.759 --> 00:12:13.399
I pay them back tenfold or more,
without remorse.

171
00:12:14.024 --> 00:12:15.884
I've never cried in front of others

172
00:12:15.884 --> 00:12:18.110
without a camera there
to shoot me, either.

173
00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:19.700
Except for one person.

174
00:12:20.222 --> 00:12:22.153
I've only ever cried in front of you.

175
00:12:31.289 --> 00:12:35.645
My husband ran off last year
with some younger woman.

176
00:12:35.645 --> 00:12:37.990
And left me with
nothing but debt.

177
00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:40.575
I know that there are many women

178
00:12:40.575 --> 00:12:44.003
who overcome that and live on
with a strong will, but...

179
00:12:44.688 --> 00:12:46.006
I wasn't one of them.

180
00:12:46.529 --> 00:12:49.870
I was so miserable that I could die,
and I caused a drunk driving accident.

181
00:12:50.494 --> 00:12:52.909
So all the projects that
I had lined up were canceled.

182
00:12:53.503 --> 00:12:56.254
I was considering
just dying, and then...

183
00:12:56.903 --> 00:13:00.034
my agency insisted that
I needed to clean up my image.

184
00:13:00.034 --> 00:13:03.774
So I went to the orphanage, planning
to volunteer there for just one week.

185
00:13:05.134 --> 00:13:07.788
You know that I truly had
a fabulous time there, right?

186
00:13:08.398 --> 00:13:10.331
It was all thanks to you.

187
00:13:19.773 --> 00:13:22.004
<i>And so, I thought...</i>

188
00:13:22.634 --> 00:13:27.047
<i>that I would have nothing to fear
if I had a child like you.</i>

189
00:13:27.047 --> 00:13:29.375
I guess I'm just that kind of person.

190
00:13:29.375 --> 00:13:31.785
I'm too scared to live by myself.

191
00:13:32.971 --> 00:13:34.774
If you really hate this so much

192
00:13:34.774 --> 00:13:37.629
just think of me as the CEO
of your entertainment company.

193
00:13:38.549 --> 00:13:40.565
I'll do my very best

194
00:13:40.565 --> 00:13:43.890
and make sure you're well-fed,
well-dressed, and well-educated.

195
00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:47.139
And I'll be on your side,
no matter what.

196
00:13:57.332 --> 00:14:00.631
I'll take you to your hospital
appointments from now on...

197
00:14:01.337 --> 00:14:03.335
until I leave Korea.

198
00:14:04.374 --> 00:14:05.966
Thanks.

199
00:14:05.966 --> 00:14:08.840
Also, let's take this opportunity
to revise our contract.

200
00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.817
I'll be the CEO of your
entertainment company

201
00:14:10.817 --> 00:14:13.042
and you'll be one of my talents.

202
00:14:13.042 --> 00:14:14.717
As for the terms of the contract

203
00:14:14.717 --> 00:14:16.573
we promise to respect one another

204
00:14:16.573 --> 00:14:18.206
and let each other live freely.

205
00:14:18.943 --> 00:14:22.192
If we do that, we may be able
to grow closer together.

206
00:14:24.469 --> 00:14:26.145
Okay, fine!

207
00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:30.166
But you know,
I think you've changed a bit.

208
00:14:30.998 --> 00:14:34.337
When I first put you
in the backseat of my car

209
00:14:34.337 --> 00:14:37.490
and felt as if I'd become
a mother for the first time...

210
00:14:38.716 --> 00:14:40.558
it feels kind of like back then.

211
00:14:42.191 --> 00:14:43.783
Really?

212
00:15:03.629 --> 00:15:06.793
<i>I want to be a barber
when I grow up, too.</i>

213
00:15:06.793 --> 00:15:08.352
<i>Why?</i>

214
00:15:08.352 --> 00:15:11.133
<i>The barber scissors are so pretty.</i>

215
00:15:11.133 --> 00:15:13.683
<i>And they make
such a pleasant sound.</i>

216
00:15:13.683 --> 00:15:16.374
<i>And you look so cool
when you're working.</i>

217
00:15:16.374 --> 00:15:19.702
<i>And the men are powerless
against you, too!</i>

218
00:15:19.702 --> 00:15:21.208
<i>Yoon Bok.</i>

219
00:15:21.208 --> 00:15:25.283
<i>There's no need for you
to become a barber later on.</i>

220
00:15:25.283 --> 00:15:26.816
<i>Why not?</i>

221
00:15:26.816 --> 00:15:29.113
<i>Because you can become one now.</i>

222
00:15:30.275 --> 00:15:32.572
<i>Every barber starts</i>

223
00:15:32.572 --> 00:15:35.549
<i>with sweeping up
the hair on the floor.</i>

224
00:15:38.063 --> 00:15:42.559
<i>And the most important thing is that
you wash other people's hair well.</i>

225
00:15:53.489 --> 00:15:56.363
Doesn't it seem like
there's too much lather in my hair?

226
00:16:03.749 --> 00:16:04.850
Ow!

227
00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:06.791
Ow, that hurts.

228
00:16:06.791 --> 00:16:08.359
Oh?

229
00:16:10.153 --> 00:16:12.035
It's okay, it's okay!

230
00:16:16.956 --> 00:16:19.715
This is the scan that we took last week.

231
00:16:19.715 --> 00:16:23.125
You can see how the
tumor has spread, right?

232
00:16:23.125 --> 00:16:26.587
Don't scare the poor girl.
She may cry.

233
00:16:26.587 --> 00:16:28.730
All doctors talk like this.

234
00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:31.350
And there are some who
even tell you not to get treatment

235
00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:35.558
saying that the people who will die
will die while suffering

236
00:16:35.558 --> 00:16:37.625
and those who will get better
will get better.

237
00:16:37.625 --> 00:16:39.566
And there are tons of different
treatment options nowadays, too.

238
00:16:39.566 --> 00:16:44.413
So, which treatment methods
have you tried so far?

239
00:16:45.319 --> 00:16:47.249
Well...

240
00:16:47.952 --> 00:16:51.262
I bought a pair of sneakers.

241
00:16:52.559 --> 00:16:54.932
And a pair of pants
that match them.

242
00:16:56.611 --> 00:16:59.115
And an overcoat that matches those.

243
00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:04.173
And I don't pick up phone calls
from people I don't like.

244
00:17:04.173 --> 00:17:06.964
And I eat whatever I want,
whenever I want.

245
00:17:07.609 --> 00:17:09.959
So, have you decided to
have chemotherapy?

246
00:17:09.959 --> 00:17:11.375
For now, yeah.

247
00:17:11.375 --> 00:17:15.174
What... made you change your mind?

248
00:17:15.791 --> 00:17:17.933
I'm not scared of dying.

249
00:17:17.933 --> 00:17:21.721
Because I can just do it in my
own style, like everything else I do.

250
00:17:22.695 --> 00:17:25.444
I don't think you'd understand,
Doctor, since you're a man.

251
00:17:25.444 --> 00:17:28.174
But the thing about
being a mother is that...

252
00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:32.000
Being a mother means that

253
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.906
you can't leave behind your children
to just go and die.

254
00:17:34.906 --> 00:17:38.008
I have three children, Doctor.

255
00:17:38.008 --> 00:17:40.984
Two of them grew up in a normal
environment, and are adults.

256
00:17:40.984 --> 00:17:42.837
But she's the only one
among my kids

257
00:17:42.837 --> 00:17:44.680
who stopped growing up
when she was eight

258
00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:47.039
and is the same as she was then.

259
00:17:48.372 --> 00:17:50.450
In my heart, I mean.

260
00:18:06.117 --> 00:18:07.829
Get some rest, Ma'am.

261
00:18:15.477 --> 00:18:17.144
Mom.

262
00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:21.703
You can stop acting now.

263
00:18:22.332 --> 00:18:25.634
Even queens are allowed
to be themselves, a little.

264
00:18:25.634 --> 00:18:28.171
And when it gets too much
for them, they're allowed to retire.

265
00:18:28.826 --> 00:18:31.817
And if you're in pain,
complain about it a bit.

266
00:18:32.457 --> 00:18:33.826
If it weren't for you...

267
00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:39.006
I'd rip all of this off
and leave this place.

268
00:18:39.632 --> 00:18:42.821
I'm good at handling emotional pain.

269
00:18:42.821 --> 00:18:45.465
But I'm really bad with physical pain.

270
00:18:48.228 --> 00:18:49.642
But you know, Mom...

271
00:18:50.592 --> 00:18:54.614
you're not exactly great at dealing
with emotional pain, either.

272
00:18:56.682 --> 00:18:57.942
Yeah.

273
00:19:02.508 --> 00:19:03.815
Mom.

274
00:19:06.375 --> 00:19:07.519
Mom!

275
00:19:09.848 --> 00:19:11.105
Mom!

276
00:19:14.347 --> 00:19:15.871
<i>[Samhwa Barber Shop]</i>

277
00:19:15.871 --> 00:19:18.880
<i>[I'll be right back. If you need me,
please call 010-822-7329]</i>

278
00:19:20.901 --> 00:19:23.443
What are their names?

279
00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:32.451
I named them so long ago, but it's been
so long since I've called them by name.

280
00:19:32.451 --> 00:19:34.324
So I've forgotten their names.

281
00:19:34.324 --> 00:19:36.583
Do these birds know that
they belong to you

282
00:19:36.583 --> 00:19:39.450
even if you don't call them
by their names?

283
00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:41.362
Every time my mom calls my name

284
00:19:41.362 --> 00:19:46.042
I think to myself that
I'm my mom's child.

285
00:19:47.174 --> 00:19:48.784
Really?

286
00:19:49.609 --> 00:19:51.314
Yoon Bok.

287
00:19:51.847 --> 00:19:53.683
That's quite a lovely name.

288
00:19:53.683 --> 00:19:55.178
I know, right?

289
00:19:57.593 --> 00:20:01.723
But, is it okay if I feed them?

290
00:20:01.723 --> 00:20:04.541
I like to feed animals.

291
00:20:05.712 --> 00:20:09.923
I'll entrust the bird-feeding task
to you from now on, then, Yoon Bok.

292
00:20:09.923 --> 00:20:11.336
All right!

293
00:20:11.885 --> 00:20:14.983
What is there in Iceland?

294
00:20:17.184 --> 00:20:20.695
Birds, the ocean, and the sky.

295
00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:24.484
Tons of academic papers
that need to be written.

296
00:20:25.087 --> 00:20:26.465
And...

297
00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:30.826
I have a secret that only I know about.

298
00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:33.717
A man?

299
00:20:34.951 --> 00:20:36.890
Ugh, how boring.

300
00:20:38.038 --> 00:20:41.461
Can't you leave later
if it's not about having a man?

301
00:20:41.461 --> 00:20:43.674
I might die soon, after all.

302
00:20:43.674 --> 00:20:45.507
I'll come back.

303
00:20:46.309 --> 00:20:48.346
I'll be back in six months,
at the very latest.

304
00:20:49.084 --> 00:20:50.613
Or in three months.

305
00:20:50.613 --> 00:20:51.703
Hah.

306
00:20:52.238 --> 00:20:54.892
I have to stay alive
for six whole months, then.

307
00:20:57.234 --> 00:20:58.815
Please.

308
00:21:05.588 --> 00:21:07.387
Doctor Jung?

309
00:21:09.689 --> 00:21:12.031
She's right next to me.

310
00:21:12.031 --> 00:21:13.736
Want me to put her on the line?

311
00:21:14.567 --> 00:21:17.590
Why did you call me if you weren't
going to ask me to put her on the line?

312
00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:20.707
I'm in so much pain right now
because of the chemo.

313
00:21:21.381 --> 00:21:22.790
Doctor Jung...

314
00:21:23.375 --> 00:21:25.438
What a strange fellow.

315
00:21:40.714 --> 00:21:42.630
What about this one?

316
00:21:43.255 --> 00:21:45.519
That's the key for that safe over there.

317
00:21:53.954 --> 00:21:55.444
What about this one?

318
00:21:55.444 --> 00:21:57.516
That's the key for the bird cage.

319
00:21:58.438 --> 00:22:00.978
I'll need to hold on to this one.

320
00:22:00.978 --> 00:22:02.915
Since I'm the one who feeds them.

321
00:22:03.442 --> 00:22:04.748
Sure.

322
00:22:07.127 --> 00:22:08.895
What about this one?

323
00:22:12.395 --> 00:22:13.769
That one is...

324
00:22:14.778 --> 00:22:16.519
I'm not sure about that one.

325
00:22:18.237 --> 00:22:20.130
Let's stop this now.

326
00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:22.558
It'll be bad if
I lose any of these. Okay?

<i>[Safe]</i>

328
00:22:35.661 --> 00:22:39.871
On December 16th,
at Baek Island Mart, did you push a cart

329
00:22:39.871 --> 00:22:41.329
at Kim Hye Na,

330

Yes.

331

Are you at all related to the

No.

No.

335

Is Lee Seol Ak, the man you live with,
related to Kim Hye Na's disappearance?

- That's not true.

345
00:23:47.731 --> 00:23:50.063
- Hey, watch it!
- Pardon me.

346
00:23:50.063 --> 00:23:51.571
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

347
00:23:52.522 --> 00:23:56.060
Hello! I'm Park Jae Beom,
the person who contacted you earlier.

348
00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:58.630
Oh, I see.

349
00:23:59.993 --> 00:24:01.513
I've heard a lot about you.

350
00:24:01.513 --> 00:24:02.618
I see.

351
00:24:02.618 --> 00:24:04.288
- What's this?
- Well, this is...

352
00:24:04.288 --> 00:24:07.290
I heard that you liked the
30-year-old ones, so I...

353
00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:08.939
Thanks.

354
00:24:09.531 --> 00:24:11.877
But I like single malts more.

355
00:24:15.371 --> 00:24:17.167
What brings you here?

<i>[Samhwa Barber Shop]</i>

357
00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:25.391
I'm sorry for being back so late.

358
00:24:25.391 --> 00:24:26.588
I came straight here.

359
00:24:27.243 --> 00:24:30.342
Yoon Bok didn't cough much today.

360
00:24:30.342 --> 00:24:32.631
She had a good appetite
and played a lot.

361
00:24:32.631 --> 00:24:34.423
She got washed up,
and she's sleeping now.

362
00:24:34.423 --> 00:24:35.759
Thank you.

363
00:24:35.759 --> 00:24:38.355
Thanks to you, I was able to
take my mother to the hospital.

364
00:24:38.355 --> 00:24:41.455
You shouldn't take young children
to hospitals, after all.

365
00:24:42.457 --> 00:24:44.810
Yes. Yoon Bok isn't
completely healthy right now, so...

366
00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:48.323
You shouldn't take healthy children
to hospitals, either.

367
00:24:48.323 --> 00:24:50.877
If you have to go there,
just leave her here and go.

368
00:24:51.772 --> 00:24:53.076
All right.

369
00:24:53.076 --> 00:24:55.136
I'm quite thankful, but...

370
00:24:55.136 --> 00:24:57.148
I don't think that's fair to you.

371
00:24:57.148 --> 00:24:58.586
Then...

372
00:24:59.109 --> 00:25:01.136
do you want to pay me?

373
00:25:02.186 --> 00:25:05.520
You can pay me money
to look after your child.

374
00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:06.945
Shall I do that, then?

375
00:25:06.945 --> 00:25:11.390
I feed her lunch and dinner
and do everything else, too, so...

376
00:25:12.042 --> 00:25:14.563
I'll need at least 5,000 won from you.

377
00:25:16.734 --> 00:25:20.002
Then, I'll give you 5,000 per hour.

378
00:25:21.154 --> 00:25:22.714
Yoon Bok's mother.

379
00:25:22.714 --> 00:25:24.951
Yoon Bok feeds herself
with her own hands

380
00:25:24.951 --> 00:25:26.590
and she can take care
of herself just fine

381
00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:27.693
so how could I accept that

382
00:25:27.693 --> 00:25:29.866
when it's not even that
hard to look after her?

383
00:25:29.866 --> 00:25:32.557
It'll be 5,000 won per day.

384
00:25:32.557 --> 00:25:35.892
Also, I'm looking after
your child because I like her.

385
00:25:35.892 --> 00:25:40.182
If anything, she's doing me a favor
by keeping this old crone company.

386
00:25:40.182 --> 00:25:42.858
I'm so used to eating alone every day.

387
00:25:42.858 --> 00:25:46.371
But now, I hear a cute voice
talking to me as I eat.

388
00:25:46.371 --> 00:25:48.857
And that gives me
more of an appetite.

389
00:25:49.357 --> 00:25:51.326
But still, that's not
nearly enough money.

390
00:25:51.817 --> 00:25:55.107
Is your mother severely ill?

391
00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:57.076
Yes.

392
00:25:57.586 --> 00:25:59.284
She has cancer.

393
00:25:59.284 --> 00:26:00.693
Goodness.

394
00:26:01.224 --> 00:26:04.873
I saw her on a TV show
not too long ago, though.

395
00:26:05.307 --> 00:26:08.704
You... know my mother?

396
00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:12.491
Everyone in this neighborhood knows her.

Um...

399
00:26:17.611 --> 00:26:20.678
I've been meaning to
ask you this, but...

400
00:26:23.171 --> 00:26:27.772
but, 20 years ago,
back when I was a high schooler...

401
00:26:28.378 --> 00:26:32.946
when there was a car accident

No.

407
00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:54.946
My mother visited you,
saying that she'd like to repay you.

408
00:26:54.946 --> 00:26:57.346
But she said that you insisted
that you weren't the one.

409
00:26:57.346 --> 00:26:59.666
I don't remember that.

410
00:27:04.695 --> 00:27:06.338
I'll need to get some sleep now.

411
00:27:06.338 --> 00:27:09.006
You should go upstairs and
get some rest too, Yoon Bok's mom.

412
00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:36.469
Mom.

413
00:27:37.621 --> 00:27:39.513
You were waiting for me, weren't you?

414
00:27:48.867 --> 00:27:50.741
What's the matter, Yoon Bok?

415
00:27:51.429 --> 00:27:54.190
I came home too late, didn't I?

416
00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:55.827
Did you wait for me
for a long time?

417
00:27:56.323 --> 00:27:57.727
It's because...

418
00:27:58.573 --> 00:28:00.817
I'm so happy.

419
00:28:02.486 --> 00:28:05.457
We don't have to go anywhere...

420
00:28:06.101 --> 00:28:09.387
and we don't have to run.

421
00:28:11.041 --> 00:28:13.875
Because we can just be here...

422
00:28:13.875 --> 00:28:15.801
like this.

423
00:28:21.223 --> 00:28:23.089
We'll...

424
00:28:23.089 --> 00:28:26.330
become even happier, day by day.

425
00:28:27.164 --> 00:28:30.484
Later on, it'll feel natural to be happy.

426
00:28:31.807 --> 00:28:36.048
Later on, you won't even remember...

427
00:28:36.752 --> 00:28:38.653
your old name or your old life.

428
00:28:40.387 --> 00:28:43.040
And when I tell you later on that
you cried because you were so happy

429
00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:45.568
you'll laugh, thinking
that it was ridiculous.

seems to be quite a kind person.

434

We're so lucky...

435
00:29:18.511 --> 00:29:21.336

I don't like this.

Why are you making these sorts of

Shouldn't you be focusing on

Yes.

It's a completely
normal thing to do.

My real estate will be distributed
equally after being appraised.

446
00:29:58.298 --> 00:30:00.584
As for my shares and gold,
they are to be sold at market price

I'm fine with anything, Mom.
If you leave me things, I'll be thankful.

But if you don't, that's fine, too.

452
00:30:11.256 --> 00:30:13.712
I'll do exactly as
you all decide today.

That's... okay with you, right?

Of course.

455
00:30:16.897 --> 00:30:18.430
Hurry and go, then.

456
00:30:19.631 --> 00:30:22.012
I'll see you this weekend,
Yi Jin and Soo Jin!

457
00:30:24.375 --> 00:30:27.643
I'm going to give
this house to Yi Jin.

458
00:30:27.643 --> 00:30:29.230
But, Yi Jin.

459
00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:31.503
You can't sell this house until I die.

460
00:30:32.175 --> 00:30:33.713
Why not, Mom?

461
00:30:33.713 --> 00:30:35.904
There needs to be a place
for our family to get together.

462
00:30:35.904 --> 00:30:38.531
It costs so much to
maintain this huge house!

463
00:30:38.531 --> 00:30:41.224
And I might need cash
in a hurry later on!

464
00:30:41.224 --> 00:30:42.326
In exchange...

465
00:30:42.326 --> 00:30:46.467
the furniture in this house, as well
as the decorations and my clothes

466
00:30:46.467 --> 00:30:48.272
will all be yours.

467
00:30:48.988 --> 00:30:53.030
Including your shoes, bags,
and jewelry, too?

468
00:30:53.030 --> 00:30:54.455
Yeah.

469
00:30:54.455 --> 00:30:57.887
Well, I'm the only one
who has your shoe size.

470
00:30:58.637 --> 00:31:00.333
I'm sorry...

471
00:31:00.333 --> 00:31:03.451
but I'd like to give up my right
to inherit anything.

472

I'm sorry, Soo Jin.

473
00:31:06.012 --> 00:31:08.751
But I won't be leaving you anything.

474
00:31:08.751 --> 00:31:10.743
I was thinking for quite a long time

475
00:31:10.743 --> 00:31:13.086
after the two of us spoke.

476
00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:16.483
I wanted to let you be
as free as possible

477
00:31:16.483 --> 00:31:18.769
so I rewrote my will.

478
00:31:18.769 --> 00:31:21.226
I won't give you
anything at all.

479
00:31:21.226 --> 00:31:25.006
You won't be held down by me anymore.

480
00:31:25.006 --> 00:31:27.645
And you have no obligations
toward me anymore, either.

481
00:31:28.227 --> 00:31:31.336
So go and fly free,
to wherever you wish.

482
00:31:34.253 --> 00:31:36.590
Thank you so much. Really.

483
00:31:39.023 --> 00:31:41.913
But here, it says...

484
00:31:42.486 --> 00:31:44.405
You'll see when you
read it until the end.

485
00:31:44.405 --> 00:31:46.851
Those things aren't
being passed down to you

486
00:31:46.851 --> 00:31:50.382
but to your future children,
Ms. Soo Jin.

487
00:31:50.382 --> 00:31:53.438
I don't want my children to
inherit anything, either.

488
00:31:53.438 --> 00:31:56.711
Just as you are my daughter, yet
I can't force you to do as I wish

489
00:31:56.711 --> 00:32:00.001
I don't think you'll be able to force
your child to do as you wish, either.

490
00:32:00.528 --> 00:32:04.580
I've made it so your child can decide
for themselves when they are of age.

491
00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:07.781
Because there is a possibility
that you may never have a child

492
00:32:07.781 --> 00:32:12.329
your share of the inheritance will be
used to establish a charitable foundation

493
00:32:12.329 --> 00:32:14.522
starting from five years
after Ms. Cha's death.

494
00:32:14.522 --> 00:32:16.807
Ms. Cha has said that she
would like for that foundation

495
00:32:16.807 --> 00:32:20.760
to assist single mothers
and their children.

496
00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:24.644
And she was considering making Ms. Yi Jin
the chairwoman of the foundation.

497
00:32:24.644 --> 00:32:27.279
Yi Jin is most suitable
for running an organization

498
00:32:27.279 --> 00:32:29.189
and she likes children, too.

499
00:32:29.189 --> 00:32:31.583
Do you think I'll be
good at doing that?

500
00:32:31.583 --> 00:32:34.453
I've always wanted to
try doing something like that.

501
00:32:35.054 --> 00:32:36.127
Big Sis.

502
00:32:36.127 --> 00:32:38.156
How old are you turning
this year, again?

503
00:32:38.156 --> 00:32:40.107
38...

504
00:32:40.107 --> 00:32:43.398
Oh, you're definitely still
young enough to have a child!

505
00:32:48.422 --> 00:32:53.422
<font color="#fcc89b">[DramaFever Ver] tvN E05 Mother</font>
<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

506
00:32:58.612 --> 00:33:01.951
You need to know the dangers
associated with doing this, okay?

507
00:33:01.951 --> 00:33:04.707
I have no idea why you need this,
or what you'll be using it for.

508
00:33:04.707 --> 00:33:06.002
I don't want to know, either.

509
00:33:06.002 --> 00:33:08.097
I'm only worried
about one thing, which is

510
00:33:08.097 --> 00:33:11.615
what will happen to Madam if you
take that and try to leave the country

511
00:33:11.615 --> 00:33:14.020
and get caught at immigrations.

512
00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:17.396
Let's not get into you, okay?
This is your choice, after all.

513
00:33:17.396 --> 00:33:18.877
However, it's different
when it comes to Madam.

514
00:33:18.877 --> 00:33:22.036
She hasn't had any scandals
for the past 30 years

515
00:33:22.036 --> 00:33:25.026
and I worked so hard to make sure that
her name was never on any online posts

516
00:33:25.026 --> 00:33:26.886
so that she could focus on
just acting.

517
00:33:26.886 --> 00:33:29.717
So do you think I'd allow her
name to be on the 9 o' clock news

518
00:33:29.717 --> 00:33:31.877
when I've worked so hard
for all these years?

519
00:33:31.877 --> 00:33:34.576
That's why I'm entrusting this to you.

520
00:33:35.448 --> 00:33:37.105
That's why, yesterday...

521
00:33:37.674 --> 00:33:41.421
I met with the biggest name
in the business.

522
00:33:43.476 --> 00:33:45.028
Hey.

523
00:33:45.814 --> 00:33:48.804
You know that the NIS is
the first to know about

524
00:33:48.804 --> 00:33:50.240
celebrities' personal lives, right?

525
00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:53.782
How is it that Mister and Soo Jin
have so much to discuss?

526
00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:59.235
Well, if he gets started on how long
he had to search for Soo Jin

527
00:33:59.235 --> 00:34:01.684
it's impossible to stop him.

528
00:34:06.061 --> 00:34:08.039
Hey, you should smile too, all right?

529
00:34:08.039 --> 00:34:10.601
Yi Jin is staring at us
from over there.

530
00:34:11.202 --> 00:34:14.021
At any rate, I had to go through
three people and drink with six

531
00:34:14.021 --> 00:34:17.577
in order to be able to meet that man.

532
00:34:17.577 --> 00:34:19.509
What kind of person is he?

533
00:34:19.509 --> 00:34:20.958
The less you know, the better.

534
00:34:20.958 --> 00:34:22.567
Curiosity killed the cat.

535
00:34:23.775 --> 00:34:25.693
He said it'll take two weeks.

536
00:34:27.797 --> 00:34:29.431
That's too long.

537
00:34:29.431 --> 00:34:30.911
They'll be sending us the invoice soon

538
00:34:30.911 --> 00:34:32.615
so have the money ready, okay?

539
00:34:33.126 --> 00:34:34.173
All right.

540
00:34:34.173 --> 00:34:37.998
That's the spot we talk in when
we're discussing secret matters.

541
00:34:37.998 --> 00:34:42.240
That's where Big Sis yelled at me after
she caught me smoking in middle school.

542
00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:44.940
Oh, and when I found out
that I was pregnant with twins

543
00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:48.833
that's where I cried in Hyun Jin's arms

544
00:34:48.833 --> 00:34:51.507
and debated whether I should
get married or get an abortion.

545
00:34:54.041 --> 00:34:55.414
Let's split up here.

546
00:35:07.624 --> 00:35:11.108
Is it true that you're missing a finger?

547
00:35:12.727 --> 00:35:13.809
Huh?

548
00:35:14.307 --> 00:35:16.842
I heard that you lost it
while you were in prison.

549
00:35:21.858 --> 00:35:23.006
Want to take a look?

550
00:35:33.948 --> 00:35:36.311
Have you heard other rumors
about me, too?

551
00:35:37.657 --> 00:35:39.972
That you killed someone.

552
00:35:41.381 --> 00:35:43.168
Doesn't that scare you?

553
00:35:43.168 --> 00:35:45.898
I feel like those are all lies.

554
00:35:45.898 --> 00:35:48.352
You're a nice person, after all.

555
00:35:48.352 --> 00:35:50.836
And my mom said that
you seem like a nice person, too.

556
00:35:51.490 --> 00:35:55.434
My mom is a scientist,
so she knows everything.

557
00:35:56.689 --> 00:35:57.921
All right.

558
00:35:59.617 --> 00:36:01.108
Yoon Bok.

559
00:36:02.195 --> 00:36:06.046
I've gotten really old now...

560
00:36:06.568 --> 00:36:08.936
so can't you call me "Grandma"?

561
00:36:10.046 --> 00:36:11.626
Grandma?

562
00:36:12.887 --> 00:36:15.447
Can I call you "Granny Finger"?

563
00:36:16.552 --> 00:36:17.832
Sure.

564
00:36:39.352 --> 00:36:40.555
<i>Mom.</i>

565
00:36:40.555 --> 00:36:43.932
<i>Can't you stay home from work today?</i>

566
00:36:43.932 --> 00:36:46.941
What are you all going to eat
if I don't work?

567
00:36:46.941 --> 00:36:49.621
I won't eat anything today, then.

568
00:36:51.952 --> 00:36:53.166
You can...

569
00:36:54.253 --> 00:36:56.305
order some chicken and
eat it with Uncle later.

570
00:36:57.079 --> 00:36:58.110
Why not?

571
00:36:58.110 --> 00:36:59.794
Chicken is your favorite food, though.

572
00:37:00.796 --> 00:37:03.061
I'm scared of Uncle.

573
00:37:03.061 --> 00:37:04.881
Why would you be scared?

574
00:37:04.881 --> 00:37:06.974
He lived with us when
you were younger, after all.

575
00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:10.403
So Mi...

576
00:37:11.244 --> 00:37:13.432
Because of Uncle, So Mi...

577
00:37:14.472 --> 00:37:15.793
Shut it.

578
00:37:16.249 --> 00:37:18.789
So Mi died while I was bathing her.

579
00:37:19.275 --> 00:37:21.698
And she was always really sickly, anyway.

580
00:37:21.698 --> 00:37:23.142
That's not true.

581
00:37:23.965 --> 00:37:27.410
Uncle told So Mi that
they should take a bath together.

582
00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:29.532
So Mi was always really sickly

583
00:37:29.532 --> 00:37:32.961
so she had tubes attached to her shoulder
and arms, and other spots like that.

584
00:37:32.961 --> 00:37:36.099
But Uncle took all of those off her, and
took her to the bathroom to bathe her.

585
00:37:36.099 --> 00:37:38.602
And not too long after,
Uncle called you

586
00:37:38.602 --> 00:37:41.182
so you ran back here, crying.

587
00:37:41.698 --> 00:37:43.394
- And an ambulance came...
- Hey.

588
00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:45.738
Stop making things up.

589
00:37:45.738 --> 00:37:48.715
How could you remember that
when you were only five years old?

590
00:37:48.715 --> 00:37:51.751
If you have to go,
take Byung Gook with you.

591
00:37:51.751 --> 00:37:55.758
What if Uncle tries to
bathe Byung Gook, too?

592
00:38:12.365 --> 00:38:15.222
Why do you want to go to a concert
when you're not even feeling well?

593
00:38:15.222 --> 00:38:18.003
It's because I'm sick
that I'm going to a concert.

594
00:38:18.003 --> 00:38:21.988
When people are truly ill,
music cannot make them feel anything.

595
00:38:21.988 --> 00:38:25.590
The Vivaldi piece that brought
one to tears 20 years ago

596
00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:28.053
sounds like nothing more
than mere noise.

597
00:38:28.053 --> 00:38:31.407
Do you have any idea
what it feels like to live like that?

598
00:38:31.407 --> 00:38:33.727
The desperation of a cancer patient

599
00:38:33.727 --> 00:38:37.093
who doesn't have many days left
to listen to music...

600
00:38:37.682 --> 00:38:39.727
Do you understand
what that feels like?

601
00:39:08.307 --> 00:39:09.401
Oh!

602
00:39:09.401 --> 00:39:10.771
There he is.

603
00:39:10.771 --> 00:39:12.130
Oh.

604
00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:13.967
Oh, I'm so scatterbrained!

605
00:39:13.967 --> 00:39:16.599
I had a fitting today,
but I completely forgot about it!

606
00:39:16.599 --> 00:39:18.289
Also, here, Soo Jin.

607
00:39:18.289 --> 00:39:20.026
See the concert with Doctor Jung.

608
00:39:20.026 --> 00:39:24.436
Oh yeah, did I tell you?
Doctor Jung is an excellent violinist.

609
00:39:32.525 --> 00:39:34.755
Does she have to shoot some
extra scenes again today?

610
00:39:35.477 --> 00:39:36.988
No.

611
00:39:36.988 --> 00:39:38.501
It's a fitting.

612
00:39:38.501 --> 00:39:41.224
The TV show is over now, so she can't
use the "extra scene" excuse.

613
00:39:41.224 --> 00:39:42.729
Oh.

614
00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:45.378
How is Yoon Bok?

615
00:39:45.892 --> 00:39:47.608
She's gotten a lot better.

616
00:39:47.608 --> 00:39:50.057
Her fever has gone down
and she coughs a lot less now.

617
00:39:50.057 --> 00:39:51.403
She's running around now.

618
00:39:51.403 --> 00:39:53.164
She's taking her medication, right?

619
00:39:53.164 --> 00:39:55.794
She can't stop taking it
just because she's gotten better.

620
00:39:55.794 --> 00:39:57.381
Yes, she's taking it.

621
00:39:59.597 --> 00:40:00.941
Give me the tickets.

622
00:40:09.227 --> 00:40:10.590
Go on now.

623
00:40:12.146 --> 00:40:14.396
Madam Cha doesn't know
about Yoon Bok, right?

624
00:40:15.410 --> 00:40:18.541
And I'm sure that had you on edge
while you were on your way here.

625
00:40:18.541 --> 00:40:20.626
Because you want to
hurry back to Yoon Bok.

626
00:40:22.104 --> 00:40:24.675
Please go. Yoon Bok will be waiting.

627
00:40:26.762 --> 00:40:27.798
Thank you.

628
00:40:27.798 --> 00:40:31.003
Also, I'd like to examine Yoon Bok.

629
00:40:31.003 --> 00:40:33.305
Shall I visit you two
where you're staying?

630
00:40:34.264 --> 00:40:36.184
That's... a bit...

631
00:40:36.691 --> 00:40:38.590
Then, based on how Yoon Bok is doing...

632
00:40:38.590 --> 00:40:40.407
there's a park around here, out front.

633
00:40:40.407 --> 00:40:42.930
There's a cafe there.
