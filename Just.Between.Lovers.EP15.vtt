No. I'll leave first. You should rest.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.040
Don't go.

4
00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.710
You're being weird.

5
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.300

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.300
I'm sorry.

38
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.400
What's going on? She didn't show up for work without any phone calls.

39
00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:08.300
We have to finish the blueprint today.

Look here.

41
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.600
Isn't it nice? It's much better than before, right?

42
00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.600
Look here, this. I did this.

46
00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.750
You did a good job.

47
00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:58.600
Yesterday, you—

48
00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:04.400
The voices you hear, it's Oppa Seong Jae's?

49
00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:08.100
When did you find out?

50
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.400
When I came here with you.

51
00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.600
When were you planning to tell me?

52
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.400
I wasn't going to tell you..

53
00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:25.650
I thought you'd be in peace that way.

54
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.500
Let's go. I'll come here next time.

55
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:38.200
No, I will tell Seong Jae's mother that it was me who asked to meet him there on that day.

56
00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:43.400
Don't. What's the point of telling her now?

57
00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:48.950
It's not necessary to know everything.

58
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.380
She's having a hard enough time mourning and missing him.

59
00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.400
You're just forcing her to hate you.

60
00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:19.210
You came here couple days ago too, right?

61
00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:21.200
Yes.

62
00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.500
Because of Seong Jae?

63
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:33.600
You... stopped by my house a few times before too, right?

64
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.300
<i>Excuse me, do you live here by chance?</i>

65
00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:00.370
<i>Here...</i>

66
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.200
<i>a few months ago, due to the shopping mall collapse—</i>

67
00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.800
<i>There isn't anyone like that here.</i>

<i>It is here.</i>

70
00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:18.800
<i>The people who used to live here</i>

71
00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.800
<i>they are all dead.</i>

72
00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:39.000
He seems kind hearted.

73
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.400
I thought he would be really scary looking.

74
00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:49.200
I don't have many pictures of him. That was taken on his school trip.

75
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.600
I guess he laughed often with his friends.

76
00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:59.070
Do you know my Seong Jae?

77
00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:03.950
Yes.

78
00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:11.800
I was with him until his final moments.

79
00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:18.690
I should have relayed the message back then.

80
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.290
Hyung said

81
00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:28.580
"I am sorry for non answering his phone and going out without telling you."

82
00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:36.630
He asked me to pass those words to his mother.

83
00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:50.220
I am sorry for being late.

84
00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:03.670
I am sorry.

85
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:06.880
Is that why you came?

86
00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:09.860
I didn't even know...

87
00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:11.970
I am sorry.

88
00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:35.010
Then I will come again next time.

89
00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:50.140
<i>I have something to tell you regarding Oppa Seong Jae. Please give me a call. Ha Moon Soo.</i>

90
00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:51.710
I am going.

91
00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:54.930
Not like this.

92
00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:58.580
I am going.

93
00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:03.490
You can't.

94
00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:07.770
If you leave like this,

95
00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:12.000
you're never going to see me again, right?

96
00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:21.130
Don't be like this.

97
00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:25.060
You don't have a problem with me?

98
00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:30.290
Of course not. Why would I—

99
00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:32.320
Instead of me,

100
00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.980
you should have escaped first.

101
00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:41.200
Then you didn't have to stay behind with Seong Jae,

102
00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:44.240
you wouldn't be hearing voices till now,

103
00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:48.470
and your body didn't have to be destroyed like this.

104
00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:52.150
If I hadn't asked Seong Jae to that place either—

105
00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:53.670
What kind of bullsh** are you saying?

106
00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:56.960
It's appalling that I left that place first because I wanted to save myself.

107
00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.910
I am appalled by me.

108
00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:04.540
Hey. Ha Moon Soo.

109
00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:09.380
Is it all your fault that I turned out like this?

110
00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:11.580
Do you wield so much influence like that?

111
00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:14.710
People dying at the hospital is all your fault too?

112
00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:18.310
Car accidents, plane crashes,

113
00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:21.680
thousands of lives lost in a war too, that's all your fault?

114
00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:24.520
All the shi*** things in the world, it's all your fault?

115
00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:35.070
Even in your ears... that sounds ridiculous, right?

116
00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:42.620
So, don't ever think like that.

117
00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:49.960
Even for a day, I want to be happy with you.

118
00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:55.320
Since the world is unfair, I must be happy many times more.

119
00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:58.090
Let me go.

120
00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:03.600
I told you that I won't let of your hand.

121
00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.250
Gang Doo.

122
00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:08.370
- Don't say it.
- Gang Doo.

123
00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:11.350
I don't want to hear it.

124
00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:13.940
It torments me to see you.

125
00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:18.410
It reminds me of what happened in the past,

126
00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:23.730
so I think I will end up hating myself.

Don't make the problem worse by triggering his sense of justice for some reason.

161
00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.790
Why aren't you answering your call?

162
00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:35.070
Why aren't you answering your sister's calls?

163
00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:43.470
Noona.

164
00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:49.240
You said this before.

165
00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:54.570
Don't be relieved thinking that this is the rock bottom.

166
00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:56.990
I did. Why?

167
00:20:56.990 --> 00:21:02.890
If this is not rock bottom, how many more underground levels are there?

168
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.110
Things are not going well with Moon Soo?

169
00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:17.090
Moon Soo said it torments her to be with me.

170
00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:22.780
Do I have to let her go then?

171
00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:26.300
Are you sure you'll be able to let her go?

172
00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:29.050
Rather than to see her suffer because of me,

173
00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:34.300
I thought it would be better for me to regret my decision alone.

174
00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:37.520
You don't like her enough. Seeing how you want to keep your pride.

175
00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:41.190
That's not true. Very much, really, greatly,

176
00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:46.210
really a lot, totally, ginormously, I like her.

177
00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:48.540
So it's driving me nuts.

178
00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:06.510
<i>Why didn't you go home?</i>

179
00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:08.770
<i>I've been waiting so I could see you.</i>

180
00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:15.570
<i>I'll come tomorrow, and the next day, and the day after that.</i>

181
00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:20.190
<i>I'll keep coming until I don't like you.</i>

182
00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:28.580
<i>Saint Moon Soo</i>

183
00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:48.520
<i>The phone has been turned off so you'll be redirected to the voicemail</i>

184
00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:09.560
<i>Not answering the call</i>

185
00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:22.850
So what was his name?

186
00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:24.480
What?

187
00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:30.280
The guy your'e dating, the guy who came to see you here.

188
00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:31.940
Why?

189
00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:36.330
What do you mean why? He's the guy you're dating,

190
00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:40.350
even if he doesn't live up to my standard, I should at least know his name.

191
00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:42.370
You don't have to know his name.

192
00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:45.190
Why? Are you afraid I will go seek him out?

193
00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:47.220
No.

194
00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:54.440
Since I won't be dating him anymore.

195
00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:59.950
I...I didn't mean to tell you to break up with him. As long as you're dating someone...

196
00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:04.490
Mom. I won't date anymore.

197
00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:06.630
Why not?

198
00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:11.140
He dumped you? That guy, when he doesn't have much, dumped you?

199
00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:13.630
I wish that was the case.

200
00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:19.320
It would be more comfortable for me if he had dumped me.

201
00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:27.670
I think I am destined to ruin other people's lives.

202
00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:29.660
What kind of nonsense is that?

203
00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:31.710
Who said so? Who said that?

204
00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:33.750
Who's the crazy bastard who said such thing?

205
00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:38.370
No one said that. I feel like that. I feel like that.

206
00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:43.460
Oh, what is she saying?

207
00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:45.500
Oh, this is upsetting.

208
00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:52.440
Gang Doo, 12 missed calls.

209
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:59.340
Not answering the phone is playing unfair.

210
00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:18.040
Joo Won.

211
00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:26.180
It's getting busy at the site, right? I appreciate your work.

212
00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:34.250
If things go as planned, do what you want and don't worry about the money.

213
00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:40.690
When Cheongyu wins another public project next time, I'll give it to you.

214
00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:45.130
If this is about the bones we found, there's not much I can do...

215
00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:52.300
What do you mean there isn't? There's one thing. Not to talk about it.

216
00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:56.900
The bones and construction site have nothing to do with each other.

217
00:25:56.900 --> 00:26:00.820
Since we dug it up, we can move forward with construction.

218
00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:02.780
However...

219
00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:11.150
In an incident where the news is leaked and the victim's family has been notified.

220
00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:14.180
The family would want to find it somehow.

221
00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:20.330
And if things get out of hand and the construction stops... were you very scared of that?

222
00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:23.140
Why are you here?

223
00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:25.820
This bastard's crossing the line, butting in everywhere...

224
00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:29.020
I'm most qualified to butt in this matter here!

225
00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:33.410
Why did you come here?

226
00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:36.140
This bastard's crossing the line, butting in everywhere...

227
00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:39.430
I'm most qualified to butt in this matter here!

228
00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:40.850
Did you call him?

229
00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:44.100
Director Jeong didn't tell you I was coming?

230
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:47.500
We can't work together. Seriously.

231
00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:01.800
Digging up bones isn't our responsibility.

232
00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:06.520
The police should take care of that matter. It's a separate matter when it comes to building a structure safely.

233
00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:09.590
But why do you think Director Jeong sent me here?

234
00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:12.690
I think I might know.

235
00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:16.310
Don't you get it?

236
00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:21.470
We're not trying to hide it. I don't think we need to notify them intentionally.

237
00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:26.580
If the site stops working, the workers don't have anywhere to go.

238
00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:29.940
People who are living so hard... they shouldn't have to suffer.

239
00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:33.570
If you start compromising one thing at a time with nice words like that...

240
00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:38.930
People who would've enjoyed a glass of soju after work... You can put them in danger.

241
00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:46.920
I wish you wouldn't do that, CEO.

242
00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:50.350
If you do that...

243
00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:54.100
My father couldn't do it.

244
00:27:55.690 --> 00:27:58.170
But I'll stop you.

245
00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:06.740
Hey, I never called for you so get out. Get out!

246
00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:10.200
I'll leave even if you didn't tell me to.

247
00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:14.250
Stuff yourself full and live a long life.

248
00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:34.840
Those guys... doubling up on me...

249
00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:41.480
Why did you send Lee Kang Doo there yesterday?

250
00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:44.960
- In case you wavered.
- What?

251
00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:49.030
Isn't that the reason you placed Lee Gang Doo at the site?

252
00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:54.310
- Don't just spew out.
- No, I'm saying this because I think that's what you're doing.

253
00:28:54.310 --> 00:29:00.560
Ha Moon Soo and Lee Gang Doo. Weren't you cautious of yourself watching those two, weren't you?

254
00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:03.790
What do you know?

255
00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:11.500
The Area B you're in charge of...

256
00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:19.960
It's exactly the same as the blueprint from 13 years ago. Including the structural design and floor finishing. Didn't you think I'd know?

257
00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:24.770
You and I both know there's no problem with the design.

258
00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:28.060
We also know the structure isn't built only by the design alone.

259
00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:31.970
Then, it was my father's fault who compromised at the site...

260
00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:38.410
No. What you were going to do... Continue on.

261
00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:45.410
So that my oppa doesn't look down on you, don't falter.

262
00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:48.940
He ordered him around then, too.

263
00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:55.340
He's doing that because he learned his mistake then.

264
00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:06.100
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Fated Lovers Team @ viki</i>

266
00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:17.820
I got it now, so listen to me this once.

267
00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:23.720
Even if it's hard for you to face me...

268
00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:28.830
The memorial... Let's finish what we began together.

269
00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:34.400
You said so yourself.

270
00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:40.720
Until we finish the memorial park.

271
00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:45.020
See me until then.

272
00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:49.330
I won't bother you more.

273
00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:57.470
It's what you said to me.

274
00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:01.380
Okay.

275
00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:06.030
Let's go eat first.

276
00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:07.270
I don't want to.

277
00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:10.170
Why not? That's part of work too.

278
00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:12.370
You need food to gain energy.

279
00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:15.420
Do you know what time it is? You still didn't eat?

280
00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:19.330
I'm hungry.

281
00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:22.470
Eat with me.

282
00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:41.560
You said meat should be grilled, not drowned in soup. What made you crave this?

283
00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:45.300
I can't be picky to be healthy.

284
00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:48.510
I need to eat well and be healthy to not worry you.

285
00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:57.520
Breathe. I can tell you're eating holding your breath.

286
00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:01.940
I'm not. Do you know how I'm eating this like an adult?

287
00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:08.510
Eat more of this.

288
00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:15.270
Go on, eat.

289
00:32:50.550 --> 00:32:54.490
What are you doing here? I told you to wait inside.

290
00:32:54.490 --> 00:32:56.360
See? You're indigested.

291
00:32:56.360 --> 00:33:00.520
I'm not! I just ate it too fast because it was so good.

292
00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:05.020
Take this.

293
00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:10.520
Don't try too hard because of me.

294
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.530
Why do you keep saying it's for you?

295
00:33:17.530 --> 00:33:19.200
Wait for me.

296
00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:23.170
Moon Soo.

297
00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:27.710
I need to go back for a meeting.

298

Listen to me first.

299

I'm not doing anything because of you.

300
00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:38.250
Don't feel sorry for me.

301
00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:41.510
I need to be thankful for you.

302
00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:43.340
You already...

303
00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:47.060

477

Something came up. And you?

482
00:53:28.030 --> 00:53:37.490
As for me... The memorial. We should finish it.

483
00:53:38.650 --> 00:53:40.720
Let's make it ourselves.

484
00:53:43.230 --> 00:53:48.390
I know it's hard to look at it. You'll remember when you look at this.

485
00:53:49.890 --> 00:53:57.410
So that we won't forget... I think stuff like this is what we were looking for.

486
00:53:59.790 --> 00:54:04.810
Wasn't it like that for you? So the truck that was carrying all these...

487
00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:10.100
What?

488
00:54:10.100 --> 00:54:13.050
Did you get these yourself?

489
00:54:14.430 --> 00:54:19.640
Yeah. I wanted you to compliment me.

490
00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:24.250
Why every time? Why do you suffer alone? Making me feel bad.

491
00:54:24.250 --> 00:54:29.490
I told you before. Suffering comes in a bunch.

492
00:54:29.490 --> 00:54:31.850
What's the use of suffering together?

493
00:54:31.850 --> 00:54:39.230
Anyway, I brought back similar things. I have no idea what to do with it though.

494
00:54:39.230 --> 00:54:42.560

No. Do we have the Shinsudong business leaflet sample come out?

But CEO... Did you know that Unni was quitting?

502
00:55:54.460 --> 00:56:01.290
She said she's quitting after this project. Unni is very detail oriented and does good work.

503
00:56:01.290 --> 00:56:03.270
So, if she continues to work with us...

504
00:56:03.270 --> 00:56:08.050
I'm sure she has her reasons for wanting to quit.

This is the blueprint of the shopping mall that collapsed.

506
00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:23.510
I heard the architect who built it committed suicide. Have you heard?

507
00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:26.340
I heard.

508
00:56:27.610 --> 00:56:33.270
He said a word of apology and committed suicide irresponsibly... According to Ha Moon Soo.

509
00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:37.390
That's not true. Unni didn't say that.

510
00:56:39.230 --> 00:56:45.320
You got a cold all right. Take a day off tomorrow and rest. Don't spread it everywhere.

511
00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:59.500
Unni, it's a scary. The soul who committed suicide comes in and...

512
00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:04.280
There's no problem with the design itself. The structural change was perfect, too.

513
00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:06.420
Huh? Why did he die then?

514
00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:12.240
I know. What's the remaining family supposed to do?

515
00:57:13.230 --> 00:57:19.610
He should've lived if it wasn't his fault. He should've lived and got to the bottom of it.

516
00:57:19.610 --> 00:57:24.810
Think about it. What if death was the only way to prove injustice felt in his heart?

517
00:57:24.810 --> 00:57:27.790
How terrible of a world is that?

518

00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:53.700
The pillar?

520
00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:59.820
Yes. I'm thinking of building the memorial out of the pillar that collapsed at that time.

521
00:58:00.650 --> 00:58:02.820
The headquarters won't be too happy.

522

The blueprint for the shopping mall that collapsed... I reviewed it again.

It has the same foundation as the Yeongudong building you built.

That's...

526

It showed how much contemplation went into it.

527
00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:28.950
I didn't understand why such an accident had happened.

528
00:58:28.950 --> 00:58:32.520
But I remembered what you had said, CEO.

529
00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:37.090
An accident... It rarely happens that bad guys cause it intentionally.

530
00:58:37.090 --> 00:58:41.920
An accident happens when hard-working people make a small mistake.

531
00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:45.200
Rather than being an adequately good person to everyone...

532
00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:50.190
Even if they talk bad about you because you're picky, it's right to nitpick everything.

533
00:58:50.190 --> 00:58:54.250
So, I want to do it as I learned from you, CEO.

534
00:58:58.310 --> 00:59:03.450

01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:12.220
Moon Soo!

628
01:10:16.650 --> 01:10:25.330
<i>Ha Moon Soo! I have to tell you something. Can you let me see you?</i>

629
01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:31.890
<i>Moon Soo, I'm sick right now.</i>

630
01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:35.860
<i>I'm really sick.</i>

631
01:10:35.860 --> 01:10:39.010
I might faint soon.

632
01:10:40.850 --> 01:10:46.520
Open your window and hear me out.

633
01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:52.120
Then, I'll go. I'll never come back here.

634
01:10:53.470 --> 01:10:56.550
Show me your face for the last time.

635
01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:06.140
I feel like I'm going to faint.

636
01:11:08.590 --> 01:11:11.590
I'll faint after counting to ten.

<i>♫ I don’t want to say anything
Just want to look at you ♫</i>

<i>♫ I don’t want to forget your face
Even for a single day ♫</i>

<i>♫ My eyes that look at you
I didn’t know it would be this deep ♫</i>

645
01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:56.170
<i>♫ My hands that hold you
I didn’t know they trembled this much ♫</i>

646

<i>[ Just Between Lovers ]</i>

649
01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:09.810
<i>What was his name? Sounded like a puppy...</i>

650
01:12:09.810 --> 01:12:10.950
<i>Gang Do?</i>

651
01:12:10.950 --> 01:12:13.890
<i>Mom, what do you mean Gang Do? Gang Doo.</i>

652
01:12:13.890 --> 01:12:18.890
<i>You were smiling so big when you were seeing him.
So, his name is Gang Doo?</i>

653
01:12:18.890 --> 01:12:22.770
<i>Yeah. Lee Gang Doo.</i>

654
01:12:22.770 --> 01:12:28.590
<i>He's so handsome without any cuts.</i>

<i>He's got big hands.</i>

<i>You think it's your greed that wants that surgery, right?</i>

658
01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:44.640
<i>No matter how difficult it is for you, it's our greed that wants you alive next to us.</i>

659
01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:47.120
<i>It's not something you can give just because you want to.</i>

660
01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:51.910
<i>Because we're not related? Then, I can do it if I marry Gang Doo, right? I can marry him right away.</i>

<i>And that's you. Who cares about sense of responsibility?</i>

664
