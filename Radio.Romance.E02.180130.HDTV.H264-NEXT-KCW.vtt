1
00:00:10.728 --> 00:00:11.898
Ready?

2
00:00:12.567 --> 00:00:13.697
Action.

3
00:00:36.858 --> 00:00:38.587
Cut! Great job!

4
00:01:36.888 --> 00:01:37.888
(Song Geu Rim)

5
00:02:38.447 --> 00:02:39.778
Good work today.

6
00:03:06.678 --> 00:03:07.877
That hurts.

7
00:03:28.227 --> 00:03:29.498
What's wrong with you?

8
00:03:29.868 --> 00:03:31.368
Will taking you home do?

9
00:03:32.428 --> 00:03:34.768
The drama world is
repaying the drama world,

10
00:03:34.768 --> 00:03:36.097
so let's call it even.

11
00:03:36.338 --> 00:03:39.468
And don't follow me around
anymore.

12
00:03:39.577 --> 00:03:40.637
Okay?

13
00:03:41.338 --> 00:03:43.278
I'll never do radio.

14
00:03:44.148 --> 00:03:46.947
Forget it. I'll go alone
even if I have to crawl.

15
00:04:03.167 --> 00:04:05.667
Put me down!

16
00:04:08.438 --> 00:04:10.268
I said to put me down.

17
00:04:20.077 --> 00:04:22.817
Do you hate me that much?

18
00:04:23.017 --> 00:04:24.017
Why?

19
00:04:24.217 --> 00:04:27.158
Or do you hate the radio
that much? Why?

20
00:04:27.457 --> 00:04:29.288
What do you hate so much?

21
00:04:29.288 --> 00:04:31.587
Why must I tell you that?

22
00:04:36.098 --> 00:04:38.567
You tripped me on purpose
four years ago...

23
00:04:38.567 --> 00:04:40.567
at the charity ball,
didn't you?

24
00:04:40.868 --> 00:04:42.137
Do you think I'm stupid?

25
00:04:42.137 --> 00:04:43.868
You say things
to anger me...

26
00:04:43.868 --> 00:04:45.408
and start fights with me.

27
00:04:45.608 --> 00:04:48.007
What did I do to you?

28
00:04:48.007 --> 00:04:50.548
What's your problem?

29
00:05:13.967 --> 00:05:16.137
Where are we going?

30
00:05:16.938 --> 00:05:18.137
Let me off.

31
00:05:18.137 --> 00:05:20.038
I'm not going
to the hospital.

32
00:05:23.978 --> 00:05:26.248
How can you ignore me
at a time like this?

33
00:05:42.627 --> 00:05:43.627
Wait...

34
00:05:44.267 --> 00:05:46.467
How did you know
I live here?

35
00:05:47.197 --> 00:05:50.538
How did you know
I live here?

36
00:05:51.038 --> 00:05:53.808
- Get out.
- How did you know?

37
00:05:53.808 --> 00:05:55.178
Do you need me
to carry you out again?

38
00:05:56.577 --> 00:05:58.007
Are you not getting out...

39
00:05:58.007 --> 00:05:59.777
because you want me
to hold you again?

40
00:06:24.238 --> 00:06:25.337
Ji Soo Ho.

41
00:06:25.507 --> 00:06:28.308
You can't just disappear
from a shoot like that.

42
00:06:28.308 --> 00:06:29.777
What about your schedule?

43
00:06:30.408 --> 00:06:33.418
You have to tell me
if you're leaving.

44
00:06:33.418 --> 00:06:35.877
It doesn't matter if it's
2 minutes or 2 hours,

45
00:06:35.877 --> 00:06:37.488
you would be considered
missing to us.

46
00:06:49.058 --> 00:06:51.168
Did you drive
that girl home?

47
00:06:51.428 --> 00:06:52.668
You can go now.

48
00:06:54.038 --> 00:06:56.707
I took care of the
commercial shoot.

49
00:06:57.207 --> 00:06:59.108
You never acted
like this before...

50
00:06:59.577 --> 00:07:00.678
Mr. Kim.

51
00:07:01.108 --> 00:07:03.877
I told you that you can go
with a smile.

52
00:07:13.688 --> 00:07:15.618
- What is this?
- Open the door.

53
00:07:15.618 --> 00:07:16.627
(Visiting system,
I can hold my tongue)

54
00:07:16.627 --> 00:07:17.858
Ji Soo Ho.

55
00:07:19.558 --> 00:07:20.598
What is this?

56
00:07:20.757 --> 00:07:22.428
Do you have fans
stalking you?

57
00:07:22.798 --> 00:07:23.967
If you don't open up,

58
00:07:23.967 --> 00:07:26.197
I could make
a scene out here.

59
00:07:26.197 --> 00:07:27.798
Who is this guy?

60
00:07:28.598 --> 00:07:29.668
I'll get rid of him.

61
00:07:35.777 --> 00:07:36.877
I told you to go.

62
00:07:43.317 --> 00:07:44.447
Who are you?

63
00:07:46.788 --> 00:07:48.257
I'm Ji Soo Ho's manager.

64
00:07:50.387 --> 00:07:52.087
All right. Excuse me.

65
00:08:05.808 --> 00:08:07.308
Maybe
I should be your manager.

66
00:08:07.308 --> 00:08:08.837
Why do you have
so much stuff?

67
00:08:09.848 --> 00:08:11.048
I'm going to live here.

68
00:08:12.447 --> 00:08:13.447
I entered
medical school...

69
00:08:13.577 --> 00:08:15.947
as a top student and
graduated with top scores.

70
00:08:15.947 --> 00:08:17.387
Did you know that?

71
00:08:19.817 --> 00:08:21.188
You won't
get your treatment...

72
00:08:21.188 --> 00:08:23.058
nor come in
for consultation.

73
00:08:23.058 --> 00:08:24.827
You won't listen to me,
so...

74
00:08:24.827 --> 00:08:25.827
So?

75
00:08:27.197 --> 00:08:29.298
I will follow you around
24 hours a day.

76
00:08:29.868 --> 00:08:31.267
You're in for trouble.

77
00:08:31.827 --> 00:08:33.567
I'm hungry.
Do you have any food?

78
00:08:41.607 --> 00:08:43.077
That sounds like fun.

79
00:08:43.347 --> 00:08:45.648
Do I get to take writers
to hotels too?

80
00:08:47.977 --> 00:08:49.987
I never came here
with a writer before.

81
00:08:56.327 --> 00:08:58.388
Why are you
up in my face?

82
00:08:59.758 --> 00:09:00.758
Pardon?

83
00:09:00.997 --> 00:09:02.457
Why do you...

84
00:09:02.898 --> 00:09:05.168
keep showing up
in front of me?

85
00:09:07.138 --> 00:09:09.038
Gosh, that Ji Soo Ho...

86
00:09:16.247 --> 00:09:17.548
Song Geu Rim?

87
00:09:18.107 --> 00:09:19.107
Yes.

88
00:09:19.508 --> 00:09:21.518
I think they're trying
to recruit Soo Ho...

89
00:09:21.577 --> 00:09:23.548
as their radio DJ.

90
00:09:23.918 --> 00:09:25.617
She would chase him around
during the shoot.

91
00:09:25.788 --> 00:09:27.188
He missed his shoot
for a commercial...

92
00:09:27.188 --> 00:09:28.188
because he drove her home.

93
00:09:28.188 --> 00:09:29.317
Get to the point.

94
00:09:31.087 --> 00:09:32.357
What does Soo Ho think?

95
00:09:33.457 --> 00:09:35.097
I'm not sure yet,

96
00:09:35.697 --> 00:09:36.997
but I think
he could be interested.

97
00:09:36.997 --> 00:09:39.538
Soo Ho doesn't have
a phone or a manager.

98
00:09:39.538 --> 00:09:41.567
That's why I asked you
to follow him around.

99
00:09:42.298 --> 00:09:44.808
However, you're always...

100
00:09:45.337 --> 00:09:47.278
disappointing me.

101
00:09:52.977 --> 00:09:54.418
(Jin Tae Ri)

102
00:09:56.388 --> 00:09:57.747
You're dismissed.

103
00:09:57.847 --> 00:09:58.847
Okay.

104
00:10:08.597 --> 00:10:09.768
Ms. Nam!

105
00:10:09.997 --> 00:10:12.597
Are there any updates
regarding the contract...

106
00:10:12.597 --> 00:10:14.538
with Ji Soo Ho
we talked about before?

107
00:10:15.038 --> 00:10:17.867
I'm with some reporters
right now,

108
00:10:17.867 --> 00:10:20.008
and I'm itching to talk.

109
00:10:22.278 --> 00:10:24.378
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

110
00:10:24.747 --> 00:10:25.947
What is this?

111
00:10:26.577 --> 00:10:27.817
Hey.

112
00:10:28.117 --> 00:10:31.947
I always had Ms. Choi
do my hair for years.

113
00:10:32.087 --> 00:10:35.357
Can someone
explain to me...

114
00:10:35.357 --> 00:10:36.888
why a rookie
is touching my hair?

115
00:10:37.087 --> 00:10:38.788
I'll do it properly.

116
00:10:40.857 --> 00:10:42.758
Stop touching my hair.

117
00:10:42.758 --> 00:10:45.567
I told you to get
Ms. Choi here.

118
00:10:45.567 --> 00:10:47.997
Yes, thank you.

119
00:10:50.438 --> 00:10:52.408
Gosh. Hello, Tae Ri.

120
00:10:57.247 --> 00:10:59.548
I've been watching
your 5pm drama.

121
00:11:11.558 --> 00:11:13.158
Hey!

122
00:11:16.158 --> 00:11:18.967
I'm your senior,
but you didn't say hello.

123
00:11:18.967 --> 00:11:21.168
I came out
to get your greeting.

124
00:11:23.668 --> 00:11:25.237
Do you have a problem
recognizing faces?

125
00:11:25.867 --> 00:11:29.178
Or maybe you never had
a television at home.

126
00:11:29.878 --> 00:11:32.707
Don't you know
how much earlier...

127
00:11:32.707 --> 00:11:35.048
I debuted before you...

128
00:11:35.048 --> 00:11:36.888
and appeared
on television?

129
00:11:38.117 --> 00:11:39.487
What is she talking about?

130
00:11:41.158 --> 00:11:43.388
Hey. Listen.

131
00:11:46.758 --> 00:11:50.097
Do you want to give me
a proper hello,

132
00:11:50.197 --> 00:11:53.737
or do you want to get
your hair ripped out...

133
00:11:53.737 --> 00:11:55.867
and get your name
in the headlines with me?

134
00:12:03.548 --> 00:12:04.808
Hey.

135
00:12:06.107 --> 00:12:08.648
If you don't
say hello again next time,

136
00:12:08.847 --> 00:12:11.888
I'll really
pull your hair out. Okay?

137
00:12:18.388 --> 00:12:19.597
Mr. Lee.

138
00:12:19.827 --> 00:12:21.628
Why did you ask me
to come here?

139
00:12:21.957 --> 00:12:23.128
What happened
to your foot?

140
00:12:26.398 --> 00:12:27.737
Well...

141
00:12:28.337 --> 00:12:30.408
Something happened.

142
00:12:30.967 --> 00:12:32.237
Mr. Lee...

143
00:12:32.237 --> 00:12:33.237
Come in.

144
00:12:49.518 --> 00:12:52.158
- This desk is for you.
- Pardon?

145
00:12:52.158 --> 00:12:54.457
Your desk is gone
because you got fired.

146
00:13:04.808 --> 00:13:07.577
I used to send in
a lot of postcards too.

147
00:13:11.247 --> 00:13:12.278
Isn't this place nice?

148
00:13:13.018 --> 00:13:14.018
Yes.

149
00:13:14.418 --> 00:13:16.247
It's nice, but...

150
00:13:16.247 --> 00:13:17.447
What about Ji Soo Ho?

151
00:13:19.758 --> 00:13:20.857
Well...

152
00:13:22.158 --> 00:13:24.258
I should talk to you
about him.

153
00:13:25.058 --> 00:13:27.658
Mr. Lee, I have something
to tell you.

154
00:13:31.367 --> 00:13:33.938
Let's talk outside.

155
00:13:37.867 --> 00:13:39.778
I met with Ji Soo Ho,

156
00:13:39.778 --> 00:13:42.278
and he's not a good fit
for radio.

157
00:13:42.278 --> 00:13:44.878
There are candidates
better than him.

158
00:13:44.878 --> 00:13:47.148
We don't even have
a concept yet.

159
00:13:47.148 --> 00:13:48.747
We can't cast a DJ...

160
00:13:48.747 --> 00:13:51.247
to find out later
he doesn't fit our theme.

161
00:13:51.247 --> 00:13:53.487
Are you saying he said no?

162
00:13:53.487 --> 00:13:56.188
No,
that's not what I mean.

163
00:13:57.658 --> 00:13:58.727
How is Oh Ji Soo?

164
00:13:58.727 --> 00:14:00.457
She's really hot
these days.

165
00:14:00.457 --> 00:14:01.597
So he won't do it?

166
00:14:01.597 --> 00:14:03.367
I mean...

167
00:14:03.867 --> 00:14:06.567
Why does it have to be
Ji Soo Ho?

168
00:14:07.038 --> 00:14:10.867
I was trying
not to go this far,

169
00:14:11.438 --> 00:14:15.477
but Ji Soo Ho
is completely crazy.

170
00:14:19.508 --> 00:14:22.747
That's okay.
I'm more crazy.

171
00:14:25.148 --> 00:14:26.148
But...

172
00:14:28.457 --> 00:14:29.457
Ji Soo Ho...

173
00:14:30.288 --> 00:14:32.357
doesn't look like
a radio person, does he?

174
00:14:32.727 --> 00:14:34.827
I think he would
totally look down on us.

175
00:14:35.128 --> 00:14:37.268
How did you know?

176
00:14:37.398 --> 00:14:38.428
Geu Rim.

177
00:14:39.638 --> 00:14:41.697
He's the most unlikely
person...

178
00:14:41.697 --> 00:14:44.138
to become friendly
with radio.

179
00:14:45.337 --> 00:14:48.178
Isn't that something
we should make happen?

180
00:14:50.347 --> 00:14:51.947
I have one more reason,

181
00:14:53.648 --> 00:14:55.317
but I'll tell you
once you recruit him.

182
00:14:57.648 --> 00:14:59.487
Are you serious?

183
00:15:02.388 --> 00:15:04.288
What do I do?

184
00:15:23.077 --> 00:15:26.817
(Dear Moon Sung Woo...)

185
00:15:30.587 --> 00:15:32.347
If you're fired, go away.

186
00:15:33.117 --> 00:15:36.327
Come on,
don't be like that.

187
00:15:36.727 --> 00:15:38.487
Why are you playing
hard to get?

188
00:15:39.028 --> 00:15:42.197
What are you so dying
to talk to me about?

189
00:15:42.658 --> 00:15:45.597
You have been a DJ
for 30 years.

190
00:15:45.928 --> 00:15:47.837
You persuaded listeners
all over the world.

191
00:15:47.837 --> 00:15:51.067
You're a radio star
who lasted for so long.

192
00:15:51.737 --> 00:15:54.038
That's why
you should tell me.

193
00:15:54.077 --> 00:15:55.278
Tell you what?

194
00:15:55.508 --> 00:15:58.308
How to persuade someone
that hates radios.

195
00:15:58.477 --> 00:16:02.247
You made me into a writer.
You can't ignore me now.

196
00:16:03.987 --> 00:16:05.388
Don't blame it on me.

197
00:16:05.418 --> 00:16:06.788
It's true.

198
00:16:07.587 --> 00:16:11.028
My mom and I have been
your fans for 10 years.

199
00:16:11.128 --> 00:16:12.827
Look. I probably sent...

200
00:16:12.827 --> 00:16:15.357
over 100 postcards
to your show.

201
00:16:15.697 --> 00:16:18.727
I learned Korean and music
through your show.

202
00:16:18.727 --> 00:16:21.197
I even learned life
and writing.

203
00:16:21.737 --> 00:16:24.567
Then why are you
so bad at writing?

204
00:16:27.438 --> 00:16:29.408
What is it
that you want me to do?

205
00:16:29.977 --> 00:16:33.477
How can I help you
recruit Ji Soo Ho?

206
00:16:34.617 --> 00:16:37.847
Mom and I got through
hard times thanks to you.

207
00:16:38.317 --> 00:16:40.217
Just like
how you convinced me,

208
00:16:40.217 --> 00:16:43.258
tell me how I can
convince Ji Soo Ho...

209
00:16:43.428 --> 00:16:46.658
I was convinced by radio
not because...

210
00:16:47.128 --> 00:16:49.528
of a strategy
but due to sincerity.

211
00:16:52.898 --> 00:16:54.967
I'll get going.

212
00:16:55.168 --> 00:16:57.737
Thank you. I love you.

213
00:17:03.107 --> 00:17:04.947
Do you still not want
a phone?

214
00:17:05.747 --> 00:17:06.817
If you don't want
a manager,

215
00:17:06.817 --> 00:17:07.847
how about a secretary?

216
00:17:08.577 --> 00:17:10.618
It wouldn't be
my secretary but yours.

217
00:17:11.118 --> 00:17:12.247
Whichever.

218
00:17:12.648 --> 00:17:13.717
I don't need one.

219
00:17:14.757 --> 00:17:16.828
Then
should I fire Mr. Kim too?

220
00:17:18.057 --> 00:17:20.598
I hired him
because you wanted him.

221
00:17:20.858 --> 00:17:23.997
However, you are turning
Mr. Kim into a scarecrow.

222
00:17:27.967 --> 00:17:30.267
We'll talk about
business now.

223
00:17:31.267 --> 00:17:33.078
(Documentary film
production proposal)

224
00:17:34.977 --> 00:17:38.378
They want to shoot a film
about our family.

225
00:17:39.007 --> 00:17:40.947
The director
is Kim Sang Soo.

226
00:17:41.017 --> 00:17:44.688
We will handle all product
placement and marketing.

227
00:17:46.588 --> 00:17:49.828
I thought we did enough.
Must we sell ourselves?

228
00:17:50.588 --> 00:17:51.658
Of course.

229
00:17:52.658 --> 00:17:55.398
Just walking and breathing
can get you money.

230
00:17:56.057 --> 00:17:58.997
You must know how much
it would be in a year.

231
00:18:00.168 --> 00:18:01.237
I won't do it.

232
00:18:03.438 --> 00:18:05.908
You missed a schedule
last night.

233
00:18:06.707 --> 00:18:10.447
It cost a lot to stop
articles ruining our name.

234
00:18:12.207 --> 00:18:14.477
I didn't want
to bring this up.

235
00:18:24.088 --> 00:18:25.787
It's your birthday
next month.

236
00:18:26.457 --> 00:18:28.158
I'm giving you an early
birthday present...

237
00:18:28.158 --> 00:18:29.668
since it's getting cold.

238
00:18:40.138 --> 00:18:41.277
Son.

239
00:18:43.007 --> 00:18:45.108
Didn't I tell you?

240
00:18:46.517 --> 00:18:49.247
What you're good at,
what you're bad at,

241
00:18:49.247 --> 00:18:50.547
and what you just do...

242
00:18:51.188 --> 00:18:52.787
Even breathing...

243
00:18:53.418 --> 00:18:55.487
could harm me.

244
00:18:59.658 --> 00:19:01.557
I'll set the meeting with
the director next week.

245
00:19:02.297 --> 00:19:04.668
We'll follow our script
as always.

246
00:19:10.368 --> 00:19:11.608
I won't do it.

247
00:19:12.138 --> 00:19:14.578
I don't think I can smile
in front of the cameras...

248
00:19:16.207 --> 00:19:17.608
running around me
for 24 hours.

249
00:19:29.517 --> 00:19:31.858
Your dad went to a shoot
overseas.

250
00:19:31.858 --> 00:19:33.858
We'll have a party
on our own.

251
00:19:33.997 --> 00:19:35.098
Okay.

252
00:19:35.858 --> 00:19:38.898
The candles are dripping.
Hurry and blow them out.

253
00:19:47.537 --> 00:19:48.537
Happy birthday.

254
00:19:58.088 --> 00:19:59.188
Soo Ho.

255
00:20:01.588 --> 00:20:03.987
I have something to say
for your birthday.

256
00:20:11.297 --> 00:20:12.527
You are not...

257
00:20:13.338 --> 00:20:14.767
my son.

258
00:20:19.408 --> 00:20:23.047
So, what you're good at,

259
00:20:23.047 --> 00:20:25.777
what you're bad at,
what you just do,

260
00:20:25.947 --> 00:20:27.578
and even your breathing...

261
00:20:28.777 --> 00:20:30.747
Make sure none of it
bothers me.

262
00:20:31.787 --> 00:20:33.787
You have to do a good job,
okay?

263
00:21:11.257 --> 00:21:12.287
Doc.

264
00:21:17.098 --> 00:21:18.128
Hey, Doc.

265
00:21:18.628 --> 00:21:20.568
- Yes, Patient?
- Give me sleeping pills.

266
00:21:20.868 --> 00:21:21.868
Declined.

267
00:21:21.868 --> 00:21:24.438
If you get consultation,
I will prescribe you.

268
00:21:24.467 --> 00:21:25.668
I have insomnia.

269
00:21:25.668 --> 00:21:27.078
No, it's depression.

270
00:21:27.078 --> 00:21:29.037
All celebrities have it.

271
00:21:29.037 --> 00:21:32.148
We're always shooting late
and acting new characters.

272
00:21:32.148 --> 00:21:34.247
We're so stressed from
being exposed...

273
00:21:34.247 --> 00:21:35.547
- to the public.
- Patient.

274
00:21:35.747 --> 00:21:36.947
Do you cry these days?

275
00:21:39.217 --> 00:21:40.557
How many times
have I told you?

276
00:21:41.017 --> 00:21:43.787
Whether you cry
because you're happy,

277
00:21:43.787 --> 00:21:45.957
sad, or frustrated, I will
only prescribe you...

278
00:21:46.088 --> 00:21:47.697
the pills when you cry.

279
00:21:48.098 --> 00:21:51.098
You're always putting on
a fake smile.

280
00:21:51.628 --> 00:21:52.938
This is my last warning.

281
00:21:53.368 --> 00:21:55.598
No treatment,
no prescriptions.

282
00:21:56.237 --> 00:21:58.007
I mean it.

283
00:23:05.438 --> 00:23:07.707
Is this JH Entertainment?

284
00:23:07.908 --> 00:23:10.848
I'm a radio writer
named Song Geu Rim.

285
00:23:11.047 --> 00:23:13.477
I contacted you in regards
to casting Ji Soo Ho.

286
00:23:13.918 --> 00:23:16.947
I want to meet with
the CEO for the request.

287
00:23:16.947 --> 00:23:18.648
She's in a meeting
right now.

288
00:23:19.017 --> 00:23:21.217
When will she finish
her meeting?

289
00:23:21.517 --> 00:23:23.888
I'm afraid I cannot
tell you. Goodbye.

290
00:23:23.957 --> 00:23:25.388
Wait. I...

291
00:23:28.658 --> 00:23:30.628
Why can't she tell me?

292
00:23:50.818 --> 00:23:54.017
Hello, I'm Song Geu Rim.
I called you earlier.

293
00:23:54.188 --> 00:23:56.257
Could I meet with the CEO?

294
00:23:56.287 --> 00:23:58.188
Or maybe
Ji Soo Ho's manager...

295
00:23:58.188 --> 00:23:59.457
You need an appointment.

296
00:23:59.598 --> 00:24:03.098
Don't be like that.
I'm really a radio writer.

297
00:24:03.197 --> 00:24:05.098
Have you heard
of Mi Nu's Happy 6pm?

298
00:24:05.098 --> 00:24:06.838
You still need to make
an appointment.

299
00:24:12.108 --> 00:24:14.178
How can I meet them...

300
00:24:14.178 --> 00:24:16.178
if they won't let me
set up a meeting?

301
00:24:19.408 --> 00:24:22.818
I'll just wait over there
until Ms. Nam has time.

302
00:24:23.118 --> 00:24:24.318
Is that okay?

303
00:24:46.878 --> 00:24:48.878
I'll hear you out
on the way.

304
00:24:51.007 --> 00:24:52.747
Well, the thing is...

305
00:24:52.747 --> 00:24:55.148
You came yet again today,

306
00:24:55.447 --> 00:24:56.547
to cast me.

307
00:24:56.648 --> 00:24:58.118
I'll hear you out,
so talk.

308
00:24:58.118 --> 00:24:59.888
Be patient, Geu Rim.

309
00:24:59.888 --> 00:25:01.487
Just this once.

310
00:25:02.957 --> 00:25:03.957
Okay.

311
00:25:04.128 --> 00:25:06.828
Then why don't we go
to a cafe and talk...

312
00:25:06.828 --> 00:25:08.457
No, I don't have time.

313
00:25:08.457 --> 00:25:10.797
I'll listen during
the 30-minute ride home.

314
00:25:12.668 --> 00:25:14.398
Sure, sure.

315
00:25:14.398 --> 00:25:17.507
I'll drive you safely
to your house.

316
00:25:17.507 --> 00:25:19.207
I have a commercial
driver's license.

317
00:25:19.207 --> 00:25:21.338
I've been picking up
and dropping off...

318
00:25:21.338 --> 00:25:23.348
our DJs and guests...

319
00:25:23.348 --> 00:25:25.648
and am a seasoned driver
thanks to that.

320
00:25:25.648 --> 00:25:27.418
You can trust me.

321
00:25:35.257 --> 00:25:36.928
Excuse me.

322
00:25:37.328 --> 00:25:40.057
Here. Would you please
take a look?

323
00:25:41.527 --> 00:25:43.098
I made this
to introduce...

324
00:25:43.098 --> 00:25:45.098
- the radio...
- So?

325
00:25:45.098 --> 00:25:46.898
What was
your biggest show?

326
00:25:48.098 --> 00:25:50.507
- Nothing yet.
- Did you win any awards?

327
00:25:51.638 --> 00:25:52.638
None.

328
00:25:52.638 --> 00:25:54.938
Where can I see your work?

329
00:25:56.247 --> 00:25:58.047
Well...

330
00:25:58.307 --> 00:26:00.818
If you agree to be
our DJ,

331
00:26:00.818 --> 00:26:03.047
it'll be my first time
being the main writer.

332
00:26:03.047 --> 00:26:05.547
Does the radio pay more?

333
00:26:05.688 --> 00:26:07.957
- Does it make the news?
- Sorry?

334
00:26:07.957 --> 00:26:09.888
Name one benefit it has...

335
00:26:09.888 --> 00:26:11.257
over being on camera.

336
00:26:12.628 --> 00:26:15.457
Do you know how much I get
per episode of a drama?

337
00:26:15.557 --> 00:26:17.267
Do you know how much
it calculates to...

338
00:26:17.267 --> 00:26:18.497
in an entire year?

339
00:26:37.588 --> 00:26:38.848
Thank you.

340
00:26:55.697 --> 00:26:56.908
You have nothing else
to say, right?

341
00:26:56.967 --> 00:26:58.237
I gave you
plenty of opportunities,

342
00:26:58.237 --> 00:27:00.378
but you couldn't
convince me.

343
00:27:02.908 --> 00:27:06.047
Two Best Actor awards
at the Cheongryong Awards.

344
00:27:06.648 --> 00:27:09.547
You won an acting award
for your drama too.

345
00:27:09.818 --> 00:27:12.888
You're in every other
commercial on TV.

346
00:27:13.057 --> 00:27:15.757
You sell cell phones
over and over,

347
00:27:15.757 --> 00:27:17.257
and even beer.

348
00:27:17.557 --> 00:27:21.257
That's why I took notes
on your career,

349
00:27:21.257 --> 00:27:23.497
and you're going down
the wrong path.

350
00:27:24.197 --> 00:27:25.898
- So?
- So,

351
00:27:26.128 --> 00:27:28.368
the radio is the answer.

352
00:27:28.368 --> 00:27:29.737
Take off that fancy mask,

353
00:27:29.737 --> 00:27:32.068
and show them
who you really are.

354
00:27:32.267 --> 00:27:34.938
This is the time for you
to start a new chapter...

355
00:27:34.938 --> 00:27:36.977
in your life.
I firmly believe that.

356
00:27:37.348 --> 00:27:38.648
Soo Ho.

357
00:27:39.307 --> 00:27:42.477
You've been surrounded by
cameras for 15 years.

358
00:27:43.388 --> 00:27:45.717
There are no cameras
in radio.

359
00:27:47.118 --> 00:27:48.717
That's why it won't pay
or make the news...

360
00:27:48.717 --> 00:27:50.328
as much as TV.

361
00:27:50.328 --> 00:27:52.828
There are no flashes
going off in the booth.

362
00:27:52.828 --> 00:27:54.828
There's no set script
either.

363
00:27:56.428 --> 00:27:58.027
But Soo Ho.

364
00:27:59.997 --> 00:28:02.668
That's why this will be
very good for you.

365
00:28:04.408 --> 00:28:06.108
That's why...

366
00:28:06.108 --> 00:28:08.777
I really want to introduce
the radio to you.

367
00:28:14.418 --> 00:28:15.477
Give me the car keys.

368
00:28:15.477 --> 00:28:16.818
Yes. Here.

369
00:28:18.047 --> 00:28:19.047
Goodbye.

370
00:28:24.027 --> 00:28:25.487
Just a minute.

371
00:28:26.158 --> 00:28:28.557
Please look through this
just once.

372
00:28:28.557 --> 00:28:30.328
Just five minutes.

373
00:28:30.328 --> 00:28:31.527
Watch this
for five minutes,

374
00:28:31.527 --> 00:28:33.868
and listen to the radio
for 50 minutes.

375
00:28:34.237 --> 00:28:36.908
Please seriously think it
over for five days.

376
00:28:36.908 --> 00:28:37.908
Please?

377
00:28:39.267 --> 00:28:40.507
Ms. Song Geu Rim.

378
00:28:40.737 --> 00:28:41.777
Yes?

379
00:28:42.707 --> 00:28:44.378
How long have you been
in this industry?

380
00:28:44.378 --> 00:28:46.378
- How do you not know?
- Sorry?

381
00:28:46.378 --> 00:28:48.977
I said I'd never go on
the stupid radio,

382
00:28:48.977 --> 00:28:50.987
and to please
not show up...

383
00:28:50.987 --> 00:28:53.118
at shoots, my agency,
or anywhere.

384
00:28:55.017 --> 00:28:57.987
I was trying to say it
nicely out of kindness.

385
00:28:58.027 --> 00:29:00.297
Do you not get it when
spoken to nicely?

386
00:29:02.398 --> 00:29:03.727
On top of that,

387
00:29:03.727 --> 00:29:05.928
why do you make me
say it like this?

388
00:29:07.368 --> 00:29:09.037
I'll say it one more time.

389
00:29:09.138 --> 00:29:10.807
Stop getting up
in my face.

390
00:29:10.807 --> 00:29:12.838
Stop showing up. Please.

391
00:29:14.277 --> 00:29:15.908
I'll never go on
the stupid radio.

392
00:29:23.747 --> 00:29:25.348
Excuse me, Soo Ho.

393
00:29:27.888 --> 00:29:29.118
"The stupid radio"?

394
00:29:29.118 --> 00:29:31.027
What's
"the stupid radio"?

395
00:29:31.957 --> 00:29:35.257
Why are you putting
"stupid" before "radio"?

396
00:29:36.568 --> 00:29:37.828
Have you ever...

397
00:29:37.828 --> 00:29:40.297
once stepped foot
inside a radio booth?

398
00:29:40.297 --> 00:29:43.467
Have you ever properly
listened to the radio?

399
00:29:43.868 --> 00:29:45.267
From now on,

400
00:29:45.267 --> 00:29:47.638
I'll teach you
what radio really is...

401
00:29:47.638 --> 00:29:50.648
so that you can never
say something like that.

402
00:29:50.648 --> 00:29:52.947
You'll see how
it'll change your life.

403
00:29:53.318 --> 00:29:55.217
I won't show up and be
up in your face anymore.

404
00:29:55.217 --> 00:29:57.388
I'll always be next to you
and now "show up".

405
00:29:57.388 --> 00:29:58.947
Do you understand?

406
00:30:00.858 --> 00:30:01.957
So,

407
00:30:03.128 --> 00:30:06.297
I'll have to keep
following you around.

408
00:30:15.168 --> 00:30:16.767
Okay then.

409
00:30:16.967 --> 00:30:20.378
I'll see you tomorrow
and every day thereafter.

410
00:30:26.348 --> 00:30:28.848
How dare you disrespect
the radio?

411
00:30:29.818 --> 00:30:31.487
You can disrespect me,

412
00:30:31.487 --> 00:30:33.757
but you can't disrespect
the radio.

414
00:31:07.957 --> 00:31:10.227
Ji Soo Ho, that jerk.

415
00:31:11.328 --> 00:31:12.588
I mean,

416
00:31:13.098 --> 00:31:15.658
how could he disrespect
the radio like that?

417
00:31:16.027 --> 00:31:18.598
That's not right, is it?

418
00:31:19.838 --> 00:31:22.967
Was Ji Soo Ho
that big a jerk?

419
00:31:23.467 --> 00:31:27.537
Well, it's not like
he was a big jerk...

420
00:31:27.838 --> 00:31:31.348
I'm sure this brat
went off at him.

421
00:31:31.507 --> 00:31:33.148
It's so obvious.

422
00:31:33.418 --> 00:31:34.578
Of course.

423
00:31:34.678 --> 00:31:36.648
What now?

424
00:31:36.818 --> 00:31:40.818
Did you really think
you could win him over?

425
00:31:41.118 --> 00:31:42.888
- Really?
- No way.

426
00:31:42.987 --> 00:31:44.987
Well, I thought...

427
00:31:45.388 --> 00:31:47.057
if I was sincere,

428
00:31:47.057 --> 00:31:49.257
he'd appreciate
that sincerity.

429
00:31:49.257 --> 00:31:50.727
It was a beautiful
thought.

430
00:31:50.727 --> 00:31:51.797
Sincerity?

431
00:31:52.428 --> 00:31:53.967
Geu Rim, I think...

432
00:31:53.967 --> 00:31:54.967
you should...

433
00:31:54.967 --> 00:31:57.338
give up and call Ms. La.

434
00:31:57.338 --> 00:31:58.668
Ask her to make you
assistant writer...

435
00:31:58.668 --> 00:32:00.178
for her next show.

436
00:32:00.307 --> 00:32:01.608
But...

437
00:32:01.838 --> 00:32:03.348
I can't back off...

438
00:32:03.348 --> 00:32:05.678
after being treated
like that.

439
00:32:07.747 --> 00:32:09.047
Ji Soo Ho.

Patient. Come eat.

442
00:32:31.507 --> 00:32:32.507
Give it back.

00:32:40.477 --> 00:32:42.247
Come on.

445
00:32:43.987 --> 00:32:45.388
You couldn't sleep
last night...

446
00:32:45.388 --> 00:32:47.957
and stayed up, didn't you,
my depression patient?

447
00:32:47.957 --> 00:32:50.158
I prepared foods
that help you sleep.

448
00:32:50.158 --> 00:32:51.828
Just give me
sleeping pills.

449
00:32:51.828 --> 00:32:53.158
No.

450
00:32:53.158 --> 00:32:55.957
I'm looking for a cure
other than meds.

451
00:32:57.197 --> 00:32:58.197
Doc.

452
00:32:58.398 --> 00:32:59.398
If I stay up all night
again...

453
00:32:59.398 --> 00:33:00.838
because you won't
give me meds,

454
00:33:00.838 --> 00:33:02.197
what do I do at the shoot
tomorrow?

455
00:33:02.197 --> 00:33:03.608
That would be great.

456
00:33:03.608 --> 00:33:06.007
I'd love to see you
get sleepy.

457
00:33:06.007 --> 00:33:07.908
So? What must I do
to continue acting...

458
00:33:07.908 --> 00:33:09.807
without taking meds?

459
00:33:09.807 --> 00:33:11.547
Well, first,

460
00:33:12.348 --> 00:33:13.818
eat this. And...

461
00:33:15.418 --> 00:33:16.747
tell me how you feel.

462
00:33:20.188 --> 00:33:22.418
Let's get past stage one
of your treatment.

463
00:33:22.457 --> 00:33:23.588
How I feel?

464
00:33:25.588 --> 00:33:27.328
You said you knew
without my saying it.

465
00:33:27.328 --> 00:33:28.527
That's why
I called you here,

466
00:33:28.527 --> 00:33:30.128
paying five times
your salary.

467
00:33:30.128 --> 00:33:31.797
I was pulling your leg.

468
00:33:31.797 --> 00:33:33.168
How could I know
if you don't tell me?

469
00:33:33.168 --> 00:33:35.168
I'm not your creator.

470
00:33:39.068 --> 00:33:40.908
Hey, I spent a lot of time
cooking this.

471
00:33:44.207 --> 00:33:46.977
Darn it. I failed again.
Again.

472
00:33:46.977 --> 00:33:47.977
Darn it.

473
00:33:48.678 --> 00:33:49.688
It's so salty.

474
00:33:51.017 --> 00:33:53.557
So why did you call...

475
00:33:53.557 --> 00:33:56.118
seven times?

476
00:33:56.858 --> 00:33:58.287
Why didn't you answer,

477
00:33:58.287 --> 00:34:00.658
when you knew I called
seven times?

478
00:34:02.197 --> 00:34:04.428
That's why I came.

479
00:34:06.737 --> 00:34:07.737
But...

480
00:34:07.997 --> 00:34:09.608
you've aged.

481
00:34:09.938 --> 00:34:12.237
The make-up
doesn't suit your age.

482
00:34:13.977 --> 00:34:15.508
That's none of
your business.

483
00:34:17.548 --> 00:34:20.117
Does your stylist
actually do her job?

484
00:34:21.117 --> 00:34:23.048
I won't complain about
you fooling around...

485
00:34:23.048 --> 00:34:25.048
with actresses, but please
stay away from staff.

486
00:34:25.048 --> 00:34:27.688
So what put you
in a bad mood again,

487
00:34:27.688 --> 00:34:30.028
that you called me here?

488
00:34:30.387 --> 00:34:31.488
Your son.

489
00:34:32.427 --> 00:34:33.898
Do you know he's weird?

490
00:34:34.798 --> 00:34:36.668
It would be weird
if he wasn't weird.

491
00:34:36.668 --> 00:34:38.727
I'm not joking around.

492
00:34:38.727 --> 00:34:40.037
This is business.

493
00:34:41.597 --> 00:34:43.867
We need to stop it
before he gets weirder.

494
00:34:45.068 --> 00:34:46.838
If you want to continue...

495
00:34:47.108 --> 00:34:48.738
living as you do now.

496
00:34:49.108 --> 00:34:50.907
I'm sure you know
what I mean.

497
00:34:56.617 --> 00:34:58.188
Move back in for a bit.

498
00:34:59.387 --> 00:35:01.787
You can bring your young
lover if you want.

499
00:35:24.548 --> 00:35:26.347
Get out. I have work.

500
00:35:26.347 --> 00:35:29.318
No. Why do you go alone
without your manager?

501
00:35:29.448 --> 00:35:31.847
I said to get out.
I have a shoot.

502
00:35:32.718 --> 00:35:34.057
I'm going there too.

503
00:35:34.057 --> 00:35:37.057
- What?
- I said I'd follow you...

504
00:35:37.057 --> 00:35:39.427
24 hours a day. Let's go.

505
00:35:40.657 --> 00:35:42.097
Let's go.

506
00:35:49.838 --> 00:35:50.968
So,

507
00:35:51.537 --> 00:35:54.508
I'll have to keep
following you around.

508
00:35:55.608 --> 00:35:57.207
Okay, then.

509
00:35:57.407 --> 00:36:00.677
I'll see you tomorrow
and every day thereafter.

510
00:36:06.488 --> 00:36:08.188
I heard the last shoot
was incredible.

511
00:36:08.258 --> 00:36:10.858
Why does that always
happen when I'm not here?

512
00:36:11.488 --> 00:36:13.298
But who was that girl?

513
00:36:13.457 --> 00:36:15.957
I heard she was a writer.
Did you agree to go on?

514
00:36:17.128 --> 00:36:19.938
Do it for her.
Don't you feel bad?

515
00:36:19.938 --> 00:36:22.907
She's a writer, after all.
The word's out.

516
00:36:23.637 --> 00:36:24.738
What word?

517
00:36:25.068 --> 00:36:27.278
Song Geu Rim.
Lady Kamikaze.

518
00:36:27.677 --> 00:36:30.307
The writer who will do
anything to cast you.

519
00:36:31.278 --> 00:36:32.407
Who said that?

520
00:36:32.407 --> 00:36:34.577
That's what the entire
crew is saying today.

521
00:36:36.148 --> 00:36:38.617
I feel bad for the girl.

522
00:36:38.818 --> 00:36:41.017
I would've agreed right
away if she asked me.

523
00:36:42.858 --> 00:36:44.887
We should call out
Lady Kamikaze tonight.

524
00:36:45.157 --> 00:36:47.628
Let's see if she'll throw
herself into alcohol too.

525
00:36:52.227 --> 00:36:53.938
Stop getting up
in my face.

526
00:36:53.938 --> 00:36:55.838
Stop showing up. Please.

527
00:36:55.968 --> 00:36:57.468
I'll never go on
the stupid radio.

528
00:37:01.438 --> 00:37:02.608
Mom.

529
00:37:02.977 --> 00:37:05.048
- Do you know Ji Soo Ho?
- Ji Soo Ho?

530
00:37:05.548 --> 00:37:06.718
Who's that?

531
00:37:06.718 --> 00:37:08.218
See?

532
00:37:08.448 --> 00:37:11.617
He isn't that famous.
Why is he such a jerk?

533
00:37:11.988 --> 00:37:13.588
He's not even
a famous star.

534
00:37:13.588 --> 00:37:15.758
Why? What is it?

535
00:37:19.258 --> 00:37:22.258
Mom. It's always
three strikes, right?

536
00:37:22.258 --> 00:37:25.968
That's right. You should
always try three times.

537
00:37:26.298 --> 00:37:28.568
You can't quit
after trying only once.

538
00:37:28.568 --> 00:37:31.008
I didn't raise my daughter
to be like that.

539
00:37:32.807 --> 00:37:36.378
What if I don't succeed
after three strikes?

540
00:37:36.448 --> 00:37:39.378
Then you change
your principle.

541
00:37:39.778 --> 00:37:40.818
To what?

542
00:37:40.818 --> 00:37:43.188
"There are nine innings
in a game."

543
00:37:43.718 --> 00:37:46.617
What if I fail
even after nine tries?

544
00:37:48.057 --> 00:37:49.387
Then...

545
00:37:50.057 --> 00:37:52.927
"If at first you don't
succeed, try, try again."

546
00:37:53.258 --> 00:37:56.798
You should try again
with a long-term plan.

547
00:37:57.028 --> 00:37:59.427
- Right?
- Right.

548
00:38:00.698 --> 00:38:03.338
Mom. Whose daughter am I?

549
00:38:03.508 --> 00:38:07.177
This is how well
I was taught at home.

550
00:38:07.177 --> 00:38:08.838
That goes without saying.

551
00:38:09.108 --> 00:38:11.508
Then I'll eat well...

552
00:38:11.508 --> 00:38:13.117
and go for
my three strikes.

553
00:38:13.117 --> 00:38:14.648
Okay. Good luck.

554
00:38:14.778 --> 00:38:15.977
You can do it.

555
00:38:19.418 --> 00:38:21.718
I agree with
what you're saying,

556
00:38:21.718 --> 00:38:23.827
but I think we can get
a better shot.

557
00:38:24.227 --> 00:38:28.028
What we have is plenty
perfect already.

558
00:38:28.198 --> 00:38:30.668
We took seven takes.
Why do you want more?

559
00:38:30.867 --> 00:38:33.398
Look how sweet that is.

560
00:38:34.068 --> 00:38:36.938
Let's invite Lady Kamikaze
to our after party.

561
00:38:37.037 --> 00:38:38.037
She's cool.

562
00:38:38.037 --> 00:38:40.278
Let's see if she throws
herself into alcohol too.

563
00:38:41.077 --> 00:38:43.378
I've been bored lately.
That should be fun.

564
00:38:43.608 --> 00:38:46.617
- Who has her number?
- I do. I'll call her.

565
00:38:46.617 --> 00:38:49.117
Okay. Good. Nice.

566
00:38:49.747 --> 00:38:52.887
You'd better be prepared.
We'll drink for real.

567
00:38:53.787 --> 00:38:55.117
That should be fun.

568
00:38:55.488 --> 00:38:56.858
Hello, Mr. Jo.

569
00:38:57.258 --> 00:38:59.858
Are you positive Ji Soo Ho
will be there tonight?

570
00:38:59.957 --> 00:39:02.597
Yes, he may come.
Just come.

571
00:39:02.597 --> 00:39:04.698
You have a Lady Kamikaze
fan club here.

572
00:39:05.267 --> 00:39:06.537
Okay.

573
00:39:06.537 --> 00:39:09.398
Text me the address.
Thanks.

574
00:39:10.907 --> 00:39:12.037
Yes.

575
00:39:14.577 --> 00:39:15.778
Okay.

576
00:39:16.847 --> 00:39:17.878
There.

577
00:39:20.048 --> 00:39:22.648
- Thank you.
- You were great.

578
00:39:23.017 --> 00:39:24.218
- Thank you.
- Okay.

579
00:39:24.287 --> 00:39:26.488
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

580
00:39:30.927 --> 00:39:32.528
Who are you?

581
00:39:32.628 --> 00:39:34.227
Why did you
follow him here?

582
00:39:34.398 --> 00:39:36.198
Don't be so antagonistic.

583
00:39:36.927 --> 00:39:38.968
Let's formally
introduce ourselves.

584
00:39:39.068 --> 00:39:40.637
I'm Ji Soo Ho's manager.
And you are?

585
00:39:40.698 --> 00:39:43.037
I'm Ji Soo Ho's manager.

586
00:39:45.307 --> 00:39:46.778
Then I'll switch to...

587
00:39:46.977 --> 00:39:49.608
Soo Ho's high school
friend slash...

588
00:39:50.508 --> 00:39:53.778
someone with a secret
relationship with him.

589
00:39:56.448 --> 00:39:59.557
Come on.
Let's shake hands.

590
00:40:00.688 --> 00:40:01.718
Thank you.

591
00:40:01.818 --> 00:40:04.427
Are you really not coming
to the after party?

592
00:40:04.727 --> 00:40:07.398
I have plans tomorrow,
so I need to leave early.

593
00:40:08.157 --> 00:40:10.227
Come on, Soo Ho.
Go with us.

594
00:40:10.398 --> 00:40:12.367
That writer's coming too.

595
00:40:13.698 --> 00:40:15.938
Come on. Let's play
with Lady Kamikaze.

596
00:40:16.037 --> 00:40:18.508
You need to come
for her to have fun.

597
00:40:19.407 --> 00:40:20.707
Let's go.

598
00:40:42.968 --> 00:40:43.968
Here.

599
00:40:46.838 --> 00:40:48.338
Here. Drink.

600
00:40:48.338 --> 00:40:51.108
- Here's Lady Kamikaze.
- Hello. Hello.

601
00:40:51.108 --> 00:40:53.637
- You look so pretty.
- Hello.

602
00:40:54.008 --> 00:40:55.707
Hello, sir.

603
00:40:56.378 --> 00:40:58.548
You're looking good
as always.

604
00:40:59.108 --> 00:41:01.278
It's my stunt double.
Hi.

605
00:41:01.878 --> 00:41:03.418
Hello.

606
00:41:03.448 --> 00:41:05.588
I brought these for you,
Da Seul.

607
00:41:05.617 --> 00:41:07.617
You said you were
craving this before.

608
00:41:07.718 --> 00:41:09.827
I searched every
candy store in town.

609
00:41:09.827 --> 00:41:10.927
Wow, thanks...

610
00:41:11.588 --> 00:41:13.628
You're super cool,
Ms. Song.

611
00:41:13.628 --> 00:41:16.628
Of course.
I'm a very cool woman.

612
00:41:17.497 --> 00:41:19.898
So you must be
Lady Kamikaze.

613
00:41:20.367 --> 00:41:23.468
I heard you had it rough
because of Soo Ho.

614
00:41:24.508 --> 00:41:26.238
I didn't have it rough.

615
00:41:26.477 --> 00:41:28.838
It was crazy hard.

616
00:41:30.207 --> 00:41:31.847
I like you.

617
00:41:31.977 --> 00:41:33.677
Let me pour you a drink.

618
00:41:33.847 --> 00:41:36.448
By the way,
when is Ji Soo Ho coming?

619
00:41:36.448 --> 00:41:37.448
I'm not sure.

620
00:41:37.448 --> 00:41:39.957
He's the star, so he'll
probably come later.

621
00:41:43.227 --> 00:41:46.657
Are you really going to
drink such boring stuff?

622
00:41:47.457 --> 00:41:49.128
Who's Lady Kamikaze?

623
00:41:49.867 --> 00:41:52.867
Who is it, that ever since
you heard she was going...

624
00:41:52.867 --> 00:41:56.238
to the after party,
you won't talk at all?

625
00:41:59.367 --> 00:42:01.238
Who is Lady Kamikaze?

626
00:42:02.207 --> 00:42:04.177
Mr. Kim. Do you know?

627
00:42:08.648 --> 00:42:09.718
What the...

628
00:42:10.747 --> 00:42:12.117
This is so frustrating!

629
00:42:12.117 --> 00:42:15.157
This silence
is killing me!

630
00:42:15.758 --> 00:42:16.957
Darn it.

631
00:42:19.628 --> 00:42:21.827
(Song Geu Rim)

632
00:42:30.238 --> 00:42:33.307
- Kamikaze!
- Kamikaze!

633
00:42:33.307 --> 00:42:36.477
- Kamikaze!
- Kamikaze!

634
00:42:36.677 --> 00:42:38.347
- Kamikaze!
- Wait. Hold on.

635
00:42:38.747 --> 00:42:40.977
If I fill these
exactly to the brim...

636
00:42:40.977 --> 00:42:43.688
without overflowing,
every actor and actress...

637
00:42:43.747 --> 00:42:45.448
here today will come
on my show...

638
00:42:45.448 --> 00:42:48.287
as a guest at some point
when I ask, right?

639
00:42:48.887 --> 00:42:50.758
- Yes!
- Yes!

640
00:42:50.927 --> 00:42:52.427
Pinky swear?

641
00:42:53.497 --> 00:42:55.957
Okay. Here I go.

642
00:43:00.238 --> 00:43:01.968
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

643
00:43:01.968 --> 00:43:04.008
Bottoms up. Drink up.

644
00:43:05.508 --> 00:43:07.707
Drink. Drink. Nice.

645
00:43:11.577 --> 00:43:14.148
Ms. Song. Here.

646
00:43:14.477 --> 00:43:16.918
You're a good drinker.

647
00:43:16.988 --> 00:43:18.247
You know,

648
00:43:18.448 --> 00:43:21.617
I can usually drink
a lot more than this.

649
00:43:22.418 --> 00:43:23.927
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

650
00:43:24.088 --> 00:43:25.758
When is Ji Soo Ho coming?

651
00:43:26.698 --> 00:43:28.758
He said
he'll be here soon.

652
00:43:28.997 --> 00:43:32.198
Let's drink. Cheers.
Bottoms up.

653
00:43:34.997 --> 00:43:36.097
One more?

654
00:43:54.457 --> 00:43:56.057
Song Geu Rim.

655
00:43:57.057 --> 00:43:59.188
You're not this weak.

656
00:43:59.927 --> 00:44:01.727
You can't let alcohol
beat you...

657
00:44:01.727 --> 00:44:05.227
just because Ji Soo Ho
beat you.

658
00:44:05.827 --> 00:44:08.398
Hey. Of all things,

659
00:44:08.398 --> 00:44:12.407
soju bombs can't beat me.
That hurts my pride.

660
00:44:13.637 --> 00:44:15.338
Come on. Let's go.

661
00:45:00.858 --> 00:45:03.988
What is this
extremely strange place?

662
00:45:04.088 --> 00:45:05.827
What is this
bed-like thing...

663
00:45:05.827 --> 00:45:08.128
that I've seen only on TV?

664
00:45:11.198 --> 00:45:13.568
Yes. This is a dream.

665
00:45:14.068 --> 00:45:16.168
That's right.
It's a dream.

666
00:45:16.168 --> 00:45:19.037
I haven't had a dream
in so long.

667
00:45:34.287 --> 00:45:36.557
Ms. Song, do you want
to leave with me?

668
00:45:38.057 --> 00:45:39.057
Get up.

669
00:45:39.628 --> 00:45:42.457
Why did you drink
so much?

670
00:45:49.707 --> 00:45:50.707
My gosh.

671
00:45:51.767 --> 00:45:53.878
Hold on. Then...

672
00:45:54.207 --> 00:45:55.907
Get it together.

673
00:45:56.008 --> 00:45:57.207
Last night,

674
00:45:57.548 --> 00:45:59.977
Oh Jin Soo helped me up,

675
00:46:00.418 --> 00:46:01.477
and we walked...

676
00:46:02.617 --> 00:46:05.318
and then someone
showed up in front of me.

677
00:46:07.488 --> 00:46:08.488
Gosh!

678
00:46:09.218 --> 00:46:10.358
What the...

679
00:46:10.628 --> 00:46:12.227
Keep it down.

680
00:46:18.668 --> 00:46:21.198
What's going on here?

681
00:46:21.597 --> 00:46:23.807
What happened?

682
00:46:24.838 --> 00:46:27.177
I remember up to
walking out...

683
00:46:27.177 --> 00:46:29.747
with Oh Jin Soo
helping me walk,

684
00:46:29.747 --> 00:46:31.778
but I don't remember
anything after that.

685
00:46:31.778 --> 00:46:33.378
Why am I here?

686
00:46:34.378 --> 00:46:35.847
What's going on?

687
00:46:35.847 --> 00:46:37.617
Why did I wake up here?

688
00:46:41.818 --> 00:46:44.128
Did you come late
to the after party?

689
00:46:44.128 --> 00:46:45.358
Are you coming in with me?

690
00:46:45.758 --> 00:46:47.128
- Sorry?
- I'm going to shower.

691
00:46:47.128 --> 00:46:48.628
Are you coming in with me?

692
00:46:56.338 --> 00:46:57.968
So,

693
00:46:57.968 --> 00:47:00.378
I got wasted last night...

694
00:47:00.838 --> 00:47:02.537
and passed out
in the hallway.

695
00:47:02.778 --> 00:47:05.108
Oh Jin Soo
helped me up...

696
00:47:05.108 --> 00:47:07.718
and was trying
to take me home, but...

697
00:47:08.148 --> 00:47:09.247
I mean,

698
00:47:09.988 --> 00:47:12.887
why did I wake up here?

699
00:47:16.887 --> 00:47:18.358
Soo Ho.

700
00:47:18.358 --> 00:47:20.597
Why am I here?

701
00:47:20.597 --> 00:47:22.968
Please come out already.

702
00:47:31.307 --> 00:47:32.307
Look.

703
00:47:32.907 --> 00:47:35.738
You should at least
put on some clothes...

704
00:47:36.108 --> 00:47:37.477
You said to come out.

705
00:47:38.008 --> 00:47:39.278
Still.

706
00:47:39.677 --> 00:47:42.218
You should dry yourself
first.

707
00:47:43.017 --> 00:47:44.048
Do you want
to take a shower?

708
00:47:44.847 --> 00:47:45.847
Sorry?

709
00:47:46.887 --> 00:47:47.918
Look.

710
00:47:51.387 --> 00:47:52.588
Oh, no.

711
00:47:53.557 --> 00:47:54.698
What...

712
00:48:10.278 --> 00:48:11.677
If you won't shower,
get changed.

713
00:48:11.677 --> 00:48:12.918
I'll take you home.

714
00:48:14.677 --> 00:48:16.648
Just what happened last...

715
00:48:28.997 --> 00:48:30.097
Ms. Song.

716
00:48:31.867 --> 00:48:33.168
Should I do
the radio show?

717
00:48:35.068 --> 00:48:36.068
Sorry?

718
00:48:36.307 --> 00:48:38.168
Then do something for me.

719
00:48:50.918 --> 00:48:52.188
Your father okayed it.

720
00:48:52.188 --> 00:48:54.557
You'll shoot a movie
starting next month.

721
00:48:54.818 --> 00:48:56.588
I have some things
to discuss with you...

722
00:48:56.588 --> 00:48:57.887
and notify you.

723
00:48:57.887 --> 00:49:00.327
So you'll have to move
home for a while.

724
00:49:01.528 --> 00:49:02.968
It's cold.
Let's talk inside.

725
00:49:03.398 --> 00:49:05.568
I'm sure
I smiled and said,

726
00:49:05.927 --> 00:49:07.497
"I won't do it."

727
00:49:09.238 --> 00:49:10.238
Sure.

728
00:49:10.568 --> 00:49:12.707
And I smiled and said
you will.

729
00:49:14.037 --> 00:49:15.177
Let's go inside.

730
00:49:15.738 --> 00:49:16.948
You talk about
staying mysterious...

731
00:49:16.948 --> 00:49:18.977
and ban me from doing
other activities,

732
00:49:18.977 --> 00:49:20.778
but I should do anything
that makes money.

733
00:49:21.247 --> 00:49:23.988
Will Father's lover also
be in that...

734
00:49:23.988 --> 00:49:25.787
real life
documentary movie?

735
00:49:28.488 --> 00:49:29.488
Ma'am.

736
00:49:30.088 --> 00:49:33.457
I'm thinking about
DJing a radio show.

737
00:49:34.628 --> 00:49:37.128
All I have are commercial
after commercial...

738
00:49:37.128 --> 00:49:39.898
and that real life
documentary movie.

739
00:49:39.898 --> 00:49:42.468
I don't like a single
project coming up.

740
00:49:45.008 --> 00:49:48.207
I was meeting with
a radio writer actually.

741
00:50:10.468 --> 00:50:11.528
Explain.

742
00:50:13.537 --> 00:50:14.698
She's a radio writer.

743
00:50:15.338 --> 00:50:17.867
I need some supplemental
explanations.

744
00:50:18.707 --> 00:50:20.207
I'm going to sign
a contract.

745
00:50:20.907 --> 00:50:24.247
That's why I can't do that
real whatever movie...

746
00:50:24.407 --> 00:50:25.577
that you mentioned.

747
00:50:26.918 --> 00:50:27.948
How long?

748
00:50:28.847 --> 00:50:30.988
How long will you play
doing radio,

749
00:50:30.988 --> 00:50:33.017
and how long will you play
with that girl?

750
00:50:37.528 --> 00:50:38.528
Who knows?

751
00:50:42.758 --> 00:50:44.168
You're good
at casting celebrities.

752
00:50:45.398 --> 00:50:47.838
Although I don't know
which skill it was.

753
00:51:13.198 --> 00:51:14.298
Excuse me.

754
00:51:16.157 --> 00:51:17.227
"Play"?

755
00:51:18.528 --> 00:51:20.898
What did your mother
just say...

756
00:51:20.898 --> 00:51:21.968
Let's go.

757
00:51:23.508 --> 00:51:24.738
Let's talk later.

758
00:51:32.847 --> 00:51:36.218
Excuse me. What did you
just say to your mother?

759
00:51:37.188 --> 00:51:39.088
And what
did your mother...

760
00:51:39.088 --> 00:51:41.117
just say before she left?

761
00:51:41.318 --> 00:51:44.128
I can't understand,
so please explain.

762
00:51:46.398 --> 00:51:47.727
Don't you want me
to do the show?

763
00:51:47.727 --> 00:51:50.227
What other explanation
do you need?

764
00:51:51.427 --> 00:51:53.668
If you don't want
to do it, just leave.

765
00:51:53.738 --> 00:51:55.568
Don't do it
if I don't want to?

766
00:51:55.798 --> 00:51:57.907
Are you threatening me?

767
00:51:58.137 --> 00:52:00.207
No. How is this a threat?

768
00:52:00.608 --> 00:52:02.338
Soo Ho. In your fight...

769
00:52:02.338 --> 00:52:05.577
for power with your
mother, CEO, or whatever,

770
00:52:05.577 --> 00:52:07.718
you made me
look like an easy woman,

771
00:52:07.918 --> 00:52:10.617
and used my show
to threaten me.

772
00:52:11.787 --> 00:52:13.258
Then don't do it.

773
00:52:13.318 --> 00:52:15.218
Turn me down.
It's not a loss to me.

774
00:52:17.927 --> 00:52:19.157
Seriously...

775
00:52:19.157 --> 00:52:20.528
If it sounds like
a threat,

776
00:52:20.528 --> 00:52:22.628
I won't do it.
Problem solved.

777
00:52:22.698 --> 00:52:24.227
Plus, this is not
a threat.

778
00:52:24.227 --> 00:52:26.028
I'm being sincere.

779
00:52:28.838 --> 00:52:30.668
Can't you please leave?

780
00:52:33.707 --> 00:52:34.878
Soo Ho.

781
00:52:36.137 --> 00:52:38.207
Why do you keep smiling?

782
00:52:40.077 --> 00:52:41.278
Why are you smiling?

783
00:52:41.278 --> 00:52:42.988
This isn't funny.

784
00:52:43.588 --> 00:52:45.648
Why do you keep
fake-smiling at me?

785
00:52:45.648 --> 00:52:47.218
You're making me mad!

786
00:52:50.188 --> 00:52:51.758
Then I'll talk
without smiling.

787
00:52:53.157 --> 00:52:54.927
Leave. Please.

788
00:53:29.698 --> 00:53:31.727
Bravo.

789
00:53:31.898 --> 00:53:34.497
She must be Song Geu Rim,
the Lady Kamikaze.

790
00:53:34.997 --> 00:53:35.997
I wasn't eavesdropping.

791
00:53:35.997 --> 00:53:37.867
You guys were too loud.

792
00:53:39.137 --> 00:53:40.137
Patient.

793
00:53:41.278 --> 00:53:42.907
Do her radio show.

794
00:53:43.477 --> 00:53:45.207
Seeing you like this...

795
00:53:45.807 --> 00:53:47.418
makes me so happy.

796
00:53:49.617 --> 00:53:50.718
Stay still.

797
00:53:54.358 --> 00:53:55.858
Nice.

798
00:54:46.938 --> 00:54:49.577
(Mr. Moon Sung Woo,
my name is Song Geu Rim.)

799
00:55:07.597 --> 00:55:09.097
Hello, Soo Ho.

800
00:55:09.927 --> 00:55:12.898
I am Song Geu Rim,
a radio writer...

801
00:55:12.898 --> 00:55:15.037
who wants to write
the warmest words ever.

802
00:55:15.867 --> 00:55:19.338
I've prepared this video
to introduce to you,

803
00:55:19.577 --> 00:55:22.407
the radio, which I love...

804
00:55:22.407 --> 00:55:24.048
so very much.

805
00:55:25.608 --> 00:55:28.577
The postcards I sent in
when I was in...

806
00:55:28.577 --> 00:55:31.418
middle school and high
school are still up.

807
00:55:32.287 --> 00:55:35.758
I loved the radio and
listened every day.

808
00:55:37.588 --> 00:55:41.528
This booth belongs to
KBC Radio's legend,

809
00:55:41.528 --> 00:55:43.898
a DJ of 30 years.

810
00:55:47.168 --> 00:55:49.097
Yes. This is the office...

811
00:55:49.168 --> 00:55:51.508
where I write my scripts.

812
00:55:52.137 --> 00:55:54.707
It may look like
a storage room,

813
00:55:54.807 --> 00:55:56.448
but it is my writing room.

814
00:55:57.548 --> 00:55:59.747
And here.

815
00:56:00.218 --> 00:56:02.847
Do you see all the
scripts that I hope...

816
00:56:02.847 --> 00:56:04.148
you'd read?

817
00:56:04.287 --> 00:56:05.648
Will you please save them?

818
00:56:08.588 --> 00:56:11.657
This is the place
I love the most.

819
00:56:12.028 --> 00:56:14.028
My hideout.

820
00:56:18.898 --> 00:56:20.097
Soo Ho.

821
00:56:20.537 --> 00:56:22.798
I'm not a good writer,

822
00:56:23.168 --> 00:56:26.307
and I can't do anything
well right now.

823
00:56:27.238 --> 00:56:30.608
But if you say you'd do
the radio show with me,

824
00:56:30.977 --> 00:56:32.878
and the words
that I write...

825
00:56:33.077 --> 00:56:36.787
are read to the world
with your voice,

826
00:56:37.218 --> 00:56:40.057
I may bow down to you
that very day.

827
00:56:42.057 --> 00:56:43.528
Does that sound like
a threat?

828
00:56:44.528 --> 00:56:45.727
Anyway,

829
00:56:46.427 --> 00:56:48.698
I hope you will...

830
00:56:48.698 --> 00:56:51.727
knock on this door.

831
00:56:53.068 --> 00:56:55.168
Let's do the radio show
together.

832
00:58:28.528 --> 00:58:29.927
Hello, Mr. Kang.

833
00:58:30.028 --> 00:58:31.827
Get up here
right this instant.

834
00:58:45.247 --> 00:58:47.677
Song Geu Rim will be
your main writer?

835
00:58:48.577 --> 00:58:51.017
Hey, Crazy Gang.
Have you lost your mind?

836
00:58:52.918 --> 00:58:55.188
Song Geu Rim
is a problem too.

837
00:58:55.218 --> 00:58:57.387
Did she say she'll do it?

838
00:58:57.488 --> 00:59:00.457
Did she agree, saying
she'll be the main writer?

839
00:59:01.258 --> 00:59:03.528
Okay. Fine.

840
00:59:03.528 --> 00:59:06.938
You're working together
to drive me crazy, right?

841
00:59:08.097 --> 00:59:10.338
Geu Rim. Get over here.

842
00:59:11.807 --> 00:59:14.938
Are you really going to be
the main writer...

843
00:59:15.378 --> 00:59:17.008
as it says
in the proposal?

844
00:59:17.778 --> 00:59:20.747
Mr. Kang. You agreed that
I can staff...

845
00:59:20.747 --> 00:59:22.988
Crazy Gang. Don't talk.

846
00:59:24.117 --> 00:59:27.657
I'm trying to save
this radio station...

847
00:59:27.918 --> 00:59:30.887
and begged until my hands
bled to save you.

848
00:59:30.927 --> 00:59:34.057
Are you trying to say
we should die together?

849
00:59:34.997 --> 00:59:38.597
How could you
make her the main writer?

850
00:59:39.227 --> 00:59:42.267
She can't write
a single script properly.

851
00:59:42.267 --> 00:59:43.438
- What...
- Mr. Kang.

852
00:59:43.438 --> 00:59:46.307
You.
Don't say another word.

853
00:59:47.537 --> 00:59:48.778
You talk.

854
00:59:49.747 --> 00:59:52.577
Can you really be
the main writer?

855
00:59:54.247 --> 00:59:57.188
It says right here,
"Main writer,"

856
00:59:57.188 --> 00:59:59.048
"Song Geu Rim."

857
00:59:59.287 --> 01:00:02.758
Can you create a show
and write the script well?

858
01:00:03.157 --> 01:00:04.258
Can you?

859
01:00:08.957 --> 01:00:10.298
You now Ms. La, right?

860
01:00:12.798 --> 01:00:14.438
Work with her.

861
01:00:14.968 --> 01:00:18.108
If you really want to work
with Geu Rim,

862
01:00:18.267 --> 01:00:21.037
you can use her
as an assistant writer.

863
01:00:21.608 --> 01:00:23.747
Ms. La. Is that okay?

864
01:00:26.247 --> 01:00:27.948
She said, "Okay."

865
01:00:30.747 --> 01:00:32.347
I'll work with Geu Rim.

866
01:00:37.957 --> 01:00:39.927
Fine.

867
01:00:41.858 --> 01:00:44.367
As it says
in this proposal,

868
01:00:44.597 --> 01:00:46.597
if Ji Soo Ho agrees
to do it,

869
01:00:47.398 --> 01:00:49.707
you can be the main
writer. You have...

870
01:00:50.438 --> 01:00:51.707
my seal of approval.

871
01:00:52.008 --> 01:00:54.878
So? Did he agree to do it?

872
01:00:55.508 --> 01:00:58.948
Did you even get him
to agree?

873
01:00:59.407 --> 01:01:00.747
No, right?

874
01:01:00.847 --> 01:01:02.718
He refuses, right?

875
01:01:02.718 --> 01:01:06.517
Even without Ji Soo Ho,
I'm working with Geu Rim.

876
01:01:10.488 --> 01:01:12.787
Hey, Crazy Gang.
Where are you going?

877
01:01:13.497 --> 01:01:15.657
Forget coming back
to work!

878
01:01:15.657 --> 01:01:17.867
Forget the whole thing,
you punk!

879
01:01:18.568 --> 01:01:21.497
Sorry, Ms. La.
He'll change his mind.

880
01:01:21.968 --> 01:01:23.267
- It's okay.
- Be understanding.

881
01:01:35.948 --> 01:01:37.188
Geu Rim.

882
01:01:43.688 --> 01:01:45.157
Did you really think...

883
01:01:48.497 --> 01:01:50.497
if you got Ji Soo Ho
to join,

884
01:01:51.267 --> 01:01:53.637
you could be
the main writer?

885
01:01:56.307 --> 01:01:59.508
Wake up, will you,
Geu Rim?

886
01:02:00.207 --> 01:02:02.477
Even if you're good at
winning over guests...

887
01:02:02.477 --> 01:02:05.148
and at kissing up
to people,

888
01:02:06.077 --> 01:02:08.718
if you can't write,
you'll go on air...

889
01:02:08.718 --> 01:02:10.688
and humiliate yourself.

890
01:02:11.387 --> 01:02:14.088
You know your limitations,
don't you?

891
01:02:18.528 --> 01:02:20.858
I don't know how you got
Lee Gang to pick you...

892
01:02:20.858 --> 01:02:22.157
to be the main writer,

893
01:02:22.427 --> 01:02:25.097
but Ji Soo Ho...

894
01:02:25.698 --> 01:02:28.338
Do you really think
that's even possible?

895
01:02:29.838 --> 01:02:32.938
Is that why you're here?
You think it can happen?

896
01:02:33.378 --> 01:02:36.807
Like Ji Soo Ho would
really DJ a radio show.

897
01:02:37.648 --> 01:02:40.218
Geu Rim.
I'm saying this...

898
01:02:40.247 --> 01:02:42.948
because I'm concerned
for you. I mean it.

899
01:02:43.117 --> 01:02:45.048
Wake up
and smell the coffee!

900
01:02:45.188 --> 01:02:48.157
The probability of him
becoming a radio DJ...

901
01:02:48.157 --> 01:02:49.488
is much worse than you
becoming a main writer.

902
01:02:50.427 --> 01:02:51.457
Got that?

903
01:02:52.997 --> 01:02:54.597
I'll do the radio show.

904
01:02:57.497 --> 01:02:59.668
Let's do the radio show.

905
01:03:42.838 --> 01:03:44.307
(Radio Romance)

906
01:03:44.677 --> 01:03:45.807
Want to be my AD?

907
01:03:46.378 --> 01:03:47.778
Work with me.

908
01:03:47.948 --> 01:03:50.048
You really agreed?
Because of Lady Kamikaze?

909
01:03:50.048 --> 01:03:51.218
It wasn't
because of her.

910
01:03:51.218 --> 01:03:53.258
He wants to choose
the guests and his lines?

911
01:03:53.258 --> 01:03:54.418
How did you know?

912
01:03:54.418 --> 01:03:56.088
I heard we're battling.

913
01:03:56.088 --> 01:03:57.688
This is absurd.
A battle?

914
01:03:57.827 --> 01:04:00.997
I'll sign the contract
only with Song Geu Rim.

915
01:04:01.298 --> 01:04:02.497
Let me ask one thing.

916
01:04:02.497 --> 01:04:04.367
That's the best thing
I've heard. Ask 100.

917
01:04:04.767 --> 01:04:06.537
Why did I agree
to go on the radio?

918
01:04:06.597 --> 01:04:08.738
Will you not do it then?
