00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:06.480
(All the characters, organizations, places, and happenings...)

2
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.920
(in this drama are all fake and are not based on a true story.)

3
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:12.610
What is it that you want?

4
00:00:16.489 --> 00:00:17.520
It's obvious.

5
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.160
Your life.

6
00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.139
Wait!

7
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.470
That's...

8
00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:38.340
Wait. It was Officer Oh?

9
00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:43.010
I think he abducted...

10
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:45.450
Lee Kwang Ho.

11
00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:07.970
Did you get a good look?

12
00:01:09.599 --> 00:01:10.709
Who knows?

13
00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.509
You might really want to kill someone.

14
00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.509
In the end,

15
00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.149
he'll end up getting killed by his own son.

16
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.860
I heard you failed to do the press conference.

17
00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.199
(Episode 39)

18
00:01:34.199 --> 00:01:35.199
Yes, thanks to you.

19
00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.030
Why did you want to see me?

20
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.199
You must be really angry.

21
00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:41.869
You lost your chance in catching Manager Lee.

22
00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:43.209
It doesn't matter.

23
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.880
There's someone else who's going to catch him.

24
00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:48.479
I guess you already know that...

25
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.080
Kim Jong Sam took Manager Lee.

26
00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:54.220
The reason I asked you to meet was to tell you that.

27
00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.050
Are you quick with information?

28
00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.989
Or did you plan this with him?

29
00:01:58.989 --> 00:02:00.390
I'm just quick-witted.

30
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.729
Whatever the case, you should know that it spared your life.

31
00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.329
If this didn't happen, you'd be in big trouble right now.

32
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.970
Manager Lee was really angry,

33
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.000
so he had asked me to deal with you.

34
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.699
But of course, I stopped that from happening.

35
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.940
Please stop trying to take credit.

36
00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.340
You would've tried to kill me if it weren't for Kim Jong Sam.

37
00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.079
Plus, you would've actively taken part.

38
00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.519
Anyway, I wonder why he took Manager Lee.

39
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.250
To kill him?

40
00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:32.650
Maybe.

41
00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:34.819
That would be better for Manager Lee.

42
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.259
He'll be dying...

43
00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:39.660
before the press get a hold of his past wrongdoings.

44
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.799
He might be able to save his face,

45
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.669
but I'm sure he'll feel very miserable...

46
00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.340
due to the fact that he might get killed by Kim Jong Sam.

47
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:50.710
Why?

48
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.940
Because Kim Jong Sam used to be a death-row convict?

49
00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:02.949
You want my life?

50
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.419
Then kill me.

51
00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:08.919
You should do what you want to do.

52
00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:10.389
Of course.

53
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.199
But before that,

54
00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:15.960
there's something you need to do.

55
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.199
My mom...

56
00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:22.599
Why did you kill Choi Yeon Mi?

57
00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:24.870
Answer me.

58
00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:29.240
Must you hear the answer to know why?

59
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.880
She was my biggest mistake and obstacle.

60
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.319
I wouldn't have been able to succeed if she was around.

61
00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:40.419
That good-for-nothing success.

62
00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.329
You only got that from killing people.

63
00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:47.599
Do you know...

64
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.400
what my mom told me about you?

65
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.569
She said you were a warm-hearted man.

66
00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:08.549
"Father".

67
00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:12.349
He was a warm-hearted man.

68
00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:18.230
That's why I liked him a lot.

69
00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:24.100
She was on the run because she knew you were trying to kill her.

70
00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:28.199
But that's what she told me.

71
00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.310
How could you...

72
00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:38.149
kill someone like that?

73
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:39.750
That's why...

74
00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.389
she shouldn't have given birth to you.

75
00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:47.190
You shouldn't have been born.

76
00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:50.029
She should've listened when I told her not to have you!

77
00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:52.130
Then why didn't you kill me after I was born?

78
00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:55.029
Why did you make me get caught up in your life?

79
00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.670
Because I didn't know!

80
00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.639
Until you said your mother's name,

81
00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:06.110
I thought Mr. Cha had killed you.

82
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.719
Is that why you ordered Manager Kwak to kill me...

83
00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:17.920
because I was your son...

84
00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:21.659
that shouldn't have been alive?

85
00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:25.690
Answer me.

86
00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.600
Is that why you tried to kill Chul Gi?

87
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.639
Do you think he actually took him to kill him?

88
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.339
It's very possible.

89
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.209
Kwang Ho ordered Manager Kwak to kill him.

90
00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:45.209
And Detective Kang got hurt.

91
00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:49.620
Still, Officer Oh wouldn't do such a thing.

92
00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:52.120
Don't you think he's just trying to threaten him?

93
00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:53.990
Because Kwang Ho keeps getting away?

94
00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:56.089
He must've planned to kill Kwang Ho.

95
00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.829
Because Kwang Ho killed Officer Oh's mother...

96
00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.130
20 years ago.

97
00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:04.469
No way. Then is this really revenge?

98
00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:07.940
He's an officer. He should go by the law.

99
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.040
He probably thought the law wouldn't work.

100
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.509
Gook Su Ran tried to hold a press interview...

101
00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:15.839
this morning to reveal Lee Kwang Ho's crimes.

102
00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:19.149
But it didn't happen because she lost the proof to him.

103
00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:20.779
Is that what happened?

104
00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.949
You should've told me sooner.

105
00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:25.750
He probably thought there was no other way...

106
00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.319
since they wouldn't issue an arrest warrant.

107
00:06:31.459 --> 00:06:32.730
Yes, this is Jin Jin Young.

108
00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.060
Yes.

109
00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:39.600
So he entered the back road after passing Youngsun Junction...

110
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.100
and didn't come out.

111
00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.639
When was that?

112
00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.670
An hour ago?

113
00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.079
Please keep monitoring the roads.

114
00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:49.980
Call me when he's on the security camera again.

115
00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.980
How far is Youngsun Junction?

116
00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:54.420
At this speed, it'll take 20 minutes.

117
00:06:55.149 --> 00:06:56.490
Should we call the local police station?

118
00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:57.990
If he gets caught,

119
00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:00.089
he'll get arrested for abduction.

120
00:07:00.159 --> 00:07:02.259
It's better than becoming a murderer.

121
00:07:02.259 --> 00:07:05.990
Call the local police and tell them to start the search.

122
00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:08.360
Don't say who the victim and the suspect are.

123
00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.029
Lieutenant Jin, check the map...

124
00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:12.370
and see where they could be.

125
00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:14.100
- Okay. - Let's just hope...

126
00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.000
- that we arrive there first. - Okay.

127
00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:19.639
Please don't do anything, Officer Oh.

128
00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:24.980
So what were you trying so hard to protect?

129
00:07:27.519 --> 00:07:28.750
In order to become a president,

130
00:07:30.089 --> 00:07:31.250
you killed my mother,

131
00:07:32.589 --> 00:07:33.759
Jin Jung Gil,

132
00:07:34.889 --> 00:07:36.190
and Hong Mi Ok.

133
00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:38.089
And to protect 100 million dollars...

134
00:07:38.589 --> 00:07:41.699
you killed Oh Il Seung and Ddak Ji.

135
00:07:44.469 --> 00:07:46.339
You were going to kill me...

136
00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.240
because I was in your way.

137
00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:55.240
And to cover all that up,

138
00:07:56.449 --> 00:07:58.180
you are going to kill more people.

139
00:08:01.019 --> 00:08:03.149
What is it that you are trying to protect?

140
00:08:08.159 --> 00:08:09.589
Protecting it isn't enough.

141
00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:12.029
I should make it grow.

142
00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:14.230
Make it bigger.

143
00:08:15.159 --> 00:08:16.159
What exactly?

144
00:08:18.769 --> 00:08:19.800
Money?

145
00:08:20.899 --> 00:08:22.000
Power?

146
00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:26.880
You already have more than enough, don't you?

147
00:08:27.639 --> 00:08:29.279
Your money will last more than your lifetime.

148
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:32.509
Your power can cover up all your crimes.

149
00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:35.279
You have them all.

150
00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:40.159
Those things will be gone when you die.

151
00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:41.389
What are you trying to do with them?

152
00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:44.090
Tell me.

153
00:08:45.259 --> 00:08:48.429
What are you trying to do with that filthy money and power?

154
00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.769
Republic of Korea.

155
00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.139
I must have the country in my hands again,

156
00:08:58.139 --> 00:09:00.539
so this country could live!

157
00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:09.450
You're crazy.

158
00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.809
Yes. We'll cover this area.

159
00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:35.779
Please expand the search area. Thank you.

160
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:36.950
Hey.

161
00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:38.779
We can't find them this way.

162
00:09:38.809 --> 00:09:40.850
Things fell through while he was preparing...

163
00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:43.689
the press interview with Gook Su Ran.

164
00:09:43.689 --> 00:09:45.620
She must've told him a place she knows.

165
00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:47.360
Does that mean they're in this together?

166
00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:48.990
That's possible.

167
00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.929
Since Chairwoman Gook is dying to get Lee Kwang Ho.

168
00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:53.429
Call Assistant Manager Ki.

169
00:09:53.429 --> 00:09:55.330
He must know if Chairwoman Gook knows.

170
00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.970
I didn't think Assistant Manager Ki would come in handy.

171
00:10:01.799 --> 00:10:02.840
Who is this?

172
00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:07.380
Why are you asking me that?

173
00:10:07.439 --> 00:10:09.750
We saved you once before.

174
00:10:10.509 --> 00:10:12.580
Plus we're trying to catch Lee Kwang Ho.

175
00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:15.519
General Manager Kwak got locked up because of him.

176
00:10:16.649 --> 00:10:17.820
Are you telling me the truth?

177
00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:19.759
Are you really...

178
00:10:20.159 --> 00:10:22.620
going after Manager Lee?

179
00:10:23.659 --> 00:10:26.559
Don't you dare try to harm Chairwoman Gook.

180
00:10:29.769 --> 00:10:30.970
So where is the location?

181
00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:35.939
Youngsun Junction. That's...

182
00:10:36.509 --> 00:10:40.740
the place I told Il Seung earlier.

183
00:10:42.309 --> 00:10:45.450
Yes. The address is...

184
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:07.600
You fool.

185
00:11:11.309 --> 00:11:15.439
That's why you can never beat me.

186
00:11:16.279 --> 00:11:18.679
You must get rid of someone if he's a problem.

187
00:11:19.409 --> 00:11:20.649
If you leave let him live,

188
00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:23.350
you will lose your life.

189
00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:34.700
That's right.

190
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:38.529
That's why you killed them.

191
00:11:42.139 --> 00:11:43.269
Choi Yeon Mi,

192
00:11:44.639 --> 00:11:45.870
Jin Jung Gil,

193
00:11:46.909 --> 00:11:47.909
Hong Mi Ok...

194
00:11:48.139 --> 00:11:49.210
I did.

195
00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:51.750
And Oh Il Seung.

196
00:11:54.179 --> 00:11:55.450
Geum Byul too.

197
00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:57.049
I told you I killed them.

198
00:11:58.090 --> 00:11:59.149
If I hadn't...

199
00:12:00.519 --> 00:12:02.559
I wouldn't be where I am.

200
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:04.689
Look.

201
00:12:04.929 --> 00:12:06.630
You're the one who'll die in the end.

202
00:12:07.529 --> 00:12:09.159
Even if I'm your dad,

203
00:12:09.259 --> 00:12:11.970
you should've killed me if you set your mind to it.

204
00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:16.639
Don't flatter yourself.

205
00:12:19.039 --> 00:12:21.809
Do you think I didn't kill you because you're my father?

206
00:12:23.909 --> 00:12:26.620
I haven't known you enough to be bothered by it.

207
00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:30.350
I saved you...

208
00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:32.889
because I'm different.

209
00:12:35.189 --> 00:12:37.529
Because I'm different from you.

210
00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.559
This is your last chance.

211
00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:43.899
I won't let you die as a selfish scumbag.

212
00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:46.539
I'll let you live...

213
00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.669
to give you a chance to live like a human being.

214
00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:54.580
So...

215
00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:59.149
put that down and leave.

216
00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.320
Do you think your childish and sentimental comment...

217
00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.049
change my mind?

218
00:13:05.549 --> 00:13:07.889
I have never in my life...

219
00:13:07.919 --> 00:13:09.960
let go of a chance to win.

220
00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:13.330
It's the same now. I win in the end.

221
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.639
This way.

222
00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:27.710
I think this is it.

223
00:13:28.309 --> 00:13:30.409
- Officer Oh! - Officer Oh!

224
00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:37.250
Hey!

225
00:13:37.689 --> 00:13:38.720
Hey.

226
00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:45.360
Are you okay?

227
00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:49.460
We've been so worried.

228
00:13:52.399 --> 00:13:53.600
Are you all right?

229
00:13:54.269 --> 00:13:55.340
Yes.

230
00:13:55.799 --> 00:13:56.809
Where's Lee Kwang Ho?

231
00:13:57.809 --> 00:13:58.840
He left.

232
00:13:58.909 --> 00:14:00.779
He left? Where?

233
00:14:01.939 --> 00:14:02.980
He just...

234
00:14:04.509 --> 00:14:05.750
left.

235
00:14:10.374 --> 00:14:15.374
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E39 Doubtful Victory "Why Didn't You Kill Me?"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

236
00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:21.600
I'm the one who won.

237
00:14:23.799 --> 00:14:25.130
You...

238
00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:27.169
confessed everything.

239
00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:32.980
What can you do with that?

240
00:14:34.509 --> 00:14:36.179
You'll see...

241
00:14:37.279 --> 00:14:39.149
what I'll do with this.

242
00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:46.220
You can go now.

243
00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:57.700
Arrest him.

244
00:15:04.269 --> 00:15:05.309
Come on.

245
00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:16.850
What were you going to do?

246
00:15:18.519 --> 00:15:19.860
Why did you abduct him?

247
00:15:22.689 --> 00:15:24.289
I was really going to kill him.

248
00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:28.360
I wanted to hear the truth from him as well.

249
00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.630
I understand why you did such a thing,

250
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.870
but you can't let yourself become so reckless.

251
00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.740
I didn't seem to have any other choice.

252
00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:40.340
If I didn't do anything,

253
00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:45.279
it felt as if more people would end up getting hurt.

254
00:15:47.549 --> 00:15:48.649
But still,

255
00:15:49.789 --> 00:15:51.820
you should never try to murder him.

256
00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.460
I know he's your enemy, but he's still your dad.

257
00:15:56.759 --> 00:15:59.189
That's more of a reason why I thought it was my job to kill him.

258
00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:02.429
If I killed him myself,

259
00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:05.269
I figured people would be able to realize...

260
00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:08.439
how bad of a person Lee Kwang Ho really was.

261
00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:13.740
I never really knew his face until now,

262
00:16:15.639 --> 00:16:16.750
but he's still my dad.

263
00:16:21.049 --> 00:16:22.120
Good job.

264
00:16:23.049 --> 00:16:24.090
You did well.

265
00:16:25.549 --> 00:16:27.159
I'm proud that you didn't kill him.

266
00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.529
It must've been hard for you to stay calm in that situation.

267
00:16:34.259 --> 00:16:35.330
Good job.

268
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.740
Sometimes, there are cases that can be extenuated.

269
00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:45.110
No one got hurt, and no one filed a report.

270
00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:47.539
And there's no risk of secondary offense.

271
00:16:48.809 --> 00:16:50.950
So now, I'm going to release you with a warning.

272
00:16:52.809 --> 00:16:54.549
But still...

273
00:16:54.549 --> 00:16:55.880
Don't try to argue with me.

274
00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:00.220
I haven't filed your resignation letter yet.

275
00:17:02.189 --> 00:17:03.490
You're currently on a leave.

276
00:17:05.389 --> 00:17:07.659
So do things with the power you have as an officer.

277
00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:09.969
Stop upsetting me.

278
00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:13.300
Let's go.

279
00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:21.840
You might've failed to kill him, but you still need to catch him.

280
00:17:25.409 --> 00:17:26.479
That's an order.

281
00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:28.449
Let's go.

282
00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:46.570
- Let's go, you guys. - Okay.

283
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:48.770
Wait a minute.

284
00:17:50.669 --> 00:17:51.739
Come inside.

285
00:17:54.239 --> 00:17:56.649
Officer Oh's done taking a leave.

286
00:17:56.749 --> 00:17:58.179
He'll be joining our team again.

287
00:18:01.219 --> 00:18:04.419
Hey, why are you acting as if it's your first time coming here?

288
00:18:04.419 --> 00:18:07.719
It's probably because he had a blast while taking some time off.

289
00:18:07.919 --> 00:18:09.189
Where's Lee Kwang Ho right now?

290
00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:12.860
He's at work right now. He's at the Korea Economic Institute.

291
00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:15.659
My gosh, he's so persistent.

292
00:18:15.659 --> 00:18:18.070
That's great. Let's go get him.

293
00:18:18.729 --> 00:18:21.169
There's nothing special about arresting someone without a warrant.

294
00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:22.840
Just follow the procedures.

295
00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.209
Do you think he'll come quietly?

296
00:18:24.409 --> 00:18:26.979
We won't be able to bring him easily because of his bodyguards.

297
00:18:26.979 --> 00:18:29.949
They'll try to protect him, but we have to catch him.

298
00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:34.320
I can't forget what I went through. I'm not going to lose him this time.

299
00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.449
You can lose him.

300
00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:39.120
But make sure no one gets hurt.

301
00:18:39.489 --> 00:18:41.360
Always put your safety first, okay?

302
00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:42.459
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

303
00:18:42.459 --> 00:18:43.729
- Let's go. - Yes, sir.

304
00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:01.110
What are you doing? Why aren't you getting off?

305
00:19:01.939 --> 00:19:02.979
You can go.

306
00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:05.580
You need to be the one to handcuff Lee Kwang Ho.

307
00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:07.580
I just feel uncomfortable right now.

308
00:19:07.919 --> 00:19:08.919
You should go.

309
00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:18.290
Move!

310
00:19:18.459 --> 00:19:19.699
What are you doing?

311
00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:22.499
What do you think you're doing?

312
00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:27.540
(Lee Kwang Ho)

313
00:19:29.399 --> 00:19:30.469
What's this?

314
00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:34.239
Mr. Lee Kwang Ho.

315
00:19:34.739 --> 00:19:37.979
You're under arrest for instigating murder.

316
00:19:41.219 --> 00:19:44.290
Let me go! You're going to get charged for obstruction of justice.

317
00:19:44.419 --> 00:19:45.649
I'm going to arrest you all!

318
00:19:45.649 --> 00:19:46.760
Wait.

319
00:19:47.489 --> 00:19:49.459
How dare you try to arrest me?

320
00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:56.300
You're just a cop, and I'm a former president.

321
00:19:59.669 --> 00:20:02.340
Let me tell you what a cop's job is.

322
00:20:02.939 --> 00:20:05.340
It is to arrest suspects who are under suspicion of a certain crime.

323
00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:07.610
General Manager Kwak testified that...

324
00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:09.749
you ordered him to murder someone.

325
00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:11.949
With a testimony like that,

326
00:20:12.249 --> 00:20:15.350
we can arrest anyone even if that person is the leader of a gang...

327
00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:17.189
or a former president.

328
00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:19.820
If we're not able to prove the suspicion,

329
00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:21.560
then we'll follow the law...

330
00:20:21.959 --> 00:20:24.189
and release you within 48 hours.

331
00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:26.130
Let's go.

332
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:27.760
Arrest him.

333
00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:31.229
What are you doing? Call the chief of police.

334
00:20:31.729 --> 00:20:32.800
Stop.

335
00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:42.909
Everyone, get out.

336
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:45.510
What are you doing?

337
00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:46.679
What do you think?

338
00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:51.189
I'm doing my job. In other words, I'm directing this investigation.

339
00:20:56.219 --> 00:20:59.389
What are you doing? Back off.

340
00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.870
I'm sorry if they offended you.

341
00:21:10.139 --> 00:21:14.310
We were all too excited at the fact that we might be able to arrest you.

342
00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:16.749
So we were out of sync today.

343
00:21:18.479 --> 00:21:20.820
Anyway, we're going to...

344
00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.290
back off for today.

345
00:21:23.889 --> 00:21:26.249
But don't be too happy.

346
00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:29.729
We're going to...

347
00:21:30.389 --> 00:21:33.530
officially arrest you soon.

348
00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:36.429
In your dreams. That will never happen.

349
00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:46.909
Let's go.

350
00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:49.310
Inspector Park.

351
00:21:57.550 --> 00:22:00.620
My gosh, let's go now.

352
00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:08.659
Bye, sir.

353
00:22:23.209 --> 00:22:24.610
My goodness.

354
00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:29.320
You guys are always giving me such a hard time.

355
00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:32.290
It wasn't easy for us to try arresting him without a warrant.

356
00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:35.620
Inspector Park put his job on the line. What did you do?

357
00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:39.360
Let me tell you a little something about how to deal with politics...

358
00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:42.459
since you police officers don't seem to know anything.

359
00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:45.830
We can't just arrest...

360
00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:49.600
people like Lee Kwang Ho just because they committed a crime.

361
00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:52.310
The people have to start talking about him,

362
00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:56.449
and that's what's going to move the prosecution and court.

363
00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:58.649
Don't you remember what happened to me...

364
00:22:58.649 --> 00:23:01.780
when I tried to catch Lee Kwang Ho and his 100 million dollars?

365
00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:03.590
I ended up becoming an outcast.

366
00:23:06.419 --> 00:23:09.320
He's a former president...

367
00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:11.929
who still has a lot of people...

368
00:23:11.929 --> 00:23:14.100
supporting him.

369
00:23:14.459 --> 00:23:16.130
Even if there's a live broadcast of him...

370
00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:19.630
getting escorted by the police into Public Prosecutors' Office,

371
00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:21.439
people will still complain that we're not being respectful.

372
00:23:21.439 --> 00:23:24.310
But what do you think will happen if you arrest him without a warrant?

373
00:23:24.639 --> 00:23:28.340
People will only think of it as some kind of political retaliation.

374
00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:32.909
People will only focus on his arrest rather than his crime itself.

375
00:23:32.909 --> 00:23:35.749
If that happens, we won't be able to have him locked up.

376
00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:37.689
Do you understand?

377
00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:39.889
Then how are you planning to catch him?

378
00:23:39.889 --> 00:23:41.060
At this moment,

379
00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:43.429
we can't.

380
00:23:43.429 --> 00:23:47.360
I thought you had a solution. I'm disappointed in you.

381
00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:48.459
You're disappointed?

382
00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:51.270
I'm sorry.

383
00:23:51.499 --> 00:23:55.399
I used to have someone from the NIS to back me up.

384
00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:57.310
But she suddenly disappeared.

385
00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:59.939
I wonder who took her away from me?

386
00:24:00.409 --> 00:24:01.439
That's...

387
00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:05.050
I have...

388
00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:06.620
a solution.

389
00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:25.899
Chairwoman Gook and An Tae Jung.

390
00:24:26.969 --> 00:24:29.499
I must to teach both of them a lesson.

391
00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:33.610
First, you should start off with Chairwoman Gook.

392
00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:35.679
Yes, sir.

393
00:24:42.749 --> 00:24:44.120
I must've been crazy.

394
00:24:44.749 --> 00:24:45.820
I worked with him for 20 years,

395
00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:47.889
and I don't have a single thing to stab him in the back with.

396
00:24:48.389 --> 00:24:50.929
(Erim Food)

397
00:25:09.679 --> 00:25:12.110
If you took it, you should've used it right.

398
00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:13.919
You're too soft.

399
00:25:15.149 --> 00:25:16.889
I guess you couldn't kill your dad,

400
00:25:16.889 --> 00:25:18.520
Lee Kwang Ho, that horrible scumbag.

401
00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:19.620
Don't get it wrong.

402
00:25:20.689 --> 00:25:23.130
You would've been next after killing Lee Kwang Ho.

403
00:25:24.229 --> 00:25:26.729
Did you forget what you did when Ddak Ji died?

404
00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:30.370
You say Lee Kwang Ho is horrible because he killed your son.

405
00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:32.630
Then you should know...

406
00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:36.199
how horrible you are to me since you killed Ddak Ji.

407
00:25:36.199 --> 00:25:37.340
Don't you dare compare them.

408
00:25:38.169 --> 00:25:41.439
My son and that street rat aren't the same.

409
00:25:41.439 --> 00:25:44.209
If he was so precious, you shouldn't have given him up.

410
00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:46.749
Stop your nonsense,

411
00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:50.090
and get ready to go to jail.

412
00:25:50.989 --> 00:25:52.790
Prosecutor Kim will summon you soon.

413
00:26:56.919 --> 00:26:57.989
Where are you going?

414
00:27:01.959 --> 00:27:03.290
Well...

415
00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:07.729
I got an urgent call.

416
00:27:13.969 --> 00:27:17.340
By the way, why are you here at this hour?

417
00:27:17.469 --> 00:27:20.939
The caregiver had to leave for a couple of hours.

418
00:27:20.939 --> 00:27:22.639
So she asked me to stay here.

419
00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:25.010
She should be here soon.

420
00:27:26.050 --> 00:27:27.249
Is that right?

421
00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:29.850
I see.

422
00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:35.459
Then I should go pick up Kang.

423
00:27:35.459 --> 00:27:37.330
The school must be out.

424
00:27:38.229 --> 00:27:40.729
I can go pick him up.

425
00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:44.969
Is there something you want to say?

426
00:27:45.669 --> 00:27:48.540
How about bringing him here?

427
00:27:49.439 --> 00:27:50.469
Since...

428
00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:51.770
You're right.

429
00:27:52.709 --> 00:27:54.380
We should bring him here.

430
00:27:55.979 --> 00:27:59.050
Chul Gi is Kang's real dad. Kang should know.

431
00:28:01.149 --> 00:28:04.850
What if Kang gets confused though?

432
00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:08.290
It won't be easy for Kang to see him sick in bed.

433
00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:10.889
We'll have to take good care of him.

434
00:28:15.159 --> 00:28:18.570
If you're uncomfortable with this...

435
00:28:18.570 --> 00:28:21.100
I'm not. Not at all.

436
00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:27.280
I hope that Kang visiting will help Chul Gi get better soon.

437
00:28:29.679 --> 00:28:31.550
I'll go get Kang.

438
00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:42.689
Who are you?

439
00:28:42.919 --> 00:28:44.959
Let me go.

440
00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:49.199
Did Lee Kwang Ho order this?

441
00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:52.830
Let go.

442
00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:55.469
Kyung Jae, you're making a mistake.

443
00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:56.870
Let's move.

444
00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:01.409
Hey! Let me go!

445
00:29:01.709 --> 00:29:02.810
Let go!

446
00:29:03.149 --> 00:29:04.280
Move quickly.

447
00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:08.120
Move quickly?

448
00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:12.449
Assistant Manager Ki. Calm down. Where are you?

449
00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:16.020
Okay. We're on our way now.

450
00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:20.899
All right. Cheerfully.

451
00:29:20.899 --> 00:29:23.169
Smile. Shoulders first.

452
00:29:23.169 --> 00:29:25.999
Roll your shoulders. 1, 2.

453
00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:27.870
1, 2.

454
00:29:28.999 --> 00:29:30.909
Last one.

455
00:29:34.209 --> 00:29:36.550
Let go!

456
00:29:37.979 --> 00:29:40.179
I'm not crazy!

457
00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:41.620
Get away!

458
00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:44.189
Let go!

459
00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:46.149
Let me go!

460
00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:49.419
Ma'am! I'll take care of them!

461
00:29:49.419 --> 00:29:50.729
- Assistant Manager Ki. - Let her go!

462
00:29:50.729 --> 00:29:51.860
Do something!

463
00:29:56.399 --> 00:29:59.199
Are you crazy? How dare you...

464
00:29:59.399 --> 00:30:00.469
Chairwoman Gook!

465
00:30:02.469 --> 00:30:03.540
Let go!

466
00:30:05.639 --> 00:30:06.739
Freeze!

467
00:30:06.739 --> 00:30:08.739
Hey! Freeze.

468
00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:11.550
I'm Kim Min Pyo of Hidden Crime Team.

469
00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:13.020
Let her go.

470
00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:15.550
Before I arrest you for abduction.

471
00:30:18.649 --> 00:30:20.290
Get them!

472
00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:21.320
Gosh.

473
00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:26.899
Stop!

474
00:30:28.729 --> 00:30:30.729
Let's go, ma'am.

475
00:30:53.389 --> 00:30:54.459
Hold still!

476
00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:06.870
Gosh, we got him finally. You jerk.

477
00:31:06.999 --> 00:31:10.510
You have the right to an attorney and the right to remain silent.

478
00:31:11.239 --> 00:31:13.679
How dare you stab a police officer?

479
00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:16.139
What?

480
00:31:16.449 --> 00:31:19.149
They left without saying thank you.

481
00:31:19.179 --> 00:31:21.620
That guy has no manners. No manners at all.

482
00:31:24.749 --> 00:31:25.820
Follow me.

483
00:31:27.544 --> 00:31:30.144
(Final Episode will air shortly.)
