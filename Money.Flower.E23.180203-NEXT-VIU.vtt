(Episode 23)

00:00:11.104 --> 00:00:13.404
(A shocking video clip is widespread online.)

4
00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:17.100
Fellow citizens, I am...

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.739
Na Gi Chul, who used to be a candidate for...

6
00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:22.969
the 19th presidential election from Shindaehan Party.

7
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.410
I am not dead. I am still alive.

8
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.350
I will come back soon...

9
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.820
and reveal all the truth.

10
00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:56.609
I'm Na Gi Chul, a candidate for the 19th presidential election...

11
00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.609
from Shindaehan Party.

12
00:00:58.939 --> 00:01:02.180
I am not dead. I am still alive.

13
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.619
I will come back soon...

14
00:01:05.419 --> 00:01:08.020
and reveal all the truth.

("I Will Reveal the Whole Truth", Na Gi Chul's Announcement)

16
00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:15.160
Fellow citizens, I am...

17
00:01:15.559 --> 00:01:18.460
Na Gi Chul, who used to be a candidate for...

18
00:01:19.059 --> 00:01:20.460
the 19th presidential election from Shindaehan Party.

19
00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:23.699
The whereabouts of Congressman Na who announced...

20
00:01:23.699 --> 00:01:25.600
that he's alive are still unknown.

21
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.940
The police are checking the authenticity of the video...

22
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.610
and looking for the individual responsible for the upload.

23
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.180
Moving onto the next news.

24
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.589
(Mo Hyun)

25
00:01:47.089 --> 00:01:51.029
The phone is turned off. Please leave a message after the beep.

26
00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.309
Secretary Ahn.

27
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.910
I'm leaving the hospital now.

28
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.479
Yes, sir.

29

("I Will Reveal the Whole Truth", Na Gi Chul's Announcement)

30
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.819
I can't believe her father is alive and well.

31
00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.029
Boo Cheon...

32
00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:23.760
must be in great shock.

33
00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:25.730
I'll be back, ma'am.

34
00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:37.040
("I Will Reveal the Whole Truth", Na Gi Chul's Announcement)

(Mooshimwon)

36
00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:02.770
I found out from the news too.

37
00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.240
Na Mo Hyun's cell phone is turned off.

38
00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:08.409
I'm at Congressman Na's house, but no one is here.

39
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.610
Bring in Attorney Kang.

40
00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:28.990
What's your problem now?

41
00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:30.960
This wasn't my doing, sir.

42
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.260
Then who's behind this?

43
00:03:33.529 --> 00:03:34.599
I'm on it now.

44
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.399
Didn't I tell you that he can open his eyes...

45
00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:39.300
but must not open his mouth?

46
00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:44.309
Schedule a visit to see Seong Man tomorrow.

47
00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:46.939
President Jang's questioning...

48
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.409
will end tonight,

49
00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:50.819
and he'll return home with suspension of confinement.

50
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.080
He will be prosecuted and stand trial...

51
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.149
without being held in the detention center.

52
00:03:55.249 --> 00:03:56.290
What?

53
00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.089
- Then... - I imprisoned President Jang...

54
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.390
during the meeting with stockholders...

55
00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.659
because he got in the way of my plan to become the chairman.

56
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.410
I wondered whom this nasty lowlife takes after.

57
00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.540
He takes after me in every way.

58
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.090
Take it back.

59
00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:33.189
I'm giving it back as a celebratory gift for your chairmanship.

60
00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.600
I think Soo Man gave you this necklace...

61
00:04:38.059 --> 00:04:40.459
because he wanted you to use it as a token.

62
00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:44.100
He probably wanted you to show this to me...

63
00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:45.999
when you met me.

64
00:04:48.709 --> 00:04:51.379
Who knew that his time in this world would be so brief?

65
00:04:57.309 --> 00:04:58.350
And...

66
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:00.619
your mother's will.

67
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.819
Take it. And read it thoroughly again.

68
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.059
If you can't understand the will your mother left,

69
00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.559
I wonder how you passed the bar exam with that brain of yours.

70
00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.220
You got discharged.

71
00:05:46.459 --> 00:05:47.470
My father-in-law.

72
00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:52.199
The day we got into the car accident.

73
00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:55.110
The house you followed Mo Hyun to.

74
00:05:55.809 --> 00:05:57.680
I had kept him there.

75
00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.709
I showed him to Mo Hyun that day for the first time.

76
00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.249
And now?

77
00:06:06.079 --> 00:06:07.720
I don't know where he is now.

78
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:09.550
Are you trying to beat me again?

79
00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:11.660
For the safety of Congressman Na,

80
00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:13.490
I think...

81
00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:15.590
his family decided to take care of him themselves.

82
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.300
At the funeral for my father-in-law who had been alive all along,

83
00:06:19.559 --> 00:06:21.100
I had to hold his photo.

84
00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:24.670
Do you know how much...

85
00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.269
Why on earth did you do this?

86
00:06:44.459 --> 00:06:45.559
Boo Cheon.

87
00:06:46.689 --> 00:06:48.090
Honorary Chairman Jang...

88
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.959
pulled off the respirator of Vice Chairman Jang Soo Man...

89
00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:53.660
who was still breathing.

90
00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:59.100
But you should've at least told me.

91
00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:03.540
The more people knew about it, the more dangerous it'd be for him.

92
00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:06.639
What does that mean?

93
00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.809
Are you saying that I'd put my father-in-law in danger?

94
00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:14.090
No one can predict that.

95
00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:17.759
Danger is something we cannot predict.

96
00:07:23.559 --> 00:07:25.030
If you're done, you should go.

97
00:07:27.769 --> 00:07:28.769
The prosecution...

98
00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.199
won't leave him alone. What's your plan?

99
00:07:35.369 --> 00:07:36.410
Boo Cheon.

100
00:07:36.569 --> 00:07:39.780
When I gave your mother my last report,

101
00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:43.709
I was done being Cheong A's dog.

102
00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.350
So...

103
00:07:47.319 --> 00:07:48.819
I should ask someone else?

104
00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:57.329
You said that Uncle Jang would take the fall for bribing Congressman Na.

105
00:07:57.499 --> 00:07:59.930
We were going to submit the false diary with dates of money transfer.

106
00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:02.170
We'll have to see if Congressman Na will stick to the plan.

107
00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:04.300
- Or... - Or he will...

108
00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:06.740
take you and Grandfather down?

109
00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:12.079
It's possible that Executive Jung might be affected too.

110
00:08:13.579 --> 00:08:14.650
Pil Joo.

111
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:18.079
Now that you are not working for me and my mom anymore,

112
00:08:19.449 --> 00:08:20.519
let me ask you a favor.

113
00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:21.920
Boo Cheon.

114
00:08:23.119 --> 00:08:26.889
Is that how you ask for a favor?

115
00:08:28.459 --> 00:08:31.860
Don't you dare leak that I'm not a Jang to the press.

116
00:08:34.599 --> 00:08:37.300
If I have to resign the chairmanship and leave Mooshimwon,

117
00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:39.800
being a Jang is the only thing I have left.

118
00:08:40.969 --> 00:08:43.239
I have lived for 37 years as a Jang.

119
00:08:43.969 --> 00:08:45.339
And I can't...

120
00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.510
live as a nobody now.

121
00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:57.250
Please. I'm begging you.

122
00:08:58.589 --> 00:08:59.689
Pil Joo.

123
00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:06.030
I'm glad that...

124
00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:10.170
Grandfather hates that kind of scandals.

125
00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:13.040
So does Mom.

126
00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:26.520
I am not dead. I am still alive.

127
00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:30.250
I will come back soon...

128
00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.689
and reveal all the truth.

129
00:09:40.599 --> 00:09:42.729
Did you call Attorney Kang?

130
00:09:45.099 --> 00:09:46.699
I will tell him later.

131
00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:51.239
And Dad,

132
00:09:52.939 --> 00:09:54.050
Pil Joo has become...

133
00:09:55.349 --> 00:09:58.120
the chairman of Cheong A while you were unconscious.

134
00:10:03.589 --> 00:10:04.620
We...

135
00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.290
might have to fight against Pil Joo.

136
00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:18.370
Fabricated marriage.

137
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.709
I have evidence that Kang Pil Joo fabricated everything...

138
00:10:22.109 --> 00:10:23.969
from the first meeting of...

139
00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:25.880
Na Mo Hyun and Jang Boo Cheon.

140
00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:42.260
My father only held onto that evidence...

141
00:10:42.359 --> 00:10:44.130
because he was afraid.

142
00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:46.800
But I'm different.

143
00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:51.400
Congressman Na.

144
00:10:52.439 --> 00:10:54.270
Let me give you a simple advice.

145
00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:58.479
As atoning for lying to your daughter until now,

146
00:10:59.339 --> 00:11:00.339
don't you think...

147
00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:04.579
ending your life now...

148
00:11:05.849 --> 00:11:07.790
is the best solution.

149
00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:16.890
(Jang Yeo Cheon)

150
00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:20.699
We'll get to see an unusual scene of...

151
00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:24.439
a grandfather and grandson getting arrested together...

152
00:11:24.969 --> 00:11:26.870
on the same charge.

153
00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:29.270
Mo Hyun.

154
00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.040
Neither you, your mother,

155
00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:36.250
Congressman Na, or Doo Hyun...

156
00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:38.449
ask me...

157
00:11:38.849 --> 00:11:40.920
for the reason.

158
00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:46.290
When I found where you lived and came to see you here,

159
00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:49.689
I told myself not to ask anything.

160
00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:53.599
That's probably what everyone else thought.

161
00:11:56.469 --> 00:11:57.839
No one...

162
00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:02.209
would think Congressman Na...

163
00:12:02.339 --> 00:12:03.969
is at Aide Yang Sang Do's house.

164
00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:08.809
You can pay the debt in your heart...

165
00:12:09.809 --> 00:12:12.620
by protecting my father.

166
00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:34.239
Pil Joo.

167
00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:37.839
Mo Hyun.

168
00:13:02.569 --> 00:13:03.770
The video...

169
00:13:04.569 --> 00:13:06.839
was to protect my father.

170
00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:10.569
If the whole nation knows my father is alive,

171
00:13:13.209 --> 00:13:14.550
Chairman Jang Kook Hwan...

172
00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:16.650
wouldn't try to harm him.

173
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:19.849
Your plan has succeeded for now.

174
00:13:21.449 --> 00:13:22.489
People...

175
00:13:23.319 --> 00:13:25.890
are getting interested in Congressman Na's survival.

176
00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:28.359
Chairman Jang Kook Hwan...

177
00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:31.059
wouldn't try to make a move hastily.

178
00:13:33.599 --> 00:13:36.229
Still, you always have to be careful.

179
00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:39.339
Check if anyone is following you.

180
00:13:40.099 --> 00:13:41.109
Okay.

181
00:13:41.809 --> 00:13:43.140
That's what I'm doing.

182
00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:46.380
I use public transportation.

183
00:13:46.979 --> 00:13:48.510
I transfer several times.

184
00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:52.849
You're doing a good job on protecting Congressman Na.

185
00:13:52.949 --> 00:13:54.790
My father has a strong will...

186
00:13:55.849 --> 00:13:58.160
to recover and reveal the truth.

187
00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:00.420
So...

188
00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.059
he's recovering very fast.

189
00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:05.359
That's great.

190
00:14:06.599 --> 00:14:07.930
I've wondered...

191
00:14:11.199 --> 00:14:12.839
why you'd saved Father...

192
00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:17.010
and disguised the death...

193
00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:22.380
when it'd have been disadvantageous for you...

194
00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:24.180
if ever he recovered.

195
00:14:28.819 --> 00:14:31.189
I've earned the answer...

196
00:14:33.559 --> 00:14:34.829
after thinking about it for several times.

197
00:14:37.599 --> 00:14:40.059
You felt bad...

198
00:14:41.599 --> 00:14:43.599
about my happy marriage breaking...

199
00:14:46.939 --> 00:14:49.109
due to Boo Cheon's affair.

200
00:14:51.239 --> 00:14:52.380
So...

201
00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:56.250
you wanted me to avoid the misfortune of my father's death.

202
00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.219
That's why.

203
00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:05.520
But...

204
00:15:06.459 --> 00:15:08.059
I've started a fight...

205
00:15:08.959 --> 00:15:10.930
despite all you did for me.

206
00:15:13.729 --> 00:15:15.229
So that my father and I...

207
00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.000
have power...

208
00:15:19.569 --> 00:15:20.640
to live a new life...

209
00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:25.510
by revealing the truth.

210
00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:31.280
Don't you...

211
00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:35.089
regret it?

212
00:15:35.719 --> 00:15:36.790
Congressman Na...

213
00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:41.160
will need to see the doctor constantly.

214
00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:44.500
Call the doctor...

215
00:15:47.199 --> 00:15:49.000
and keep getting him checked.

216
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.270
The doctor...

217
00:15:54.739 --> 00:15:56.709
is your close friend.

218
00:15:59.339 --> 00:16:01.510
I have to fight against Cheong A.

219
00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:06.050
I don't think...

220
00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:09.650
I should get any help from you.

221
00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:16.430
Thank you...

222
00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:21.270
for helping my father...

223
00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:26.400
until now.

224
00:16:31.309 --> 00:16:32.339
And...

225
00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:37.880
I'm sorry.

226
00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:51.430
Mom.

227
00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:55.030
You know the mountain your father gave me near Pangyo.

228
00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:57.939
I'll build a house better than Mooshimwon there.

229
00:17:00.569 --> 00:17:01.739
I...

230
00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:05.180
probably can't live for ever in Mooshimwon.

231
00:17:07.239 --> 00:17:09.150
If I have to leave Mooshimwon,

232
00:17:10.979 --> 00:17:12.620
I'll leave lying in a coffin.

233
00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:15.920
I will never...

234
00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:18.390
walk out of Mooshimwon on my feet.

235
00:17:18.959 --> 00:17:21.660
Mom. That's not living. That's holding out.

236
00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:25.400
I'm going to...

237
00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:28.199
bring Pil Joo off from the chairman position...

238
00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:31.400
and pull Grandfather out from Cheong A.

239
00:17:35.939 --> 00:17:38.580
I've already talked to your uncle...

240
00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:40.610
to divide up Cheong A.

241
00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:43.650
Cheong A could survive...

242
00:17:44.519 --> 00:17:46.180
with the help of my father.

243
00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:49.350
Cheong A belongs to us, Boo Cheon.

244
00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:53.989
With your shares and mine,

245
00:17:54.489 --> 00:17:56.689
we can live the rest of our lives with no worries.

246
00:17:57.529 --> 00:17:58.600
Boo Cheon.

247
00:17:58.959 --> 00:18:00.900
That's not living.

248
00:18:01.299 --> 00:18:03.999
You have a chance to be in a higher position than other people.

249
00:18:04.499 --> 00:18:05.799
Why would you...

250
00:18:06.469 --> 00:18:08.570
avoid that chance? Why would you give it to someone else?

251
00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:13.039
Your marriage...

252
00:18:14.209 --> 00:18:15.709
may have ended in a divorce,

253
00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:18.749
but thankfully...

254
00:18:18.749 --> 00:18:20.650
your father-in-law's giving you the last chance.

255
00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:28.330
I'm going to say Kang Pil Joo planned everything...

256
00:18:29.259 --> 00:18:32.160
to become the chairman of Cheong A.

257
00:18:35.229 --> 00:18:36.570
It's the truth.

258
00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:40.070
He persuaded me...

259
00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:43.539
to make you and Congressman Na's daughter...

260
00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:44.709
get married.

261
00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:46.340
Mom. Cheong A...

262
00:18:47.479 --> 00:18:50.209
received so many benefits and grew a lot...

263
00:18:50.209 --> 00:18:52.380
through that marriage for the past five years.

264
00:18:54.789 --> 00:18:56.850
Pil Joo didn't earn anything from it.

265
00:18:57.959 --> 00:18:59.320
What do you mean?

266
00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:02.029
He became the chairman of Cheong A after all.

267
00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:05.860
I'm going to...

268
00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:08.570
tell the world...

269
00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:10.870
Pil Joo took...

270
00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:14.110
the distribution shares I gave him...

271
00:19:14.509 --> 00:19:15.939
by force.

272
00:19:24.519 --> 00:19:25.920
10-million-dollar tax evasion?

273
00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:28.249
That's nothing.

274
00:19:28.449 --> 00:19:30.049
Chairman Won of Taesan Group...

275
00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.390
got caught for 100 million tax evasion,

276
00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:34.789
but he only received probation.

277
00:19:35.759 --> 00:19:37.930
Just say you'll pay the forfeit...

278
00:19:38.259 --> 00:19:40.229
and stand trial sincerely.

279
00:19:41.299 --> 00:19:42.370
Sure.

280
00:19:43.299 --> 00:19:44.340
Father.

281
00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:47.739
Didn't you call me...

282
00:19:48.039 --> 00:19:49.410
to talk about something else?

283
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:51.080
Sure.

284
00:19:52.279 --> 00:19:54.080
Why don't you tell me?

285
00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:58.779
I'd like to enjoy the benefit of having a good son.

286
00:19:59.219 --> 00:20:00.890
I don't really understand...

287
00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:04.160
You mean about Congressman Na...

288
00:20:04.259 --> 00:20:05.289
Correct.

289
00:20:06.219 --> 00:20:08.729
No matter what Congressman Na reveals,

290
00:20:09.029 --> 00:20:12.400
I need you to actively get involved on behalf of Cheong A...

291
00:20:12.699 --> 00:20:14.670
and take care of it.

292
00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:19.900
Congressman Na decided to take his own life...

293
00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:21.769
because he agreed to my idea...

294
00:20:21.769 --> 00:20:24.340
when I desperately pleaded with him.

295
00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:26.779
It was you...

296
00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:29.850
who had to be sent to prison.

297
00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:33.049
I saved you last time,

298
00:20:33.549 --> 00:20:36.019
so now you should cover for me.

299
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:37.689
It's your turn.

300
00:20:44.259 --> 00:20:45.799
You gave way to Pil Joo...

301
00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:49.070
and failed to get back the president post.

302
00:20:50.969 --> 00:20:52.239
Your incompetency...

303
00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:56.969
makes me hard to trust you and work with you...

304
00:20:57.979 --> 00:20:59.410
as a partner.

305
00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:01.509
Speaking of my incompetency,

306
00:21:02.049 --> 00:21:04.009
let me tell you what's even worse.

307
00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:05.979
Regarding Congressman Na's case,

308
00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:09.590
I'll be investigated by the prosecution for Father.

309
00:21:11.459 --> 00:21:14.560
As I couldn't ignore Father's request as his son,

310
00:21:15.759 --> 00:21:17.959
so I came to see you.

311
00:21:18.299 --> 00:21:20.600
We must put our heads together to find a silver bullet...

312
00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:22.769
so that we can share Cheong A together.

313
00:21:24.269 --> 00:21:25.299
Seong Man,

314
00:21:26.039 --> 00:21:27.170
let's deal with it...

315
00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:30.410
by playing different roles.

316
00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:34.680
I will drag Pil Joo down,

317
00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:38.449
and you will take care of Congressman Na.

318
00:21:41.549 --> 00:21:42.620
Congressman Na...

319
00:21:43.189 --> 00:21:45.120
made public that he's still alive,

320
00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:46.759
and it'll work in our favor...

321
00:21:47.259 --> 00:21:49.229
because it made the political fund scandal...

322
00:21:49.459 --> 00:21:52.759
between Cheong A and him come to the fore...

323
00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:54.999
which had been almost forgotten by the public.

324
00:21:57.370 --> 00:22:00.499
While the scandal is in the public eye,

325
00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:03.509
I'll tell the world...

326
00:22:04.279 --> 00:22:06.810
that Kang Pil Joo plotted all this...

327
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:09.410
in order to become Cheong A's chairman...

328
00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:10.920
by all means.

329
00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:13.949
Then...

330
00:22:14.749 --> 00:22:15.989
Congressman Na will...

331
00:22:16.189 --> 00:22:17.189
That's right.

332
00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:19.820
We will use him...

333
00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:21.529
as a tool...

334
00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:23.660
to ignite the public interest only.

335
00:22:25.199 --> 00:22:28.299
We should no longer let him speak as he wants.

336
00:22:31.439 --> 00:22:32.539
After Pil Joo is...

337
00:22:33.199 --> 00:22:35.039
ousted as chairman,

338
00:22:36.039 --> 00:22:38.880
you can let Yeo Cheon take the chairman post then.

339
00:22:40.439 --> 00:22:41.449
However,

340
00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:43.509
you and I will take...

341
00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:47.049
40 and 60 percent of Cheong A shares respectively...

342
00:22:47.789 --> 00:22:48.820
as I am the one...

343
00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:52.090
who will make a greater contribution to dragging Pil Joo out.

344
00:23:06.269 --> 00:23:09.239
Check all the surveillance cameras in Seoul if needed.

345
00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:12.939
We must find him by the end of the day.

346
00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:15.410
Yes, sir.

347
00:24:34.189 --> 00:24:35.330
Pil Joo.

348
00:24:36.529 --> 00:24:39.529
Why did you want to see me at this late hour?

349
00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:41.799
You said you won't come,

350
00:24:42.299 --> 00:24:43.400
but here you are.

351
00:24:43.699 --> 00:24:44.999
You played the file...

352
00:24:45.239 --> 00:24:48.509
that recorded Yeo Cheon's mistake with Congressman Na,

353
00:24:49.709 --> 00:24:51.380
so I had no choice but to come.

354
00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:59.650
When will you quit this silly game?

355
00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:02.019
It only makes both of us weary.

356
00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:06.959
I have a gift for you.

357
00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:29.779
I secured...

358
00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:33.279
all the circumstantial evidence that you instigated...

359
00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:35.049
the murder of Congressman Na.

360
00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:39.820
Your son is on a charge of instigating suicide,

361
00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:42.330
and you're on a charge of instigating murder.

362
00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:44.529
I have enough evidence.

363
00:25:47.699 --> 00:25:49.130
I'll tell you...

364
00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:51.340
when to appear at the police station.

365
00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:53.840
Wait patiently...

366
00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:56.110
until then.

367
00:26:04.049 --> 00:26:05.120
This is...

368
00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:07.620
a warning.

369
00:26:30.469 --> 00:26:31.709
Welcome.

370
00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:47.890
I owe you...

371
00:26:48.759 --> 00:26:50.759
a lot again.

372
00:26:51.029 --> 00:26:53.299
Ms. Na's decision to attract...

373
00:26:54.229 --> 00:26:55.570
the public attention...

374
00:26:56.299 --> 00:26:58.400
by disclosing that you're alive was right.

375
00:27:01.009 --> 00:27:02.209
So...

376
00:27:03.209 --> 00:27:05.080
now that we made it public,

377
00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:07.880
I thought it'd be better...

378
00:27:08.479 --> 00:27:10.680
to treat you at Cheong A Hospital.

379
00:27:10.979 --> 00:27:12.949
If anything bad happens to Dad...

380
00:27:14.519 --> 00:27:15.519
in here,

381
00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:18.920
Cheong A is responsible for it.

382
00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:21.529
Ironically, I find this place safer...

383
00:27:21.729 --> 00:27:24.400
than I thought.

384
00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:30.769
Thank you for taking care of everything.

385
00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:32.299
You're welcome.

386
00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:36.009
The media will...

387
00:27:36.969 --> 00:27:39.080
cover the news that you're at Cheong A Hospital...

388
00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:40.749
shortly.

389
00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:43.180
The more...

390
00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:45.949
people pay attention to Cheong A and you,

391
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:49.749
the safer you will be.

392
00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:52.160
Sir,

393
00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:54.660
I hope you get better soon.

394

(Mooshimjae)

395
00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:21.719
Why did you bring that?

396
00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:26.420
Are you here to see your grandfather as you're discharged?

397
00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.330
Let me see.

398
00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:31.060
You're all right now, right?

399
00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:32.160
I am.

400
00:28:32.529 --> 00:28:33.529
Didn't Grandfather...

401
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:35.799
tell you to send me back?

402
00:28:35.799 --> 00:28:38.340
He adores you so much.

403
00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:40.100
Why would he say that?

404
00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:44.739
He praised your inaugural address so many times.

405
00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:48.410
Please go in. I'll go get some tea.

406
00:29:07.259 --> 00:29:10.130
I've kept it safely just as the way you gave me.

407
00:29:11.469 --> 00:29:12.640
Now I'm returning it to you.

I'm glad you're here, Attorney Kang.

410
00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:16.170
You haven't been here for a while.

411
00:30:18.170 --> 00:30:20.070
- Please fix something up for me. - Hold on.

412
00:30:20.739 --> 00:30:22.140
You knew that he'd be coming.

413
00:30:22.209 --> 00:30:25.180
That's why you told me to cook mushroom stew, his favorite.

414
00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:37.989
I didn't have her cook it for you.

415
00:30:38.689 --> 00:30:41.729
Since Boo Cheon has been discharged, you should move out...

416
00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:43.560
of the house this following weekend.

417
00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:47.699
Is this house yours?

418
00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:50.739
Who are you to tell me to move out?

419
00:30:50.739 --> 00:30:52.299
It's part of my plan...

420
00:30:52.769 --> 00:30:55.239
to kick you out of Mooshimwon.

421
00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:59.939
You will be arrested for murdering Secretary Oh soon.

422
00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:03.410
Wouldn't it be humiliating to be arrested in front of Ms. Icheon?

423
00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:05.380
I will...

424
00:31:06.449 --> 00:31:08.189
save your face.

425
00:31:56.999 --> 00:32:00.539
I returned the abacus to Grandfather.

426
00:32:02.539 --> 00:32:03.610
Good job.

427
00:32:04.539 --> 00:32:05.580
It's nothing anyway.

428
00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:13.420
It's made public...

429
00:32:13.449 --> 00:32:16.590
that Congressman Na is being treated at Cheong A Hospital.

430
00:32:16.650 --> 00:32:18.620
The former congressman has decided that...

431
00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:20.560
paradoxically Cheong A Hospital is the safest place.

432
00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:22.860
The former congressman disclosed his reason for the transfer.

433
00:32:22.959 --> 00:32:26.529
- Kang Pil Joo. - Who would backstab Cheong A...

434
00:32:28.799 --> 00:32:30.600
if it's not Kang Pil Joo?

435
00:32:42.850 --> 00:32:45.620
Secretary Ahn, get ready to go out.

436
00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:49.650
Mom.

437
00:32:50.719 --> 00:32:51.890
Where are you going?

438
00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:57.699
Since Pil Joo made a move,

439
00:32:58.400 --> 00:32:59.430
don't you think...

440
00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:02.769
I should reciprocate his move?

441
00:33:24.189 --> 00:33:26.820
You have been keeping silence until the news of Congressman Na.

442
00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:28.459
Why are you breaking your silence now?

443
00:33:28.459 --> 00:33:30.660
After watching Congressman Na's bravery,

444
00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:32.499
I thought that...

445
00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:34.830
keeping quiet was an act of a coward.

446
00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:36.699
What is the truth between Congressman Na and Cheong A?

447
00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:39.699
Please elaborate on the incident with the illegal political fund.

448
00:33:39.739 --> 00:33:42.039
How did Congressman Na manage to stay alive?

449
00:33:42.209 --> 00:33:45.739
Why do you think only Cheong A suffers from such scandals as this?

450
00:33:46.239 --> 00:33:48.910
- Please make a comment. - Answer our questions!

Executive Jung, voluntary appearance.

("Executive Jung Voluntarily Shows Up at the Prosecutors' Office")

454
00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:13.799
The person behind everything is...

455
00:34:14.069 --> 00:34:16.770
the current chairman of Cheong A's holding company,

456
00:34:17.839 --> 00:34:19.180
Kang Pil Joo.

457
00:34:19.739 --> 00:34:22.080
Chairman Kang Pil Joo has driven out the former chairman unfairly...

458
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:24.549
and stolen the chairmanship.

459
00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:28.120
I believe exposing his illegal acts is the best way to clear this up.

(Yong Goo)

461
00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:36.890
Pil Joo, it's only been...

462
00:34:37.029 --> 00:34:39.629
12 hours since Congressman Na's video was uploaded, and...

463
00:34:39.629 --> 00:34:41.699
Jung Mal Ran made a move already. She's not an easy mark.

464
00:34:42.169 --> 00:34:44.440
Let's request an investigation for Secretary Oh's murder...

465
00:34:44.569 --> 00:34:45.870
and get her arrested.

466
00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:48.109
Prepare it, so we can use that card...

467
00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:50.370
at any time.

468
00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:04.620
Sir, there's a flood of executives' requests for an explanation...

469
00:35:04.819 --> 00:35:06.690
about Executive Jung's statement.

470
00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:09.060
How should I handle this?

471
00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:10.930
Give the press the company's position.

472
00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:14.600
Tell them the statement Executive Jung made...

473
00:35:14.669 --> 00:35:16.230
is far from the truth...

474
00:35:16.770 --> 00:35:19.000
and that the company will take legal action...

475
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.500
for spreading a rumor.

476
00:35:21.069 --> 00:35:23.239
And anyone from Jang's family...

477
00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:27.140
must not attempt to tarnish the chairman...

478
00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:30.310
the board of executives has elected.

479
00:36:02.049 --> 00:36:03.580
Have you had breakfast?

480
00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:08.049
I had a big breakfast since I thought it'd take long.

481
00:36:08.290 --> 00:36:09.719
I appreciate your visit.

482
00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:11.989
I was in charge of this case.

483
00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:14.830
I had to close the case due to Congressman Na's sudden death.

484
00:36:15.859 --> 00:36:17.830
I was very disappointed to close the case.

485
00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:20.460
I can...

486
00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:24.500
help you get rid of half the disappointment you suffered.

487
00:36:24.699 --> 00:36:26.169
Only half?

488
00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:30.140
Congressman Na must resolve the other half.

489
00:36:38.379 --> 00:36:39.379
Yes, Pil Joo.

490
00:36:39.779 --> 00:36:43.049
Prosecutor Kim took the case because it was his case before the suicide.

491
00:36:43.219 --> 00:36:46.560
He was very interested in the case regarding the political bribe.

492
00:36:47.089 --> 00:36:50.899
It's a case that would put him on track for promotion.

493
00:37:02.969 --> 00:37:05.009
Pil Joo, this is causing us a headache. Come up.

494
00:37:05.310 --> 00:37:06.379
I brought you coffee.

495
00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:30.399
Jung Mal Ran is doing her best to torment you.

496
00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:33.140
Do you still want to keep the chairmanship?

497
00:37:33.799 --> 00:37:34.810
Yes.

498
00:37:35.839 --> 00:37:37.210
I plan to keep it.

499
00:37:38.009 --> 00:37:39.109
The chairmanship of Cheong A.

500
00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:43.449
After becoming the chairman,

501
00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:47.120
I realized what I should be doing.

502
00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:52.489
Regardless of the title of a legitimate son...

503
00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:55.290
or a son born out of wedlock,

504
00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:57.730
someone who is competent...

505
00:37:58.299 --> 00:37:59.529
should be the chairman.

506
00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:01.870
I'm showing the world that this is how it ought to be.

507
00:38:06.169 --> 00:38:07.169
I will...

508
00:38:08.569 --> 00:38:10.609
be the first precedent of that.

509
00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:12.810
That's why...

510
00:38:12.839 --> 00:38:14.949
you are always so focused on the 10-year plan...

511
00:38:15.250 --> 00:38:16.509
of developing Cheong A.

512
00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:20.620
You want to be a true leader who will grow Cheong A.

513
00:38:21.419 --> 00:38:24.219
I can guarantee your competence if anyone asks me.

514
00:38:25.290 --> 00:38:28.489
Pil Joo, after you do a good job of leading Cheong A,

515
00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:30.589
you should be a professional CEO...

516
00:38:30.730 --> 00:38:31.960
and go to job interviews.

517
00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.730
And get a job at a competing company of Cheong A...

518
00:38:35.969 --> 00:38:37.600
and destroy Cheong A.

519
00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:01.430
Good things will happen to you, Executive Jung.

520
00:39:02.359 --> 00:39:04.129
The questioning ended earlier than I thought...

521
00:39:04.629 --> 00:39:06.399
since you were very willing to cooperate.

522
00:39:07.569 --> 00:39:10.029
Now, you're free to go home, ma'am.

523
00:39:10.699 --> 00:39:13.140
Right. When Kang Pil Joo extorted...

524
00:39:13.199 --> 00:39:15.370
the shares of Daeil Distribution from you,

525
00:39:15.509 --> 00:39:19.140
please tell me the measures Kang Pil Joo took for the cause.

526
00:39:23.279 --> 00:39:26.819
Tell me if he physically abused you.

527
00:39:31.219 --> 00:39:32.390
Kang Pil Joo...

528
00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:35.730
knew my weakness and blackmailed me.

529
00:39:35.989 --> 00:39:37.399
By weakness...

530
00:39:49.969 --> 00:39:51.339
You're home, ma'am.

531
00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:53.810
Should I prepare lunch?

532
00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:55.750
I had gukbap at the prosecutors' office.

533
00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:58.350
The food must have been difficult for you to have.

534
00:39:59.219 --> 00:40:01.419
You probably didn't eat much.

535
00:40:01.419 --> 00:40:03.819
No, I had it all.

536
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:11.060
There's no word from Mooshimjae?

537
00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:12.129
No.

538
00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:15.730
I think everything is fine.

539
00:40:19.739 --> 00:40:22.940
So Executive Jung said such things in front of the prosecutor.

540
00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:26.379
Okay, Ha Young Do.

541
00:40:35.989 --> 00:40:37.020
Yong Goo.

542
00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:38.790
Pay close attention to online news.

543
00:40:39.819 --> 00:40:41.690
If you see any news about Executive Jung,

544
00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:43.830
delete all of it.

545
00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:50.029
It tastes good.

546
00:40:50.029 --> 00:40:52.940
Ms. Icheon has fried it snack herself.

547
00:40:53.069 --> 00:40:55.839
Executive Jung told her to make it nice for you.

548
00:40:58.739 --> 00:40:59.980
What's wrong?

549
00:41:01.279 --> 00:41:02.680
It's too sweet.

550
00:41:03.949 --> 00:41:05.949
But you've been eating it well.

551
00:41:05.949 --> 00:41:08.750
So there is no news about...

552
00:41:09.149 --> 00:41:11.620
Cheong A today at all?

553
00:41:12.589 --> 00:41:15.660
No, sir. It's very quiet today.

554
00:41:15.989 --> 00:41:19.060
If there is, I would have read it for you by now.

555
00:41:19.799 --> 00:41:22.669
It can't be good that there's no news.

556
00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:27.199
Don't read news to him today.

557
00:41:27.299 --> 00:41:28.370
Why not?

558
00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:30.669
Mom's going to the prosecutor's office today.

559
00:41:35.109 --> 00:41:36.210
Where are you going?

560
00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:39.049
I'll brush my teeth.

561
00:41:57.739 --> 00:42:00.370
Executive Jung Mal Ran who has made voluntary appearance...

562
00:42:00.370 --> 00:42:03.739
at the prosecutor's office today has said something shocking.

563
00:42:03.739 --> 00:42:05.040
Yes, she did.

564
00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:07.310
As per what Executive Jung from Cheong A Group who has...

565
00:42:07.310 --> 00:42:09.879
made a voluntary appearance at the prosecutor's office...

566
00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:13.180
said the current president Kang Pil Joo couldn't have been...

567
00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:15.620
the president with his own skills and performances.

568
00:42:15.649 --> 00:42:18.060
She said he's become the president because he's a son out of wedlock...

569
00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:21.089
of the former president, Jang Soo Man who has passed away.

570
00:42:21.089 --> 00:42:23.190
That's why Kang Pil Joo had preferential treatments.

571
00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:24.230
Right.

572
00:42:29.129 --> 00:42:30.669
Jang Boo Cheon, the former president...

573
00:42:30.770 --> 00:42:32.540
is not the actual son of...

574
00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:35.009
the late former president, Jang Soo Man.

575
00:42:35.609 --> 00:42:38.310
Executive Jung said that the former president Jang Boo Cheon...

576
00:42:38.310 --> 00:42:41.680
was forced to resign regardless of his excellent performances.

577
00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:44.419
She was also threatened about this and,

578
00:42:44.419 --> 00:42:46.779
her shares of Daeil Distribution...

579
00:42:46.779 --> 00:42:49.690
were taken away by force.

580
00:42:49.690 --> 00:42:51.259
It's said as per her claim.

581
00:42:51.919 --> 00:42:55.560
There were many people who said it's quite surprising that...

582
00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:58.000
Kang Pil Joo was selected as the new president.

583
00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.500
It will be now difficult for them to deny the fact that they've done...

584
00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:04.940
this to continue their inheritance among the Jang's family.

585
00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:08.210
More people are sympathizing with Executive Jung...

586
00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:10.069
saying that she must have been forced to do so many things...

587
00:43:10.069 --> 00:43:12.609
so that she eventually had to disclose this news.

588
00:43:12.810 --> 00:43:15.009
Will the last question about Cheong A's scandal be...

589
00:43:15.009 --> 00:43:17.879
answered because of...

590
00:43:17.879 --> 00:43:19.020
Executive Jung's disclosure?

591
00:43:19.419 --> 00:43:21.949
The scandal about Cheong A Group is getting the attention...

592
00:43:21.949 --> 00:43:25.219
because of Congressman Na Gi Chul's survival news.

593
00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:19.480
(Mo Hyun)

594
00:44:21.250 --> 00:44:23.549
I have to be on...

595
00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:26.149
such a scandalous news...

596
00:44:27.219 --> 00:44:28.690
for you to call me.

597
00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:31.919
Boo Cheon.

598
00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:33.819
I'm...

599
00:44:34.589 --> 00:44:36.460
not the son of my father.

600
00:44:40.199 --> 00:44:41.230
But...

601
00:44:42.529 --> 00:44:44.870
I'll be his son until I die.

602
00:44:47.509 --> 00:44:48.770
Until I die.

603
00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:52.680
Could you keep it as a secret...

604
00:44:54.910 --> 00:44:56.250
until the death?

605
00:45:00.319 --> 00:45:01.520
Get out of Mooshimwon...

606
00:45:02.989 --> 00:45:05.160
right now even if you get to live alone.

607
00:45:07.690 --> 00:45:08.859
It will be good for you to live...

608
00:45:10.259 --> 00:45:12.060
far away from your mother.

609
00:45:19.739 --> 00:45:20.810
Mom is trying every way...

610
00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:25.339
to win over Pil Joo.

611
00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:28.649
She doesn't think about me at all.

612
00:45:29.250 --> 00:45:30.680
I've lost everything.

613
00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:34.390
The only thing left for me was that I was the eldest grandson.

614
00:45:37.719 --> 00:45:39.890
My mom threw that in the trash bin.

615
00:45:43.330 --> 00:45:45.600
Pil Joo has no mercy.

616
00:45:47.730 --> 00:45:51.399
There were only two things he could choose since you saved him.

617
00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:53.839
It was either to take a revenge...

618
00:45:56.109 --> 00:45:57.879
or go back to the river.

619
00:45:59.810 --> 00:46:00.879
He's out of his senses.

620
00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:18.500
Let's not meet up again.

621
00:46:22.469 --> 00:46:24.940
It's the first time we're seeing each other since our divorce.

622
00:46:28.310 --> 00:46:31.310
It's driving me mad to realize...

623
00:46:34.149 --> 00:46:35.210
that I have lost you.

624
00:46:41.489 --> 00:46:42.750
Please throw it away for me.

625
00:46:43.449 --> 00:46:46.120
I can't leave it at home.

626
00:46:47.390 --> 00:46:48.529
Thank you for calling...

627
00:46:49.790 --> 00:46:51.259
and worrying about me.

628
00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:55.330
Please don't call me...

629
00:46:58.370 --> 00:47:00.199
even if you hear about me.

630
00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:01.839
Boo Cheon.

631
00:47:04.279 --> 00:47:05.710
If we get to meet up next time,

632
00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:12.379
I don't think I can...

633
00:47:13.919 --> 00:47:15.419
let you go back alone.

634
00:47:19.759 --> 00:47:20.890
That is why.

635
00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:47.690
I heard that your shop and home were connected.

636
00:47:49.149 --> 00:47:50.759
Pil Joo chose a good place for you.

637
00:47:50.790 --> 00:47:51.960
I've seen the news.

638
00:47:55.859 --> 00:47:58.730
You've lost to Kang Pil Joo on your president position.

639
00:48:01.299 --> 00:48:03.569
There's no more reason for you to beg me anymore.

640
00:48:06.799 --> 00:48:09.069
I want to see Executive Jung...

641
00:48:09.069 --> 00:48:10.779
who has treated me so bad...

642
00:48:11.310 --> 00:48:12.940
when she's not even the Jang's family.

643
00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:14.049
Hey...

644
00:48:15.850 --> 00:48:16.910
Seo Won.

645
00:48:19.279 --> 00:48:20.319
I hope Ha Jung stays as...

646
00:48:21.149 --> 00:48:23.319
Yoon Ha Jung.

647
00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:25.419
I came to say this.

648
00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:29.029
Yoon Ha Jung.

649
00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:31.799
Yoon is the real surname.

650
00:48:32.759 --> 00:48:33.799
I hope Ha Jung has...

651
00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:37.330
an actual surname...

652
00:48:37.739 --> 00:48:39.569
instead of my fake surname, Jang.

653
00:48:40.069 --> 00:48:41.169
Even if his surname is Yoon,

654
00:48:43.370 --> 00:48:45.810
he'll get the inheritance because he is my son.

655
00:48:48.649 --> 00:48:50.549
I'll get my will written...

656
00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:52.520
regarding...

657
00:48:55.449 --> 00:48:57.049
his inheritance.

658
00:49:08.730 --> 00:49:10.770
(Jung Mal Ran at the prosecutor's office)

659
00:49:10.770 --> 00:49:13.569
I can't stop the news from getting spread.

660
00:49:13.699 --> 00:49:15.540
This is pointless.

661
00:49:16.210 --> 00:49:18.109
Take action on Secretary Oh's case.

662
00:49:19.879 --> 00:49:25.379
(Mooshimwon)

663
00:50:20.569 --> 00:50:22.339
This is Executive Jung Mal Ran's cell phone.

664
00:50:22.569 --> 00:50:24.509
I'm calling from Incheon Jungbu police station.

665
00:50:24.609 --> 00:50:26.609
Can I talk to Ms. Jung Mal Ran now?

666
00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:28.009
What's the matter?

667
00:50:28.779 --> 00:50:30.250
I'm her son.

668
00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:32.819
Tell her to call us back.

669
00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:34.850
Or we have to move.

670
00:50:34.989 --> 00:50:36.390
What is the matter?

671
00:50:37.489 --> 00:50:40.190
I can't tell you. It's her privacy.

672
00:50:40.730 --> 00:50:43.190
Tell her it's about Oh Ki Pyung.

673
00:51:56.069 --> 00:51:58.699
Mom. The police station wants you to call them.

674
00:51:59.199 --> 00:52:00.399
It's about Secretary Oh.

675
00:52:05.109 --> 00:52:06.180
Kang Pil Joo.

676
00:52:08.779 --> 00:52:09.810
How dare you...

677
00:52:21.690 --> 00:52:24.460
Ms. Jung Mal Ran? This is the police station.

678
00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:39.980
The doctor told him...

679
00:52:40.339 --> 00:52:41.879
he must go to the hospital,

680
00:52:42.410 --> 00:52:45.379
but he said he's too embarrassed...

681
00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:47.520
to leave Mooshimwon.

682
00:53:17.009 --> 00:53:18.049
Pil Joo.

683
00:53:19.350 --> 00:53:20.580
You won.

684
00:53:24.390 --> 00:53:26.160
I've decided to go to the police station.

685
00:53:31.529 --> 00:53:33.100
Let's have a farewell drink.

686
00:55:31.180 --> 00:55:32.180
Secretary Ahn.

687
00:55:33.879 --> 00:55:34.989
That's not it.

688
00:55:35.989 --> 00:55:37.620
Those flowers don't match the theme today.

689
00:57:08.109 --> 00:57:09.149
You know what?

690
00:57:09.949 --> 00:57:11.379
Boo Cheon's biological father,

691
00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:13.819
Secretary Oh's death...

692
00:57:16.489 --> 00:57:17.919
was the best bonus...

693
00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:20.160
you ever gave me.

694
00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:28.600
Thanks to that,

695
00:57:29.299 --> 00:57:31.870
my revenge is done...

696
00:57:35.870 --> 00:57:37.779
faster and fuller.

697
00:58:54.649 --> 00:58:55.649
Pil Joo.

698
00:59:02.430 --> 00:59:03.460
Both of us...

699
00:59:06.830 --> 00:59:08.370
will leave Mooshimwon...

700
00:59:11.169 --> 00:59:12.940
lying in the coffin side by side.

701
00:59:32.719 --> 00:59:33.719
Right.

702
00:59:35.859 --> 00:59:36.930
You and I...

703
00:59:40.330 --> 00:59:42.299
shared poisonous drink.

704
00:59:43.569 --> 00:59:44.569
Pil Joo.

705
01:00:47.770 --> 01:00:48.870
How was...

706
01:00:49.930 --> 01:00:51.069
my acting?

707
01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:08.589
Fortunately,

708
01:01:09.850 --> 01:01:12.460
there is still someone who worries about you...

709
01:01:12.890 --> 01:01:13.989
in Mooshimwon.

710
01:01:19.299 --> 01:01:20.330
Executive Jung,

711
01:01:21.529 --> 01:01:24.140
your life isn't yours.

712
01:01:25.299 --> 01:01:26.399
You'll have to...

713
01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:29.569
pay for your wrongdoings in prison.

714
01:01:36.009 --> 01:01:38.750
Taking your own life is not...

715
01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:41.520
part of my plan.

716
01:01:47.759 --> 01:01:48.790
Detectives will...

717
01:01:49.759 --> 01:01:51.199
get here soon.

718
01:02:56.790 --> 01:03:00.029
