00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.350
What is this?

2
00:01:20.951 --> 00:01:22.951
Water...

3
00:01:33.431 --> 00:01:34.431
What is this?

4
00:01:55.091 --> 00:01:56.151
Hello.

5
00:01:57.621 --> 00:01:59.720
Yes, speaking.

6
00:02:01.961 --> 00:02:02.961
What?

7
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.160
I'm sorry.

8
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.531
If you could give us a little more time,

9
00:02:09.531 --> 00:02:11.131
we'll pay the bills this week.

10
00:02:12.041 --> 00:02:13.071
What?

11
00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.210
How are we going to run this place then?

12
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.541
Hello? Hello?

13
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.080
What's the noise? What happened?

14
00:02:27.851 --> 00:02:30.791
They're cutting off the water because we haven't paid the bills.

15
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.691
What?

16
00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.661
- When? - Right now.

17
00:02:40.531 --> 00:02:43.930
Hey. Do you think this is funny?

18
00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:47.840
Didn't I tell you I hate this kind of prank?

19
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.011
Hey. Seriously...

20
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:53.710
Dong Gu.

21
00:02:53.941 --> 00:02:56.610
Turn the water back on, or you'll get in huge trouble.

22
00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.281
Hey.

23
00:02:58.281 --> 00:03:00.251
Dong Gu is here.

24
00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.951
Stop playing a prank on me, and turn the water back on!

25
00:03:03.951 --> 00:03:05.661
A prank?

26
00:03:05.661 --> 00:03:07.691
The water got cut off because we didn't pay the bills.

27
00:03:08.061 --> 00:03:09.291
The water got cut off?

28
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.170
Didn't I tell you to pay the bills in time?

29
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.541
It's not like I didn't want to pay the bills.

30
00:03:20.541 --> 00:03:22.210
We couldn't pay it because we don't have the money to.

31
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:23.710
The water bill can't be that high.

32
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.740
- It was 420 dollars. - 420 dollars?

33
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.610
- Yes. - That is high.

34
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.050
Still, you're a CEO. You don't even have 420 dollars?

35
00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.691
- It's all your fault. - What did you say?

36
00:03:34.691 --> 00:03:36.451
Guesthouses are a blue ocean?

37
00:03:36.451 --> 00:03:39.321
Chinese tourists will come swarming in?

38
00:03:39.321 --> 00:03:41.561
We'll make a ton of money and produce films?

39
00:03:41.561 --> 00:03:44.061
I didn't expect THAAD would become an issue.

40
00:03:44.231 --> 00:03:46.501
I can't foresee every change in the Northeast Asian political...

41
00:03:46.501 --> 00:03:47.501
Cut it out!

42
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.571
Do you know how much overdue loan interest we have?

43
00:03:49.571 --> 00:03:52.041
We're on the verge of going under.

44
00:03:52.041 --> 00:03:54.870
With the water cut off, how are we going to run this place?

45
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.870
Hey, don't worry.

46
00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.240
We're three guys. We can make 420 dollars in no time.

47
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.610
He's right. Things can't get any worse than this.

48
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.511
Try to be positive, Dong Gu.

49
00:04:04.751 --> 00:04:07.150
What? Be positive?

50
00:04:08.691 --> 00:04:10.990
You're right. I'm the one to blame.

51
00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.990
I made a very big mistake.

52
00:04:13.161 --> 00:04:15.490
We rarely have any guests,

53
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.400
our debt is getting bigger and bigger, and the water got cut off.

54
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.400
But I was being too negative.

55
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.171
I'm so sorry.

56
00:04:22.171 --> 00:04:23.501
Should I go down on my knees?

57
00:04:23.501 --> 00:04:24.900
That's not what I'm saying.

58
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.201
Gosh!

59
00:04:26.201 --> 00:04:27.801
Hey.

60
00:04:27.801 --> 00:04:29.910
Don't take it out on him.

61
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.480
It's okay.

62
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.611
I was out of my mind.

63
00:04:33.811 --> 00:04:37.511
How could I start a business with these idiots?

64
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.150
I was crazy.

65
00:04:40.751 --> 00:04:43.390
What? Be positive?

66
00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.160
Gosh.

67
00:04:47.061 --> 00:04:48.390
Nothing is going my way.

68
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.230
I'm sure...

69
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.160
he has anger management issues.

70
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.361
It's okay. Calm down.

71
00:04:54.361 --> 00:04:55.371
Are you crying?

72
00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.470
Why? We should all be positive.

73
00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.181
What?

74
00:05:07.611 --> 00:05:10.551
Things can't get any worse, so we should be positive?

75
00:05:10.551 --> 00:05:13.421
If things get any worse than this, I'd rather die.

76
00:05:15.951 --> 00:05:16.951
What's this sound?

77
00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:20.921
Where is it coming from?

78
00:05:45.451 --> 00:05:47.580
A baby?

79
00:05:50.621 --> 00:05:51.960
Jun Ki! Du Shik!

80
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.561
- What happened? - What's wrong?

81
00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:55.960
- What is it? - What happened?

82
00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.090
There...

83
00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.001
- What's wrong? - What do you mean?

84
00:05:59.001 --> 00:06:00.861
- Take a look. - What's with you?

85
00:06:00.861 --> 00:06:01.931
- Take a look. - Why?

86
00:06:01.931 --> 00:06:03.030
- What? - Open it.

87
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.201
It's a baby. A baby doll.

88
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.311
- It moves. - What?

89
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.191
It moved.

90
00:06:25.361 --> 00:06:26.790
Our eyes met.

91
00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:28.390
It moved.

92
00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.340
(New World)

93
00:06:49.451 --> 00:06:51.111
How did the baby end up here?

94
00:06:51.111 --> 00:06:52.751
Why?

95
00:06:52.751 --> 00:06:54.020
The baby could be a guest.

96
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.020
We haven't had any guests in a long time.

97
00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.191
That's why we started drinking so early yesterday.

98
00:06:58.191 --> 00:07:00.061
The baby might have come while we were drunk.

99
00:07:00.061 --> 00:07:01.121
Maybe.

100
00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:03.131
I don't remember a thing.

101
00:07:03.761 --> 00:07:05.801
Do you remember anything? You didn't drink.

102
00:07:05.801 --> 00:07:08.001
I went to bed early for my shoot today.

103
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.201
Let's see what's in that bag.

104
00:07:10.201 --> 00:07:11.871
There might be a phone number or something.

105
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:13.140
- Okay. - Okay.

106
00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.621
There's nothing in here.

107
00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:26.751
What's going on?

108
00:07:26.881 --> 00:07:29.321
Maybe the parents went out for a moment.

109
00:07:29.321 --> 00:07:31.261
Does that make sense to you?

110
00:07:31.261 --> 00:07:32.691
What kind of parents...

111
00:07:32.691 --> 00:07:35.090
would leave this tiny baby alone?

112
00:07:35.361 --> 00:07:37.900
Hey, the baby started crying.

113
00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:39.830
- Do something. - You do something.

114
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.501
- What? - Do something.

115
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.071
Well... Why are you crying?

116
00:07:44.071 --> 00:07:45.571
Are you hungry?

117
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:49.340
- There, there. - Did the diaper get wet?

118
00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:56.611
- What's this? - What is it?

119
00:07:56.681 --> 00:07:57.710
Hold on.

120
00:08:01.551 --> 00:08:03.491
Gosh. It's poop.

121
00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:26.741
All right.

122
00:08:29.111 --> 00:08:30.111
I'll open it.

123
00:08:39.291 --> 00:08:42.130
What's the matter? Is it a mess?

124
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:45.801
Well... The thing is...

125
00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:50.130
There's nothing.

126
00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:53.071
- It's a girl. - And?

127
00:08:53.071 --> 00:08:56.610
She might be a baby,

128
00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:59.941
but I'm not sure if it's okay for me to change a girl's diaper.

129
00:08:59.941 --> 00:09:01.980
You have such good manners.

130
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.080
- You're such a gentleman. - What are you talking about?

131
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.181
Cut out the nonsense,

132
00:09:06.181 --> 00:09:08.651
and change the diaper!

133
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.250
Fine, I'll do it!

134
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:13.720
Sorry.

135
00:09:18.531 --> 00:09:20.901
Wet wipes. Give me wet wipes!

136
00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:23.330
- Hurry! - Here.

137
00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:24.701
I want some too.

138
00:09:24.701 --> 00:09:27.441
More! I need more.

139
00:09:27.441 --> 00:09:28.671
Here.

140
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:31.781
Give me a new diaper.

141
00:09:31.781 --> 00:09:33.510
- A new diaper. - Here.

142
00:09:41.791 --> 00:09:43.191
Okay. It's done.

143
00:09:43.321 --> 00:09:44.521
Good job.

144
00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:45.990
Well...

145
00:09:47.021 --> 00:09:48.291
It wasn't that hard.

146
00:09:53.801 --> 00:09:55.330
Wet wipes.

147
00:09:55.801 --> 00:09:58.641
Wet wipes!

148
00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:00.701
Hey.

149
00:10:01.771 --> 00:10:04.781
I fed you, and I even changed your diapers.

150
00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:07.681
But why do you keep crying?

151
00:10:08.311 --> 00:10:10.311
Should we just report her to the police?

152
00:10:10.311 --> 00:10:12.380
What if a customer just left her so that they could take a walk?

153
00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:14.120
He's right. Let's wait for a day.

154
00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.990
It'll be uncomfortable for the baby if we take her to the police.

155
00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:17.151
She's so loud.

156
00:10:17.151 --> 00:10:19.561
We don't have any customers, and the water's off.

157
00:10:19.891 --> 00:10:21.260
And we even have a baby now.

158
00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:23.760
Why does this have to happen to me?

159
00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:26.830
Gosh, my back.

160
00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:28.870
Gosh, my back is killing me.

161
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.771
What? He's not crying. Right?

162
00:10:35.771 --> 00:10:37.271
Hey, that's so cool.

163
00:10:39.141 --> 00:10:40.580
My gosh, that's much better.

164
00:10:43.811 --> 00:10:44.921
- What? - My gosh.

165
00:10:46.551 --> 00:10:48.350
- Why are you crying again? - What did you just do?

166
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:49.551
Try doing what you did again.

167
00:10:49.551 --> 00:10:51.090
Stand up. Try standing up.

168
00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:52.821
All I did was stand up...

169
00:10:53.321 --> 00:10:55.291
and straighten my back like this.

170
00:10:57.931 --> 00:11:01.130
- Hey, stay in that position. - You want me to stay like this?

171
00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:03.271
What else can you do? Otherwise, she'll keep crying.

172
00:11:03.271 --> 00:11:05.041
But I can't stay like this forever.

173
00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.840
Let's take turns then. I'm really exhausted.

174
00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.171
My gosh, look at the time.

175
00:11:10.271 --> 00:11:12.210
I have a movie shoot today. I'll see you guys.

176
00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:14.010
Hey, you said the shoot's in the afternoon.

177
00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:17.110
I'm shooting with Park Sung Woong, the godfather of movie acting.

178
00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:19.551
I need to get there a little early and practice my lines with him.

179
00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:20.850
I'll see you later.

180
00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:24.120
But it's still way too early.

181
00:11:26.561 --> 00:11:27.691
Du Shik.

182
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:30.531
I have to go to a part-time job. I wish you the best of luck.

183
00:11:30.531 --> 00:11:32.061
No, wait. What part-time job?

184
00:11:32.061 --> 00:11:33.960
I have to work at the convenience store.

185
00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.500
- Hey, come on. - Good luck.

186
00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.571
You can't just leave me here. Du Shik!

187
00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.571
My gosh, this is driving me crazy.

188
00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:49.750
Hello? Hey, Soo Ah. What's up?

189
00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.551
Something important?

190
00:11:53.181 --> 00:11:54.250
Right now?

191
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:56.421
That's great. One.

192
00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:58.321
Okay.

193
00:11:59.291 --> 00:12:01.161
You look great. Okay.

194
00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:02.531
Smile.

195
00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.031
One last shot.

196
00:12:06.701 --> 00:12:08.830
Okay. Good job.

197
00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:10.071
Thank you.

198
00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:24.110
(Yuhan Bank: Please check your loan and repay it as soon as possible.)

199
00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:30.590
Soo Ah, I'm here.

200
00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:31.921
Hey, you're here.

201
00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:34.730
- Who's that? - Oh, her.

202
00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:39.031
Well, the thing is, I woke up this morning and there was...

203
00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.801
I don't know. Whatever. It's a long story.

204
00:12:41.801 --> 00:12:43.230
- Good luck. - Thank you.

205
00:12:43.571 --> 00:12:46.600
Soo Ah, you're the reason I'm still alive.

206
00:12:47.141 --> 00:12:48.271
What did you want to say to me?

207
00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:50.641
Let's stop seeing each other.

208
00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:53.710
What?

209
00:12:54.141 --> 00:12:57.380
You... You want to break up? What are you talking about?

210
00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:00.380
Well... Let's just break up.

211
00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.691
Why? What's the reason?

212
00:13:03.691 --> 00:13:05.860
It's going to take more than four days to tell you everything.

213
00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.120
Let's just end it.

214
00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.431
Tell me why.

215
00:13:08.431 --> 00:13:10.691
I'm willing to hear everything regardless of how long it may take.

216
00:13:10.691 --> 00:13:12.960
Really? Okay, then.

217
00:13:13.061 --> 00:13:14.830
Number one. You're too immature.

218
00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:16.730
Number two. You're incompetent.

219
00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:18.470
Number three. I can't see a bright future ahead of you.

220
00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:20.970
Number 4. You're too... Number 5... Number 6...

221
00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:23.941
Number 7... Number 87... Number 89...

222
00:13:23.941 --> 00:13:25.340
Your hairstyle is gross.

223
00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:28.380
Number 90. I hate the sound you make when you eat.

224
00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:30.250
- Number 99. You're... - That's enough.

225
00:13:31.521 --> 00:13:32.951
Okay, I get it. That's enough.

226
00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:37.590
How did you manage to stay with me for so long?

227
00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.120
Did you even love me at all?

228
00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.120
Love? Of course, I did.

229
00:13:41.531 --> 00:13:44.260
But love can't keep our relationship going.

230
00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:45.661
You sound really materialistic.

231
00:13:45.661 --> 00:13:49.071
I'm not materialistic. You're just immature.

232
00:13:49.701 --> 00:13:51.740
Anyway, thank you for all the good memories.

233
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:53.600
I'll return this to you.

234
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:57.210
Okay, fine. Let's end it.

235
00:13:57.370 --> 00:14:00.541
Hey, I don't need that ring. Do whatever you want with it.

236
00:14:00.541 --> 00:14:03.380
Thank you so much for going out with a loser like me.

237
00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:05.580
I hope you live a great life.

238
00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:21.531
Okay. Let's practice one more time and start shooting.

239
00:14:21.531 --> 00:14:22.701
- Okay. - Okay.

240
00:14:23.531 --> 00:14:25.071
- You better do well. - Hey.

241
00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:26.541
Hey, you're here.

242
00:14:26.771 --> 00:14:30.740
I begged the director to give you this role, so you better do well.

243
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:31.980
Okay, I will.

244
00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:36.051
Will you be giving me my pay as soon as we're done shooting?

245
00:14:36.051 --> 00:14:37.151
Yes, of course.

246
00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:40.580
By the way, you didn't say hi to Park Sung Woong yet, did you?

247
00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:42.821
- Let's go. Let me introduce you. - Okay.

248
00:14:50.691 --> 00:14:53.760
Sung Woong, he's Lee Jun Ki. He'll be acting with you today.

249
00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:55.531
("Cold-blooded")

250
00:14:57.830 --> 00:14:59.000
Hello, sir.

251
00:14:59.441 --> 00:15:03.240
I'm so honored to be able to act with you, sir.

252
00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:08.681
What?

253
00:15:15.151 --> 00:15:16.250
Pardon?

254
00:15:20.191 --> 00:15:21.291
Sorry?

255
00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:27.730
Sung... Sung Woong.

256
00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:30.100
What's going on?

257
00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:32.401
- Did I do something wrong? - Why are you so slow?

258
00:15:32.701 --> 00:15:35.811
He just complimented your eyes. Why couldn't you catch that?

259
00:15:36.811 --> 00:15:39.840
- When? - He did this to you.

260
00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:40.980
Is that what he meant by that?

261
00:15:41.651 --> 00:15:43.311
He could've just told me. Why did he have to do that?

262
00:15:43.311 --> 00:15:45.181
He's not a very talkative man.

263
00:15:45.181 --> 00:15:48.620
And he hates it when people don't understand him, so be careful.

264
00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:50.220
- Okay? - Okay.

265
00:15:50.321 --> 00:15:51.391
See you later.

266
00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:55.960
He doesn't talk, but he doesn't like it when people don't understand him?

267
00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:57.291
What does he want?

268
00:16:00.901 --> 00:16:02.470
Is that what you call charisma?

269
00:16:03.801 --> 00:16:06.470
My gosh, that was so charismatic.

270
00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:14.750
Ready.

271
00:16:15.551 --> 00:16:16.681
Action!

272
00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:22.850
Cut. What's wrong, Sung Woong?

273
00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:32.600
Me?

274
00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:37.941
Pardon?

275
00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:45.441
What... What?

276
00:16:50.951 --> 00:16:53.951
Sung Woong, where are you going? Sung Woong!

277
00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.990
Hey, who brought him here?

278
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:01.061
I'm sorry, sir.

279
00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:03.061
My gosh.

280
00:17:05.031 --> 00:17:06.161
Move.

281
00:17:06.601 --> 00:17:09.070
Hey, why are you so out of it?

282
00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:10.331
What did I do?

283
00:17:10.331 --> 00:17:13.500
He told you to take a step back. Why didn't you get that?

284
00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:14.770
He asked me to take a step back?

285
00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:16.911
- When? - He kept doing...

286
00:17:17.611 --> 00:17:19.881
this to you. He repeated it three times.

287
00:17:19.881 --> 00:17:21.651
I thought that meant he liked my eyes.

288
00:17:21.651 --> 00:17:23.550
That differs according to the situation.

289
00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:25.181
Why are you so slow-witted?

290
00:17:27.151 --> 00:17:28.290
Sung Woong.

291
00:17:30.691 --> 00:17:32.091
He could've just told me.

292
00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:35.490
This is driving me crazy.

293
00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:44.470
Why won't he give me an advance payment?

294
00:17:45.901 --> 00:17:48.111
What am I going to tell Dong Gu?

295
00:17:48.371 --> 00:17:49.570
What a headache.

296
00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:54.111
How does this mean...

297
00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:57.480
My gosh, how am I supposed to know what this means?

298
00:17:58.181 --> 00:17:59.921
Jun Ki. Jun Ki.

299
00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:02.720
- Are you coming home from work? - Yes.

300
00:18:02.891 --> 00:18:04.490
- Are you coming from the store? - Yes.

301
00:18:04.921 --> 00:18:05.960
Do you want one?

302
00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.191
It's only four days past the expiration date.

303
00:18:07.191 --> 00:18:08.230
Gosh, it's okay.

304
00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:10.990
Eat them as much as you want, and live a long life.

305
00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.701
Why are you so irritated? Did something happen?

306
00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:18.901
Oh, right. You had a shoot with Park Sung Woong today.

307
00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:20.841
How did it go? Was he charismatic?

308
00:18:21.871 --> 00:18:23.371
Yes, he was charismatic.

309
00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:26.841
- But he's a little weird. - Why?

310
00:18:26.841 --> 00:18:28.351
He doesn't talk.

311
00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:31.681
But he hates it when people don't understand him.

312
00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:34.990
He doesn't talk, but he hates it when people don't get him?

313
00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:36.851
- That makes no sense. - Exactly.

314
00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:40.591
Here. Let's say I'm Park Sung Woong, and you're me.

315
00:18:40.891 --> 00:18:42.431
During the shoot, he did...

316
00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:45.201
this. What do you think that means?

317
00:18:45.201 --> 00:18:47.131
- Take one step back? - How did you know that?

318
00:18:47.131 --> 00:18:48.500
It's pretty obvious.

319
00:18:50.631 --> 00:18:51.941
Fine. Okay.

320
00:18:52.141 --> 00:18:54.000
What about this? When we first met,

321
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.141
I told him that I was honored to meet him.

322
00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:57.341
And that's when...

323
00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:00.081
he did this. What do you think that means?

324
00:19:00.081 --> 00:19:02.050
- It means he likes your eyes. - You know that too?

325
00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:03.250
Am I the only one who didn't get it?

326
00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:05.050
You just have to be quick-witted for this sort of thing.

327
00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:06.780
- You're really slow. - What?

328
00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:08.191
How are you going to succeed as an actor?

329
00:19:08.421 --> 00:19:09.591
How do you...

330
00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:12.760
My gosh, this finger...

331
00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:17.691
We're home.

332
00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:22.070
Where's the mom?

333
00:19:23.101 --> 00:19:24.201
Are you sick?

334
00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:27.240
What's wrong? Did something happen?

335
00:19:29.941 --> 00:19:32.480
Is it a trend to keep quiet?

336
00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.040
Talk to me, you punk!

337
00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:35.550
I broke up with Soo Ah.

338
00:19:36.111 --> 00:19:38.381
What? Why all of a sudden? What was the reason?

339
00:19:38.881 --> 00:19:41.220
I let her tell me about 90 reasons,

340
00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:42.990
but it felt like she had more to tell me.

341
00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:44.451
Why? You're completely fine.

342
00:19:44.451 --> 00:19:46.621
Hey, it's pretty obvious.

343
00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:49.861
She's getting old, and her family's probably asking her to get married.

344
00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:51.661
But look at him.

345
00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:54.671
He doesn't have a decent job or any money.

346
00:19:54.671 --> 00:19:55.671
He has no future.

347
00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:58.970
His guest house is on the verge of closing down.

348
00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:00.470
I'd break up with him too.

349
00:20:00.901 --> 00:20:01.911
Gosh.

350
00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:06.210
Dating is a luxury for poor people like us.

351
00:20:08.411 --> 00:20:11.480
Is that why you look so depressed?

352
00:20:11.921 --> 00:20:14.320
Don't tell me you begged her.

353
00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:15.790
What are you talking about?

354
00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:18.460
I said, "Fine, I don't need you."

355
00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:20.861
I even took my ring off and threw it on the floor.

356
00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:22.191
Why would you throw it away?

357
00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:24.431
It's gold. Gold is expensive these days.

358
00:20:24.431 --> 00:20:26.601
He's right. We could have sold it and paid the water bills.

359
00:20:26.601 --> 00:20:28.730
What were you thinking?

360
00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:30.030
Should we go and look for it?

361
00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:32.341
Are you crazy? Why would we do that?

362
00:20:32.341 --> 00:20:33.341
I have my pride.

363
00:20:33.341 --> 00:20:34.710
You can stay here and protect your pride.

364
00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:35.911
We'll go and find it. Let's go.

365
00:20:35.911 --> 00:20:38.010
Be quiet. Did you ask around for money?

366
00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:39.710
- Tuna gimbap is my favorite. - That sounds good.

367
00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:42.081
Fine, go ahead and eat.

368
00:20:42.081 --> 00:20:44.750
I had no expectations of you two anyway.

369
00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:47.081
Hey, once I finish my shoot tomorrow,

370
00:20:47.081 --> 00:20:49.550
I'll get paid. Don't worry, you brat.

371
00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:51.691
By the way, what should we do about the baby?

372
00:20:52.091 --> 00:20:53.391
We can't wait for her parents forever.

373
00:20:53.391 --> 00:20:54.460
Whatever.

374
00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:56.030
Let's just report to the police. I'm exhausted.

375
00:20:56.191 --> 00:20:58.260
Let's wait just a little longer, okay?

376
00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:01.101
Let's wait just one more day. I feel sorry for her.

377
00:21:01.101 --> 00:21:03.530
If you feel so sorry for her, you two take care of her.

378
00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:06.070
I've been rocking her all day. My head is spinning.

379
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:08.171
Take over. Take this off me.

380
00:21:08.171 --> 00:21:09.871
- Take a step forward. - Okay.

381
00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:11.040
Here.

382
00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:13.611
Take it off me.

383
00:21:14.181 --> 00:21:16.951
Where are you going? Stop there!

384
00:21:16.951 --> 00:21:18.381
Come here!

385
00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:20.980
Open the door. Did you lock the door?

386
00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:23.421
I'll smash the door. I'm serious.

387
00:21:23.421 --> 00:21:26.121
I'm angry. I'll go get a hammer.

388
00:21:26.121 --> 00:21:27.760
Do you think I can't do it?

389
00:21:29.591 --> 00:21:30.760
Come here!

390
00:21:31.191 --> 00:21:33.631
Open the door. Guys!

391
00:21:34.401 --> 00:21:35.601
Gosh.

392
00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:41.941
Come here.

393
00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:48.710
Because of this tiny baby, I'll get sick.

394
00:21:49.351 --> 00:21:50.651
Those brats...

395
00:21:50.651 --> 00:21:51.820
They've already left?

396
00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:53.651
They're waking up so early now.

397
00:21:53.651 --> 00:21:54.891
They've changed so much.

398
00:21:54.891 --> 00:21:56.191
Can you believe that?

399
00:21:57.451 --> 00:21:58.460
Hello.

400
00:21:58.861 --> 00:22:00.060
Yes, speaking.

401
00:22:00.361 --> 00:22:02.591
What? The electricity bill?

402
00:22:02.591 --> 00:22:04.060
This week?

403
00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:06.060
Our water got cut off. If our electricity gets cut off too,

404
00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:07.730
we can't run this place.

405
00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:09.901
Hello?

406
00:22:10.201 --> 00:22:12.441
He hung up on me. Again!

407
00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.911
Gosh, what should I do?

408
00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:17.570
Tell me what to do, will you?

409
00:22:23.111 --> 00:22:26.651
Come on. You're embarrassing me.

410
00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:35.361
No way. I have my pride.

411
00:22:46.601 --> 00:22:48.970
What are you doing here? Soo Ah is not here yet.

412
00:22:49.111 --> 00:22:51.280
I see. Is it okay if I wait inside?

413
00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:53.310
- Sure. - Thank you.

414
00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:54.911
By the way,

415
00:22:55.351 --> 00:22:56.881
did you clean the studio yesterday?

416
00:22:56.881 --> 00:22:58.381
No. Why?

417
00:22:58.381 --> 00:22:59.581
It's nothing.

418
00:23:21.841 --> 00:23:22.911
What are you doing here?

419
00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:26.141
You're here.

420
00:23:26.881 --> 00:23:29.980
Well... The thing is...

421
00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:31.750
Yesterday you acted like you didn't want to see me again.

422
00:23:31.851 --> 00:23:32.851
What brings you here?

423
00:23:32.951 --> 00:23:36.250
Well... The thing is...

424
00:23:36.421 --> 00:23:37.990
I want to ask you something.

425
00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:40.591
- What is it? - Well...

426
00:23:41.891 --> 00:23:43.691
When do you think the THAAD issue will settle?

427
00:23:47.831 --> 00:23:49.970
You came here to ask me that?

428
00:23:50.331 --> 00:23:51.401
Yes.

429
00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:54.300
We broke up, but we're still both citizens of South Korea.

430
00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:56.210
We can discuss diplomatic issues of this country together.

431
00:23:56.841 --> 00:23:59.341
Can't we? What do you think?

432
00:24:01.681 --> 00:24:03.111
I think...

433
00:24:03.411 --> 00:24:06.681
we can have good conversations from time to time.

434
00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:15.460
Hold on.

435
00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:17.901
What? What is it?

436
00:24:19.131 --> 00:24:21.431
Shouldn't we solve the North Korean nuclear issue first?

437
00:24:21.431 --> 00:24:23.871
We should adopt a two-track strategy where we apply sanctions...

438
00:24:23.871 --> 00:24:25.740
against North Korea and request them to come back to the six-party talks.

439
00:24:28.111 --> 00:24:30.841
Great. It's a nice point.

440
00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:33.010
But are you sure that's the best option?

441
00:24:38.081 --> 00:24:39.351
What do you think we should do then?

442
00:24:39.351 --> 00:24:41.020
How would I know? Politicians will take care of it.

443
00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:42.091
I'm leaving.

444
00:24:42.591 --> 00:24:43.651
What's with you?

445
00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:49.131
Gosh, Dong Gu is so forgetful.

446
00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:52.861
Dong Gu!

447
00:24:52.861 --> 00:24:55.401
(Gold, silver, jewels, watches)

448
00:24:55.401 --> 00:24:58.300
(Jewelry Shop)

449
00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:00.701
Welcome.

450
00:25:00.871 --> 00:25:02.740
Hello. Do you buy gold rings too?

451
00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:04.441
Yes, we do.

452
00:25:04.441 --> 00:25:06.010
What would you like to sell?

453
00:25:06.881 --> 00:25:07.911
This.

454
00:25:10.581 --> 00:25:13.320
Not the dirt, but this ring.

455
00:25:15.191 --> 00:25:18.020
How much can you give me? It's 18K gold.

456
00:25:19.621 --> 00:25:21.191
Is that why you came?

457
00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:26.631
Soo Ah.

458
00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:31.941
If you had told me, I would have helped you find it.

459
00:25:31.941 --> 00:25:34.841
The thing is, we haven't been able to pay the water bills.

460
00:25:34.841 --> 00:25:36.970
So they cut our water, and they said they'll cut our electricity too.

461
00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:38.941
Is that so? Then...

462
00:25:40.411 --> 00:25:41.550
I hope this helps.

463
00:25:44.651 --> 00:25:46.151
You forgot your phone.

464
00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:50.790
Soo Ah.

465
00:26:09.341 --> 00:26:11.841
Sung Woong, you're so funny.

466
00:26:11.841 --> 00:26:13.841
How did you end up in that situation?

467
00:26:19.151 --> 00:26:20.250
That's hilarious.

468
00:26:23.351 --> 00:26:24.490
Hi, Sung Woong.

469
00:26:29.591 --> 00:26:33.030
I'm sorry I didn't understand you yesterday.

470
00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:34.201
Please forgive me.

471
00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:49.010
Thank you for forgiving me.

472
00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:00.921
You understood him this time.

473
00:27:00.921 --> 00:27:02.530
I guess you're getting the hang of it.

474
00:27:02.530 --> 00:27:03.530
Really?

475
00:27:03.891 --> 00:27:05.101
I got it right?

476
00:27:05.101 --> 00:27:06.161
Yes.

477
00:27:06.361 --> 00:27:08.970
He pointed at you and patted you on the shoulder.

478
00:27:09.201 --> 00:27:12.500
Don't get on his wrong side again, okay?

479
00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:15.070
Okay.

480
00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:18.441
I did it.

481
00:27:31.391 --> 00:27:32.760
Oh, my. I'm sorry.

482
00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:36.490
Okay!

483
00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:39.131
Good job.

484
00:27:40.831 --> 00:27:42.730
Thank you for today.

485
00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:50.141
Thank you for your compliment.

486
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:51.540
I'll work harder.

487
00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.050
What? Really?

488
00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:05.661
Okay.

489
00:28:06.161 --> 00:28:09.091
Everyone, Sung Woong will...

490
00:28:09.091 --> 00:28:11.131
treat all of us to beef tonight.

491
00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:18.270
- Park Sung Woong! - Park Sung Woong!

492
00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:21.641
- Park Sung Woong! - Park Sung Woong!

493
00:28:33.050 --> 00:28:35.250
Sung Woong, would you like to make a toast?

494
00:28:41.591 --> 00:28:42.691
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

495
00:28:42.691 --> 00:28:43.730
Thank you.

496
00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:44.800
- Cheers. - Cheers.

497
00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:46.331
- Cheers. - Cheers.

498
00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:03.510
My stomach seems to love the beef. It's been a while.

499
00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:08.351
Sung Woong, thank you for the food.

500
00:29:14.631 --> 00:29:15.891
What's the matter?

501
00:29:18.401 --> 00:29:19.460
Sorry?

502
00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:23.331
What?

503
00:29:25.401 --> 00:29:27.040
What do you mean?

504
00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:17.621
I'm home.

505
00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:26.401
Did something happen? What's with the ambiance?

506
00:30:26.401 --> 00:30:29.570
Jun Ki won't be able to act anymore.

507
00:30:29.901 --> 00:30:31.270
- Why? - Park Sung Woong...

508
00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:32.871
told him to that he had a grain of rice on his face.

509
00:30:33.371 --> 00:30:34.570
But he ended up kissing him instead.

510
00:30:36.111 --> 00:30:37.240
Why?

511
00:30:37.641 --> 00:30:39.480
He was giving me a weird look.

512
00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.181
Anybody would've misunderstood him.

513
00:30:41.411 --> 00:30:44.550
I thought he wanted a kiss on his cheek for buying us beef.

514
00:30:45.851 --> 00:30:46.980
Why do you look so down as well?

515
00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:50.891
Soo Ah caught him selling his ring.

516
00:30:51.391 --> 00:30:52.520
What?

517
00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:55.790
She looked at me...

518
00:30:55.861 --> 00:30:57.730
with so much resentment in her eyes.

519
00:30:59.861 --> 00:31:01.931
Does that mean we'll be able to pay our water bills?

520
00:31:01.931 --> 00:31:03.230
I didn't sell it.

521
00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:06.800
I may have nothing, but I still couldn't sell our couple rings.

522
00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:09.911
Then how are we going to receive any customers without any water?

523
00:31:09.911 --> 00:31:11.171
Exactly.

524
00:31:14.411 --> 00:31:17.921
But I have to say, we're really pathetic.

525
00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:22.421
We're have so much trouble making 400 dollars in 2 days.

526
00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:32.931
Let's give up...

527
00:31:34.101 --> 00:31:35.201
now.

528
00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:37.941
Give up what?

529
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:40.701
I'm saying we should give up on this business.

530
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.570
We promised to earn money, shoot a movie together, and go to...

531
00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:45.710
- the Cannes Films Festival. - Wake up.

532
00:31:45.881 --> 00:31:47.341
We won't be able to shoot a movie.

533
00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:49.151
We should be grateful that we're still alive.

534
00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:52.451
He's right. I also don't think this is going to go anywhere.

535
00:31:53.651 --> 00:31:55.351
The guesthouse and the movie...

536
00:31:55.621 --> 00:31:57.621
Let's just give up now.

537
00:31:58.191 --> 00:32:00.520
All we do in life is give up.

538
00:32:01.191 --> 00:32:02.760
What a lousy life.

539
00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:05.530
But what about her?

540
00:32:06.131 --> 00:32:08.871
What do you think? We should take her to the police.

541
00:32:08.871 --> 00:32:10.871
What can we do? Her parents gave up on her.

542
00:32:10.871 --> 00:32:13.470
But let's at least feed her before we send her away.

543
00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:15.240
We're out of formula too.

544
00:32:29.191 --> 00:32:30.691
Is this what she used to eat?

545
00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:35.191
What? Why is it so expensive?

546
00:32:35.361 --> 00:32:37.631
Don't you have any money? Give me some money.

547
00:32:37.631 --> 00:32:39.060
- Excuse me. - Yes?

548
00:32:39.601 --> 00:32:40.730
That's ours.

549
00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:43.101
We're going to buy it. We just put it down for a second.

550
00:32:43.201 --> 00:32:45.470
Whoever picks it up is the owner.

551
00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:47.401
My gosh, that's ours.

552
00:32:47.401 --> 00:32:49.411
My goodness, what are you doing?

553
00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:52.310
What's wrong?

554
00:32:52.641 --> 00:32:53.710
What's going on?

555
00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:56.681
They're claiming that this belongs to them.

556
00:32:56.681 --> 00:32:59.151
We were going to buy it. We just put it down for a second.

557
00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:02.290
You're fighting over nothing.

558
00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:05.290
Just give it up. You guys are young.

559
00:33:05.290 --> 00:33:06.421
What?

560
00:33:09.361 --> 00:33:10.460
You want us to give it up?

561
00:33:11.131 --> 00:33:12.230
Why?

562
00:33:12.601 --> 00:33:13.960
Why do we need to do that?

563
00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:15.331
Well, that's because...

564
00:33:15.331 --> 00:33:17.431
We did our best, but nothing worked out.

565
00:33:17.431 --> 00:33:21.040
We tried our best, but the world didn't help us out.

566
00:33:21.141 --> 00:33:23.070
We painted the rooms, hung new wallpapers,

567
00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:25.181
and we even did the interior design all by ourselves.

568
00:33:25.341 --> 00:33:27.040
It was our last hope.

569
00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:31.451
- What are you talking about? - We can give up everything else,

570
00:33:31.451 --> 00:33:33.951
but we can't give up on this formula. Okay?

571
00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:35.621
Give that to us!

572
00:33:36.121 --> 00:33:38.391
- Me neither! - Me neither!

573
00:33:55.415 --> 00:34:00.415
<font color="#fcc89b">[VIU Ver] jTBC E01 Eulachacha Waikiki "Welcome to Waikiki"</font>
<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

574
00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:19.530
Did you see her face earlier?

575
00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:23.201
- Her face was completely pale. - I know.

576
00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:26.340
How dare she try to fight us?

577
00:34:28.311 --> 00:34:31.440
It's a great day to have some formula.

578
00:34:32.181 --> 00:34:34.240
We'll warm it up.

579
00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:38.251
What are you doing?

580
00:34:38.681 --> 00:34:39.851
Are you shooting a movie?

581
00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:41.951
Come on. It's fun.

582
00:34:42.391 --> 00:34:44.291
He always breaks the mood.

583
00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:45.791
You're right.

584
00:34:46.521 --> 00:34:49.760
Hey, did you see how we protected your food?

585
00:34:49.961 --> 00:34:51.731
You better not forget this.

586
00:34:51.731 --> 00:34:55.431
He's right. I won't forgive you if you forget this.

587
00:34:55.431 --> 00:34:56.670
They're right.

588
00:34:57.271 --> 00:35:00.001
- My gosh, look at her. - My goodness. She's so cute.

589
00:35:00.201 --> 00:35:02.041
- She's so cute. - Oh, my gosh.

590
00:35:02.771 --> 00:35:04.510
You're right. She's a cute baby.

591
00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:06.110
Thank you.

592
00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:10.880
- Are you tourists? - Yes, we're traveling together.

593
00:35:10.981 --> 00:35:12.320
Where are you going to go now?

594
00:35:12.681 --> 00:35:15.621
Actually, we're looking for a place to sleep.

595
00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:16.891
- Sleep? - Sleep?

596
00:35:16.891 --> 00:35:18.021
Sleep.

597
00:35:19.021 --> 00:35:21.291
- We have a guesthouse. - Oh, really?

598
00:35:21.931 --> 00:35:24.190
Do you happen to have an empty room?

599
00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:26.501
Yes, we do. We have an empty room.

600
00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:28.900
We have many rooms.

601
00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:30.771
Do you guys want a room?

602
00:35:30.771 --> 00:35:31.940
- Yes, sure. - Yes.

603
00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:33.101
Tonight?

604
00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:35.510
Tonight! Let's go!

605
00:35:35.871 --> 00:35:38.641
Let's go, you guys. We have customers tonight.

606
00:35:38.641 --> 00:35:40.780
Okay, okay. Follow me.

607
00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:42.481
Follow me.

608
00:35:44.110 --> 00:35:45.351
Let's go.

609
00:35:47.451 --> 00:35:48.550
Guests?

610
00:35:48.891 --> 00:35:49.990
Guests.

611
00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:53.791
- Guests. - Guests.

612
00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:03.771
What's going on?

613
00:36:03.771 --> 00:36:05.641
- This isn't a dream, right? - I can't believe it either.

614
00:36:05.641 --> 00:36:08.240
We've never had this many customers before.

615
00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:10.470
I think that baby brings us luck.

616
00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:11.610
I know.

617
00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:14.711
We can pay our water and electricity bills with this.

618
00:36:14.811 --> 00:36:17.981
And at this rate, we'll be able to pay off our loan and shoot a movie.

619
00:36:17.981 --> 00:36:19.380
My gosh. Are you happy?

620
00:36:19.481 --> 00:36:21.220
I thought you wanted to give up.

621
00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:23.050
Well, that's because...

622
00:36:23.951 --> 00:36:26.420
I meant we should give up on giving up.

623
00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:27.860
Move it.

624
00:36:29.431 --> 00:36:30.731
That punk.

625
00:36:32.561 --> 00:36:34.630
My goodness.

626
00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:40.041
Really?

627
00:36:40.041 --> 00:36:42.110
My gosh. Are you in a good mood, my princess?

628
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:45.880
My goodness. Are you that happy?

629
00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:47.411
Must you talk like that?

630
00:36:48.211 --> 00:36:51.650
My goodness. Are you disturbed by the way I talk?

631
00:36:53.050 --> 00:36:55.291
- Cut it out. - Hey, I'm older than you.

632
00:36:56.190 --> 00:36:57.961
Are you angry, Dong Gu?

633
00:36:58.061 --> 00:36:59.860
- My goodness, you're scary. - Stop it.

634
00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:02.860
Let's hide from him. Gosh, he's so evil.

635
00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:05.260
I told you to stop! Stop it already!

636
00:37:07.831 --> 00:37:10.800
Why did you have to yell? You made her cry.

637
00:37:12.771 --> 00:37:14.940
Wait. Do you think she's hungry?

638
00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:17.371
- Where's the formula? - I put it in the kitchen.

639
00:37:18.081 --> 00:37:20.041
Wait here, my princess.

640
00:37:20.041 --> 00:37:21.981
I'll bring you your food.

641
00:37:22.251 --> 00:37:23.351
My gosh.

642
00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:25.581
- Come over here. - Hey, stop.

643
00:37:33.561 --> 00:37:37.431
Do you think her parents really abandoned her?

644
00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:39.800
I can't believe they abandoned that cute baby.

645
00:37:40.161 --> 00:37:42.130
There must be a good reason.

646
00:37:42.601 --> 00:37:44.170
What if they never come back?

647
00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:45.740
Then we can just raise her.

648
00:37:46.070 --> 00:37:47.541
Didn't you see her bring all those customers?

649
00:37:47.541 --> 00:37:49.470
I'm actually worried that her mom might come look for her.

650
00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:52.211
Gosh, that's nonsense. How can we raise her?

651
00:37:52.211 --> 00:37:54.240
Whatever. Let's think about that later.

652
00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:56.510
It's time to feed our princess.

653
00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:00.751
- My gosh. - It's time to eat...

654
00:38:01.951 --> 00:38:03.050
Where did she go?

655
00:38:03.851 --> 00:38:06.521
Hey, hey. Where are you taking her?

656
00:38:06.521 --> 00:38:08.431
What? What's going on?

657
00:38:13.389 --> 00:38:15.459
Hey, stop!

658
00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:18.970
Stop!

659
00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:20.769
Get him!

660
00:38:43.659 --> 00:38:45.860
Hey! Stop right there!

661
00:38:46.229 --> 00:38:48.459
- Come here! - It's a thief!

662
00:38:48.729 --> 00:38:50.360
- Hey! - Stop!

663
00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:51.430
Hey!

664
00:38:54.999 --> 00:38:56.200
Where did he go?

665
00:39:17.289 --> 00:39:18.430
Where is he?

666
00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:19.590
Hey.

667
00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:22.559
- Let's go. - He's leaving.

668
00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:29.170
You're such a fast runner.

669
00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:32.409
You're dead meat. Let me look at you.

670
00:39:35.010 --> 00:39:36.039
Gosh.

671
00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:38.380
Are you hurt?

672
00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:40.550
I'm Lee Jun Ki.

673
00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:44.479
What's your name?

674
00:39:47.889 --> 00:39:50.360
(A Family is Born)

675
00:39:52.059 --> 00:39:53.260
I'm sorry, Sol.

676
00:39:54.329 --> 00:39:56.130
I'm so sorry.

677
00:39:56.599 --> 00:39:59.769
It's my fault. I won't do it again.

678
00:39:59.999 --> 00:40:01.130
I'm sorry.

679
00:40:01.639 --> 00:40:04.200
I'm so sorry, Sol.

680
00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:06.240
Is her name Sol?

681
00:40:07.769 --> 00:40:10.340
Why'd you abandon her if you were going to cry so much?

682
00:40:11.479 --> 00:40:13.680
Isn't that too harsh?

683
00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:15.019
It was hard, wasn't it?

684
00:40:15.119 --> 00:40:16.479
Do you need a shoulder to cry on?

685
00:40:17.479 --> 00:40:19.749
You jerk, how can you in this situation?

686
00:40:19.749 --> 00:40:21.150
What did I do?

687
00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:22.320
That's enough.

688
00:40:22.619 --> 00:40:25.189
Why did you leave the baby?

689
00:40:25.189 --> 00:40:26.360
That's right.

690
00:40:27.930 --> 00:40:29.200
Where's her dad?

691
00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:30.329
Her dad.

692
00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:33.470
Where do you live?

693
00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:34.900
Your house.

694
00:40:36.170 --> 00:40:38.070
Stop crying, and say something.

695
00:40:38.070 --> 00:40:40.769
That way we can take you home, or something.

696
00:40:40.769 --> 00:40:43.740
She must have her reason. Stop cornering her.

697
00:40:47.349 --> 00:40:49.920
I'm very sorry. I'll be leaving now.

698
00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:52.189
Now? Do you have a place to go?

699
00:40:52.619 --> 00:40:55.590
Where would you go with a baby at this hour?

700
00:40:55.619 --> 00:40:57.720
You should sleep here for tonight.

701
00:40:58.130 --> 00:40:59.689
Sleep here? What are you talking about?

702
00:40:59.689 --> 00:41:00.689
We don't have any empty rooms.

703
00:41:00.689 --> 00:41:01.999
Seo Jin's room is empty.

704
00:41:01.999 --> 00:41:04.200
She's at the library, so she'll be home tomorrow.

705
00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:06.599
It's okay. I don't want to cause you any more trouble.

706
00:41:06.599 --> 00:41:09.400
Not at all. It's okay. You should sleep here.

707
00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:12.269
Also, don't worry about this punk.

708
00:41:12.269 --> 00:41:13.939
He just got dumped by his girlfriend,

709
00:41:13.939 --> 00:41:15.639
so he's negative about everything.

710
00:41:15.639 --> 00:41:16.709
Who got dumped?

711
00:41:16.809 --> 00:41:18.749
We have a mutual agreement to break up.

712
00:41:18.849 --> 00:41:20.909
I have no feelings for her anymore.

713
00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:23.849
Why did you bring that up?

714
00:41:26.189 --> 00:41:28.490
Why are you getting upset?

715
00:41:28.490 --> 00:41:30.689
- You jerk. - Stop it.

716
00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:34.700
It's okay. Don't worry about it. Follow me.

717
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:37.400
Stay calm, and go slowly.

718
00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:35.619
I'm so sleepy.

719
00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:38.760
I must sleep. I need to sleep.

720
00:42:40.689 --> 00:42:41.860
I need sleep.

721
00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:56.139
Who are you? Why are you here?

722
00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:57.979
Are you a thief?

723
00:42:57.979 --> 00:42:59.909
No, it's not that. I'm...

724
00:43:00.979 --> 00:43:02.420
What's that?

725
00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:04.849
- There's a fire. - What's going on?

726
00:43:04.849 --> 00:43:05.849
- What's going on? - What happened?

727
00:43:05.849 --> 00:43:07.119
- What happened? - What are you doing?

728
00:43:07.119 --> 00:43:09.789
There's a thief right here.

729
00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:11.789
There's a thief.

730
00:43:12.729 --> 00:43:14.999
Gosh, you startled me for nothing.

731
00:43:14.999 --> 00:43:17.260
She always makes a fuss.

732
00:43:18.099 --> 00:43:20.499
Are you okay, Yoon Ah? Were you startled?

733
00:43:20.499 --> 00:43:22.670
What? Do you know her?

734
00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:25.740
Her name is Yoon Ah. She came to...

735
00:43:26.010 --> 00:43:27.570
You look good.

736
00:43:27.939 --> 00:43:29.840
You really are a woman.

737
00:43:30.479 --> 00:43:32.510
What did you say?

738
00:43:32.809 --> 00:43:35.019
Get out. Get out now.

739
00:43:39.090 --> 00:43:40.789
Oh, I see.

740
00:43:40.789 --> 00:43:43.189
You should have called me.

741
00:43:43.189 --> 00:43:44.659
I don't think...

742
00:43:44.659 --> 00:43:46.689
to call each other about these things.

743
00:43:47.389 --> 00:43:49.959
- You're right. - I'm sorry. It's my fault.

744
00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:52.729
No, I'm sorry for the misunderstanding.

745
00:43:52.729 --> 00:43:56.300
It's late, so you should share your bed tonight with Yoon Ah.

746
00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:58.539
- Share my bed? - Then should she sleep in my bed?

747
00:43:58.809 --> 00:44:01.510
Don't you know that I can't sleep with others?

748
00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:04.010
I said no, but the other two insisted on it.

749
00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:05.510
There are other rooms.

750
00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:07.550
They're occupied with guests. We have no empty room.

751
00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:09.420
All the rooms are occupied? How?

752
00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:11.119
It's a long story. It just happened.

753
00:44:11.119 --> 00:44:12.519
Just bear it, and share your bed.

754
00:44:12.519 --> 00:44:15.559
How can I sleep with a woman I don't know?

755
00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:17.659
Stop being fussy.

756
00:44:17.659 --> 00:44:19.130
Sleep on the ground then.

757
00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:21.159
You woke everyone up at this hour.

758
00:44:21.459 --> 00:44:22.459
You put this back.

759
00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:25.530
Sleep in your room.

760
00:44:25.530 --> 00:44:27.530
Let's go. Give this to me.

761
00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:30.939
- Gosh. - You should sleep in your room.

762
00:45:07.010 --> 00:45:08.079
What's going on?

763
00:45:10.439 --> 00:45:12.479
Were you uncomfortable? Why didn't you wake me up?

764
00:45:12.550 --> 00:45:14.749
You were sleeping so deeply.

765
00:45:14.749 --> 00:45:18.189
I'm sorry. I have bad sleeping habits.

766
00:45:18.619 --> 00:45:21.289
Did I do something wrong?

767
00:45:21.289 --> 00:45:23.990
No. You only farted a few times.

768
00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:25.459
It didn't smell that bad.

769
00:45:37.269 --> 00:45:38.740
Here's your breakfast.

770
00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:40.639
- Thank you. - Goodness.

771
00:45:41.139 --> 00:45:43.780
The toast is bleeding.

772
00:45:45.849 --> 00:45:46.849
Cover your mouth.

773
00:45:46.849 --> 00:45:48.780
We have guests here.

774
00:45:49.650 --> 00:45:52.249
- It was uncomfortable to sleep. - How so?

775
00:45:52.249 --> 00:45:55.220
It's not comfortable to share a bed with a stranger.

776
00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:56.920
When I fall asleep, the baby cries.

777
00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:58.829
Then the mother snores.

778
00:45:59.059 --> 00:46:02.229
She has a knack for making people uncomfortable.

779
00:46:02.229 --> 00:46:03.329
On top of that...

780
00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:05.030
What?

781
00:46:11.639 --> 00:46:13.740
Thank you for last night.

782
00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:14.780
I'll get going now.

783
00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:17.139
You said you have no place to go. You can stay longer.

784
00:46:17.139 --> 00:46:18.180
What do you mean?

785
00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:19.550
She has no place to go.

786
00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:20.979
You have so heartless.

787
00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:23.579
I don't want to bother you more.

788
00:46:23.579 --> 00:46:25.389
Have some breakfast at least.

789
00:46:25.389 --> 00:46:28.360
It's okay. I'm not hungry at all...

790
00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:32.389
Goodness.

791
00:46:32.389 --> 00:46:33.490
Have a seat. I'll make one for you.

792
00:46:33.490 --> 00:46:35.729
Gosh, she's a mess.

793
00:46:51.979 --> 00:46:53.579
Eat slowly.

794
00:46:53.909 --> 00:46:55.550
Have some milk as well.

795
00:46:56.220 --> 00:46:59.320
Du Shik is taking care of the baby, so don't worry.

796
00:46:59.849 --> 00:47:01.150
I'll bring you some more.

797
00:47:05.689 --> 00:47:06.860
What should I do?

798
00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:08.329
Why is she crying?

799
00:47:08.329 --> 00:47:11.200
She suddenly started to cry. I can't make her stop.

800
00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:13.200
Look at the time.

801
00:47:14.229 --> 00:47:15.570
Thank you.

802
00:47:15.639 --> 00:47:18.840
Were you hungry, Sol? I'm sorry.

803
00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:20.439
Let me feed you.

804
00:47:24.139 --> 00:47:25.479
Two more toasts.

805
00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:30.920
- That startled me. - What's going on?

806
00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:32.119
- What? - What did you see?

807
00:47:32.119 --> 00:47:33.320
- Did you see it? - No.

808
00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:36.189
I told you that she makes people uncomfortable.

809
00:47:38.930 --> 00:47:41.059
What's going on? That's strange.

810
00:47:41.729 --> 00:47:43.229
What's wrong?

811
00:47:43.229 --> 00:47:45.670
She can't suck on the milk.

812
00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:47.800
Shall I make some baby formula?

813
00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:50.499
No, she has a weak immune system.

814
00:47:50.499 --> 00:47:52.769
I have to breastfeed her until she's a year old.

815
00:47:54.039 --> 00:47:55.610
Do I have to pump my breast milk?

816
00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:57.139
Pump?

817
00:47:57.740 --> 00:47:59.610
I don't have a breast pump. I'm in trouble.

818
00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:01.010
- What's a breast pump? - Do you know?

819
00:48:01.010 --> 00:48:02.180
- What's a breast pump? - How would I know?

820
00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:03.920
- Ask her. - Yoon Ah.

821
00:48:04.349 --> 00:48:05.920
What's a breast pump?

822
00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:07.550
It's...

823
00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:09.959
a machine to pump breast milk.

824
00:48:09.959 --> 00:48:13.189
We pump the breast milk when the baby can't suck.

825
00:48:13.559 --> 00:48:16.599
Where can we find a breast pump?

826
00:48:16.599 --> 00:48:17.930
Let me think.

827
00:48:18.229 --> 00:48:20.030
They sell it at baby stores,

828
00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:23.139
but they're quite expensive.

829
00:48:23.139 --> 00:48:24.400
I don't have money.

830
00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:26.070
Fine, we'll buy one for you.

831
00:48:26.070 --> 00:48:29.639
Please don't move.

832
00:48:30.539 --> 00:48:31.880
- I'll go. - I'll go with you.

833
00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:33.809
I have a part-time job. Let's go.

834
00:48:33.809 --> 00:48:35.150
Goodness.

835
00:48:35.650 --> 00:48:38.189
Guys, please take me with you.

836
00:48:38.189 --> 00:48:39.889
We have guests. You can't leave.

837
00:48:39.889 --> 00:48:41.420
- Stay at home. - Right.

838
00:48:41.689 --> 00:48:43.459
- I'm sorry. - No.

839
00:48:43.459 --> 00:48:44.889
I'm not comfortable with her.

840
00:48:44.889 --> 00:48:46.030
Please take me.

841
00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:47.329
I'm begging you to just stay here.

842
00:48:47.329 --> 00:48:48.800
Jun Ki!

843
00:48:58.139 --> 00:49:01.170
When women become mothers, they only care about their babies.

844
00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:03.780
She revealed her breast in front of men.

845
00:49:05.349 --> 00:49:06.579
I was so startled.

846
00:49:06.809 --> 00:49:08.019
I know.

847
00:49:09.050 --> 00:49:10.820
There are so many things here.

848
00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:13.349
What does a breast pump look like?

849
00:49:14.619 --> 00:49:15.789
They sell clothes too.

850
00:49:18.229 --> 00:49:20.289
What? It opens.

851
00:49:20.389 --> 00:49:21.999
Why is it...

852
00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:26.530
Hello.

853
00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:29.670
The item that you're looking at is a breastfeeding outfit.

854
00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:32.769
What is it? When you go out with your cute baby,

855
00:49:32.769 --> 00:49:35.380
the baby may cry because she's hungry.

856
00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:39.110
It's awkward to breastfeed because too many people are around.

857
00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:41.150
Do not worry.

858
00:49:41.150 --> 00:49:44.519
Undo the zipper, and take out your breast.

859
00:49:44.519 --> 00:49:48.260
Then you can breastfeed while completely hiding your breast.

860
00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:51.729
In other words, it's called a breast pocket.

861
00:49:52.590 --> 00:49:53.860
A breast...

862
00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:55.700
A breast pocket?

863
00:49:57.229 --> 00:49:58.630
There are many interesting items.

864
00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:01.740
What's this?

865
00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:04.039
Hello.

866
00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:07.709
The item that you're looking at is called breastfeeding pad.

867
00:50:07.709 --> 00:50:08.880
What is a breastfeeding pad?

868
00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:11.209
While sucking from the mother's breast,

869
00:50:11.209 --> 00:50:13.349
the baby gets full. What would he do?

870
00:50:13.349 --> 00:50:15.320
He pulls away from her nipple.

871
00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:17.280
What would happen to the mother?

872
00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:22.260
The breast milk will squirt out like a fountain.

873
00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:25.360
If you stick a breastfeeding pad,

874
00:50:25.959 --> 00:50:27.630
you can rest assured.

875
00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:32.930
In other words, it's a cover for your breast milk.

876
00:50:38.970 --> 00:50:42.340
Are you looking for something in particular?

877
00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:44.709
I'm here to buy a breast pump.

878
00:51:00.659 --> 00:51:02.860
Gosh, this is extremely awkward.

879
00:51:02.959 --> 00:51:05.329
I must say something. Say something.

880
00:51:08.570 --> 00:51:11.039
The baby's eyebrows are so thick.

881
00:51:11.610 --> 00:51:13.539
Look at the plump cheeks.

882
00:51:13.539 --> 00:51:15.610
He's a warrior and a prince.

883
00:51:15.610 --> 00:51:16.709
It's a daughter.

884
00:51:18.209 --> 00:51:19.280
I see.

885
00:51:19.550 --> 00:51:21.820
I thought so. She seemed boyish.

886
00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:23.950
The tomboy look is popular these days.

887
00:51:23.950 --> 00:51:25.920
Her dad must adore her.

888
00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:27.019
We broke up.

889
00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:30.990
I see.

890
00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:35.400
Being a single mom isn't bad.

891
00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:36.459
Who cares if there's no dad?

892
00:51:36.459 --> 00:51:39.130
Her grandparents can love her twice as much.

893
00:51:39.130 --> 00:51:41.740
Both of them passed away.

894
00:51:42.570 --> 00:51:43.740
When I was two,

895
00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:46.570
they died in a fire.

896
00:51:55.650 --> 00:51:58.550
Come back now. Hurry.

897
00:52:00.289 --> 00:52:05.189
There's a manual breast pump and an automatic breast pump.

898
00:52:05.289 --> 00:52:08.459
For a manual breast pump, attach the funnel...

899
00:52:08.459 --> 00:52:10.630
on the breast.

900
00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:12.999
Pull the handle.

901
00:52:16.769 --> 00:52:19.340
This is how you milk the breast.

902
00:52:19.340 --> 00:52:22.610
For an automatic breast pump, press the on button.

903
00:52:22.610 --> 00:52:24.610
From 40 to 50 in a minute...

904
00:52:32.050 --> 00:52:35.519
Please stop. Give us either one, and stop explaining.

905
00:52:35.590 --> 00:52:37.220
I beg you. Please.

906
00:52:39.789 --> 00:52:42.459
The culture shock was equivalent to a natural disaster.

907
00:52:43.059 --> 00:52:45.499
- Right? - Yes.

908
00:52:46.499 --> 00:52:49.369
Shall we take some medicine to calm down?

909
00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:51.309
Okay.

910
00:52:51.970 --> 00:52:54.680
Hey, isn't that Soo Ah?

911
00:52:56.510 --> 00:52:57.709
Dong Gu, there's Soo Ah...

912
00:52:59.709 --> 00:53:01.650
Dong Gu?

913
00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:04.519
What are you doing over there?

914
00:53:05.619 --> 00:53:08.720
What? There's a pillar.

915
00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:10.820
It's very strong.

916
00:53:11.090 --> 00:53:14.289
Of course pillars are strong. They aren't soft.

917
00:53:15.229 --> 00:53:17.159
Did you...

918
00:53:17.499 --> 00:53:19.499
- Soo Ah. - What's going on?

919
00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:22.369
Stop it. What's wrong?

920
00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:25.139
- Stop it. - Gosh, Dong Gu.

921
00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:29.010
If you still have feelings for her, go and beg her to come back.

922
00:53:29.010 --> 00:53:31.479
I didn't do anything wrong. Why would I kneel?

923
00:53:31.479 --> 00:53:33.909
Getting caught trying to sell your ring isn't something to brag about.

924
00:53:34.010 --> 00:53:35.579
Well, that's...

925
00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:38.019
I told you not to bring it up.

926
00:53:38.990 --> 00:53:40.990
I can see that you have regrets.

927
00:53:40.990 --> 00:53:42.889
That's not true.

928
00:53:44.490 --> 00:53:47.260
Fine, stay proud.

929
00:53:47.260 --> 00:53:49.630
Live all your life in regrets.

930
00:53:49.630 --> 00:53:50.959
Soo Ah went this way.

931
00:53:50.959 --> 00:53:53.070
I'm going this way too. I'm leaving.

932
00:53:53.070 --> 00:53:55.400
- Stay here. - Wait for me.

933
00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:56.570
Go after she leaves.

934
00:54:21.700 --> 00:54:22.860
I don't know anymore.

935
00:54:23.360 --> 00:54:24.930
What's the point of staying proud?

936
00:54:25.269 --> 00:54:26.999
Fine, I'll kneel.

937
00:54:27.499 --> 00:54:29.300
It's better than living in regrets.

938
00:54:40.150 --> 00:54:41.920
Excuse me, Soo...

939
00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:43.019
Soo Ah.

940
00:54:44.550 --> 00:54:47.019
Yoon Seok, why are you so late?

941
00:54:47.090 --> 00:54:50.559
I'm sorry. To apologize, I'll buy you some delicious pasta.

942
00:54:51.289 --> 00:54:52.360
Let's go.

943
00:54:55.930 --> 00:54:57.760
- What's wrong with him? - What?

944
00:54:58.229 --> 00:55:00.729
He suddenly fell down. Wait.

945
00:55:02.670 --> 00:55:03.970
Are you okay?

946
00:55:05.939 --> 00:55:07.110
Are you sick?

947
00:55:08.709 --> 00:55:09.809
Excuse me?

948
00:55:12.249 --> 00:55:13.349
Excuse me?

949
00:55:13.950 --> 00:55:15.220
Can you lift your face?

950
00:55:15.619 --> 00:55:16.680
- No. - Sir?

951
00:55:17.450 --> 00:55:18.590
Are you okay?

952
00:55:20.349 --> 00:55:22.090
Jun Ki.

953
00:55:23.590 --> 00:55:25.229
Why did you come so late?

954
00:55:25.229 --> 00:55:26.860
What are you doing? I can't breathe, you wench.

955
00:55:27.659 --> 00:55:29.329
It was so awkward.

956
00:55:29.329 --> 00:55:31.930
I thought I was losing my mind while looking for this.

957
00:55:31.930 --> 00:55:33.829
Did something happen?

958
00:55:33.829 --> 00:55:36.170
I don't know. Don't ask. I don't want to think.

959
00:55:36.170 --> 00:55:37.800
- I told you... - Be quiet. Move.

960
00:55:38.539 --> 00:55:39.639
Move.

961
00:55:40.970 --> 00:55:42.680
I brought you a breast pump, Yoon Ah.

962
00:55:43.209 --> 00:55:45.550
Thank you. I'm sorry for bothering you.

963
00:55:45.749 --> 00:55:49.119
Not at all. Sol must be hungry. You should feed her.

964
00:55:49.579 --> 00:55:51.450
Sol, weren't you hungry?

965
00:55:51.450 --> 00:55:52.920
Let's eat.

966
00:55:54.220 --> 00:55:55.389
Let's see.

967
00:55:55.389 --> 00:55:56.760
This is how it looks.

968
00:55:59.490 --> 00:56:00.590
Goodness.

969
00:56:02.959 --> 00:56:05.630
- What's wrong with her? - I told you.

970
00:56:05.630 --> 00:56:07.269
She makes people uncomfortable.

971
00:56:09.869 --> 00:56:10.999
What's going on?

972
00:56:11.209 --> 00:56:13.809
What's wrong this time?

973
00:56:13.809 --> 00:56:15.380
I can't get any breast milk.

974
00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:19.010
- The mammary glands are clogged. - Mammary glands?

975
00:56:19.550 --> 00:56:21.780
What's that?

976
00:56:21.780 --> 00:56:24.590
They're glands that secrete milk.

977
00:56:24.590 --> 00:56:26.119
I think they're clogged.

978
00:56:26.119 --> 00:56:27.889
What should we do to fix it?

979
00:56:27.889 --> 00:56:30.159
They can be unclogged with a massage.

980
00:56:30.490 --> 00:56:32.930
Calling a massage therapist is costly.

981
00:56:32.930 --> 00:56:35.729
I'll take out a loan to bring one.

982
00:56:35.729 --> 00:56:38.200
Please don't move. I beg you.

983
00:56:42.099 --> 00:56:44.809
Pardon? It's 100 dollars per massage?

984
00:56:45.369 --> 00:56:46.909
It really is expensive.

985
00:56:47.039 --> 00:56:48.510
Can you come immediately?

986
00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:51.450
What? That's not possible.

987
00:56:52.450 --> 00:56:54.749
- Okay. - They can't come?

988
00:56:54.749 --> 00:56:57.349
Due to reservations, it's only possible after a week.

989
00:56:58.119 --> 00:56:59.249
What should we do?

990
00:56:59.249 --> 00:57:00.619
It can't be helped.

991
00:57:03.459 --> 00:57:06.360
- What's wrong? - They hurt because they're swollen.

992
00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:07.490
We're in trouble.

993
00:57:11.329 --> 00:57:14.170
What? Why are you looking at me?

994
00:57:14.170 --> 00:57:15.499
- You do it. - What?

995
00:57:15.939 --> 00:57:17.740
- Do what? - Massage.

996
00:57:18.039 --> 00:57:19.309
Give her a massage.

997
00:57:19.470 --> 00:57:21.579
All you have to do is squeeze them.

998
00:57:21.579 --> 00:57:22.709
Are you crazy?

999
00:57:22.709 --> 00:57:24.880
How can I massage a stranger's breasts?

1000
00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:26.849
Should I do it? Sure I want to.

1001
00:57:26.849 --> 00:57:28.450
If I could learn it now, I would want a career in it.

1002
00:57:28.450 --> 00:57:30.249
Shall I close my eyes and do it myself?

1003
00:57:30.249 --> 00:57:32.820
- You're out of your mind. - So you do it.

1004
00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:35.619
Don't you feel bad for her? She's in pain.

1005
00:57:35.619 --> 00:57:36.720
It hurts.

1006
00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:38.490
I feel bad for her, but...

1007
00:57:38.659 --> 00:57:41.700
Even still, how can I touch her breasts?

1008
00:57:42.700 --> 00:57:44.459
It's okay, I'm fine...

1009
00:57:47.130 --> 00:57:48.200
It hurts.

1010
00:57:51.769 --> 00:57:53.869
I'm about to lose my mind.

1011
00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:57.340
Are you losing your mind?

1012
00:58:02.619 --> 00:58:04.479
Sir, are you okay?

1013
00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:07.689
This is driving me crazy.

1014
00:58:07.749 --> 00:58:10.519
Please leave. Leave, you jerk.

1015
00:58:10.619 --> 00:58:12.829
Yoon Seok, let's go.

1016
00:58:13.930 --> 00:58:15.200
How could we?

1017
00:58:15.430 --> 00:58:17.459
We can't leave someone in pain.

1018
00:58:17.729 --> 00:58:21.740
Just leave. Leave me alone, you jerk.

1019
00:58:25.470 --> 00:58:26.570
We're over here.

1020
00:58:30.110 --> 00:58:31.139
Did you make a report?

1021
00:58:31.139 --> 00:58:34.079
He fell down, and he can't get up.

1022
00:58:34.079 --> 00:58:36.280
I think he hurt his face.

1023
00:58:36.349 --> 00:58:37.479
Is that so?

1024
00:58:39.220 --> 00:58:41.420
Sir, do you hear me?

1025
00:58:41.619 --> 00:58:42.820
Try to stand up.

1026
00:58:44.889 --> 00:58:47.490
This isn't possible. We have to force him up.

1027
00:58:47.689 --> 00:58:48.800
Gather around.

1028
00:58:49.059 --> 00:58:51.159
- Ready? In 1, 2. - In 1, 2.

1029
00:58:54.900 --> 00:58:57.039
Sir, you need to loosen up. Let's try again.

1030
00:58:57.039 --> 00:58:59.039
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

1031
00:59:02.280 --> 00:59:03.409
He's so stiff.

1032
00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:04.950
Call a bigger hospital for help.

1033
00:59:04.950 --> 00:59:06.680
Just a second.

1034
00:59:07.249 --> 00:59:10.119
Okay, I'll get up.

1035
00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:11.820
Are you okay now?

1036
00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:15.659
It'll be so embarrassing if I get caught.

1037
00:59:16.119 --> 00:59:17.289
I'll just have to take my risk.

1038
00:59:48.590 --> 00:59:49.619
Sir.

1039
00:59:53.059 --> 00:59:54.229
Are you okay?

1040
00:59:55.659 --> 00:59:58.570
My gosh, he must've hurt his head as well.

1041
01:00:35.907 --> 01:00:36.907
I'll...

1042
01:00:37.447 --> 01:00:38.876
begin now.

1043
01:00:43.316 --> 01:00:44.586
I'm so tired.

1044
01:00:45.557 --> 01:00:47.816
I wonder when I'll be able to stop working part-time jobs.

1045
01:00:49.126 --> 01:00:50.157
My gosh.

1046
01:00:50.686 --> 01:00:52.626
I'm probably the only CEO that needs to work a part-time job,

1047
01:00:52.626 --> 01:00:54.356
so he can pay his bills on time.

1048
01:00:59.867 --> 01:01:00.896
What's this?

1049
01:01:06.936 --> 01:01:08.247
How did it go?

1050
01:01:09.506 --> 01:01:11.347
My gosh, this is incredible.

1051
01:01:11.347 --> 01:01:14.316
My goodness. My gosh.

1052
01:01:19.256 --> 01:01:21.356
How did it go? Did you succeed?

1053
01:01:22.227 --> 01:01:23.356
Can't you see?

1054
01:01:23.756 --> 01:01:25.827
I thought I hit an oil well.

1055
01:01:26.697 --> 01:01:27.697
What a relief.

1056
01:01:28.396 --> 01:01:31.597
Good job. I'm so proud of you.

1057
01:01:31.896 --> 01:01:34.197
Be quiet. Where's the breast pump?

1058
01:01:34.197 --> 01:01:35.436
She wants it now.

1059
01:01:35.436 --> 01:01:37.666
The breast pump? I put it...

1060
01:01:39.706 --> 01:01:41.177
By the way, is she older than you?

1061
01:01:41.706 --> 01:01:43.706
Based on looks, I thought you were much older.

1062
01:01:43.706 --> 01:01:44.717
What?

1063
01:01:44.776 --> 01:01:47.316
I've been too easy on you lately, haven't I?

1064
01:01:47.376 --> 01:01:49.247
Gosh, I was just kidding.

1065
01:01:49.247 --> 01:01:50.247
Sure you were.

1066
01:01:50.247 --> 01:01:51.356
- It was a joke. - Come over here.

1067
01:01:51.356 --> 01:01:54.557
- I was just kidding. It was a joke. - You deserve a beating.

1068
01:01:55.626 --> 01:01:57.227
This feels nice.

1069
01:02:00.427 --> 01:02:01.467
Get off.

1070
01:02:01.927 --> 01:02:03.767
- Hey! - You startled me.

1071
01:02:03.767 --> 01:02:05.597
What do you think you're doing?

1072
01:02:05.597 --> 01:02:07.666
- What? What did I do? - What did you do?

1073
01:02:08.066 --> 01:02:10.767
What did you do?

1074
01:02:10.767 --> 01:02:13.106
Do you even know what this is?

1075
01:02:13.106 --> 01:02:14.907
Why did you hit me? Isn't this a massager?

1076
01:02:14.907 --> 01:02:16.046
It's not a massager.

1077
01:02:16.046 --> 01:02:19.077
You jerk. This is for squeezing... You jerk!

1078
01:02:19.077 --> 01:02:20.646
It feels really nice. You should try it.

1079
01:02:20.646 --> 01:02:23.086
What? You little jerk. How could you...

1080
01:02:23.617 --> 01:02:26.057
You stupid punk. Do you know how expensive this is?

1081
01:02:26.186 --> 01:02:27.217
You jerk!

1082
01:02:27.356 --> 01:02:28.756
(Waikiki Guesthouse and Hostel)

1083
01:02:29.086 --> 01:02:30.427
You're the one who needs to better. Just you.

1084
01:02:30.427 --> 01:02:31.456
He's right.

1085
01:02:33.497 --> 01:02:35.566
Dong Gu, what's wrong with you? Did something happen?

1086
01:02:35.566 --> 01:02:37.566
Don't ask me anything.

1087
01:02:41.307 --> 01:02:44.637
Why is it so quiet here? Where are the customers?

1088
01:02:44.637 --> 01:02:47.276
They're having a party on the rooftop.

1089
01:02:47.276 --> 01:02:49.506
They went crazy over grilled pork.

1090
01:02:50.046 --> 01:02:51.916
- Really? Good. - Yes.

1091
01:02:54.046 --> 01:02:55.916
What about the woman and her baby? Did they leave?

1092
01:02:55.916 --> 01:02:59.517
What? Yes, they left.

1093
01:02:59.986 --> 01:03:01.986
Okay, that's good.

1094
01:03:02.586 --> 01:03:06.227
But doesn't the house feel empty now that it's quiet?

1095
01:03:07.126 --> 01:03:08.166
I wonder how she's doing.

1096
01:03:08.166 --> 01:03:09.467
I'm worried. She said she has nowhere to go.

1097
01:03:09.467 --> 01:03:11.336
- I'm so worried. - Right, Jun Ki?

1098
01:03:11.336 --> 01:03:13.467
Me too. We could've let her stay here.

1099
01:03:13.467 --> 01:03:16.236
You're worried too, aren't you?

1100
01:03:16.236 --> 01:03:17.307
What?

1101
01:03:17.767 --> 01:03:19.936
You're being suspicious. What's going on?

1102
01:03:20.006 --> 01:03:23.146
You're hiding something from me, aren't you?

1103
01:03:23.146 --> 01:03:24.816
My gosh, what are you talking about?

1104
01:03:24.816 --> 01:03:26.247
We're not hiding anything.

1105
01:03:26.247 --> 01:03:28.347
- Can't you trust anyone? - Exactly.

1106
01:03:34.217 --> 01:03:37.526
What? Isn't that a baby crying?

1107
01:03:37.856 --> 01:03:39.557
What sound? I didn't hear anything.

1108
01:03:39.557 --> 01:03:42.097
- Me neither. - I didn't hear anything either.

1109
01:03:45.137 --> 01:03:46.436
Seo Jin.

1110
01:03:46.436 --> 01:03:48.767
I think my milk ducts are clogged again. What should I do?

1111
01:03:52.106 --> 01:03:54.606
Why is she still here?

1112
01:03:54.606 --> 01:03:56.247
I thought she left.

1113
01:03:56.247 --> 01:03:57.977
Who? Her?

1114
01:03:57.977 --> 01:04:00.617
She's not Yoon Ha. She's someone else.

1115
01:04:00.617 --> 01:04:02.517
Okay, In Sun. We'll be right there.

1116
01:04:03.347 --> 01:04:05.416
Oh, really? Okay.

1117
01:04:05.916 --> 01:04:08.827
Do you think I'm a fool? Why are you doing this?

1118
01:04:09.057 --> 01:04:11.896
Hey, hey. Stop it. Hey!

1119
01:04:12.256 --> 01:04:13.997
Don't you feel sorry for her?

1120
01:04:13.997 --> 01:04:16.296
We may not have money, but we have compassion.

1121
01:04:16.296 --> 01:04:17.367
I don't have either.

1122
01:04:17.626 --> 01:04:19.497
- Hey, hey! - Dong Gu.

1123
01:04:19.497 --> 01:04:21.436
- Let me go! - Come on, Dong Gu.

1124
01:04:22.006 --> 01:04:23.336
- Let go of me. - Hey.

1125
01:04:23.336 --> 01:04:25.037
I can't believe this. What's this?

1126
01:04:25.037 --> 01:04:28.247
Come on. She has nowhere to go. Let's let her stay here.

1127
01:04:28.247 --> 01:04:31.177
- Hey. - Yoon Ah, go back inside.

1128
01:04:31.177 --> 01:04:33.876
- Let me go. - Go back inside.

1129
01:05:04.307 --> 01:05:07.447
(Welcome to Waikiki)

1130
01:05:07.776 --> 01:05:09.046
She's definitely the type...

1131
01:05:09.046 --> 01:05:10.747
that will get herself into big trouble.

1132
01:05:11.416 --> 01:05:12.456
My gosh.

1133
01:05:12.717 --> 01:05:13.787
Oh, gosh.

1134
01:05:14.517 --> 01:05:16.927
- My goodness. - I don't like her.

1135
01:05:17.026 --> 01:05:18.026
I really don't like her.

1136
01:05:18.026 --> 01:05:19.157
Please buy me this.

1137
01:05:19.157 --> 01:05:21.126
- Who's this? - What? She's my girlfriend.

1138
01:05:21.126 --> 01:05:22.296
Girlfriend?

1139
01:05:22.296 --> 01:05:25.767
It's a Korean version of "X-Men". I'm sure it's going to be popular.

1140
01:05:25.867 --> 01:05:28.666
I'm going to get rid of your part if you mess up your makeup.

1141
01:05:28.666 --> 01:05:29.967
You little jerk!

1142
01:05:29.967 --> 01:05:31.006
My gosh!

1143
01:05:31.006 --> 01:05:32.006
- Freeze! - What's that?

1144
01:05:32.006 --> 01:05:34.977
You really make your life tough on yourself.

1145
01:05:34.977 --> 01:05:36.247
- Are you Chewbacca? - Seo Jin.

1146
01:05:36.247 --> 01:05:37.276
Yoon Ah.

1147
01:05:37.376 --> 01:05:40.416
My hair grows only a couple hours after I shave.

1148
01:05:41.387 --> 01:05:43.416
Hey, you're killing me here!

1149
01:05:43.416 --> 01:05:45.057
Did you use this mushroom to cook the stew?

1150
01:05:45.057 --> 01:05:47.617
- Everyone's sick because of... - I'm sorry.

1151
01:05:47.617 --> 01:05:50.456
I can't let go of this anymore, so please pack up and leave.

1152
01:05:51.026 --> 01:05:52.927
What are you doing?

1153
01:05:53.756 --> 01:05:54.796
Soo Ah.
