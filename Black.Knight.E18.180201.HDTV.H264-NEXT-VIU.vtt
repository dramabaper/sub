00:00:08.447 --> 00:00:10.287
(Episode 18)

2
00:00:30.445 --> 00:00:31.485
Really?

3
00:00:32.316 --> 00:00:33.786
Did your life change...

4
00:00:33.786 --> 00:00:35.725
after you put this on?

5
00:00:37.525 --> 00:00:38.525
Yes.

6
00:00:40.025 --> 00:00:41.496
I'm thankful for the coat,

7
00:00:43.265 --> 00:00:44.896
but I'm also scared of it.

8
00:01:03.886 --> 00:01:05.586
Yes, dark brown.

9
00:01:06.386 --> 00:01:07.386
Seung Goo.

10
00:01:07.485 --> 00:01:08.586
I'm leaving.

11
00:01:09.386 --> 00:01:10.455
One second.

12
00:01:10.785 --> 00:01:12.285
Have a cup of tea before you leave.

13
00:01:13.595 --> 00:01:15.155
Then I'll tell Soo Ho to come here.

14
00:01:15.155 --> 00:01:16.565
We have to be somewhere later.

15
00:01:16.996 --> 00:01:18.226
That'd be wonderful.

16
00:01:19.395 --> 00:01:20.696
Yes. Hello?

17
00:01:45.726 --> 00:01:48.455
Who are you?

18
00:02:09.085 --> 00:02:10.685
Sharon.

19
00:02:12.015 --> 00:02:13.256
Seung Goo.

20
00:02:14.156 --> 00:02:15.925
Seung Goo, you're alive.

21
00:02:17.226 --> 00:02:19.455
Where have you been?

22
00:02:19.455 --> 00:02:21.356
Seung Goo, you're still alive.

23
00:02:22.666 --> 00:02:24.196
You haven't aged at all.

24
00:02:25.196 --> 00:02:27.495
By the way, why do you look so shabby?

25
00:02:28.796 --> 00:02:30.136
Did you fall or something?

26
00:02:33.006 --> 00:02:34.506
Is she our customer?

27
00:02:37.576 --> 00:02:39.275
She's Ms. Jung Hae Ra.

28
00:02:40.175 --> 00:02:41.816
I'll go tell Baek Hee you're back.

29
00:02:41.816 --> 00:02:43.215
Hae Ra, wait here.

30
00:02:47.756 --> 00:02:50.185
I'm glad to serve such a pretty customer.

31
00:02:50.455 --> 00:02:53.055
Please sit down. I'll get changed and come back.

32
00:02:53.055 --> 00:02:54.055
Excuse me.

33
00:02:56.066 --> 00:02:57.166
Yes?

34
00:02:59.435 --> 00:03:01.066
What happened?

35
00:03:02.666 --> 00:03:03.935
What do you mean?

36
00:03:09.846 --> 00:03:11.705
You jumped into the river.

37
00:03:12.846 --> 00:03:14.275
I probably did...

38
00:03:15.916 --> 00:03:17.346
How do you know?

39
00:03:23.656 --> 00:03:25.995
Seung Goo, let's have tea next time.

40
00:03:36.765 --> 00:03:38.066
We talked.

41
00:03:39.476 --> 00:03:41.636
I don't think she remembers me. No,

42
00:03:42.406 --> 00:03:44.145
I think she's pretending not to know me.

43
00:03:47.515 --> 00:03:49.015
Never go there again,

44
00:03:49.015 --> 00:03:50.316
and ignore her if she contacts you.

45
00:03:52.916 --> 00:03:54.656
What if she comes to our house?

46
00:03:55.156 --> 00:03:56.756
Don't worry. We'll report her.

47
00:03:58.055 --> 00:03:59.156
She never dies...

48
00:04:00.055 --> 00:04:02.666
and lives forever, doesn't she?

49
00:04:05.626 --> 00:04:06.696
Hae Ra.

50
00:04:08.296 --> 00:04:09.735
Let's get married quickly.

51
00:04:11.835 --> 00:04:12.976
Even if we get married,

52
00:04:12.976 --> 00:04:14.935
you won't be inconvenienced,

53
00:04:14.935 --> 00:04:16.445
and nothing will change.

54
00:04:16.445 --> 00:04:17.505
I promise.

55
00:04:20.546 --> 00:04:21.675
Still...

56
00:04:22.646 --> 00:04:25.586
I want to give you a wedding present,

57
00:04:26.555 --> 00:04:28.055
but right now, I'm...

58
00:04:28.185 --> 00:04:29.586
I don't need a present.

59
00:04:29.925 --> 00:04:31.356
All I need is you.

60
00:04:33.695 --> 00:04:35.796
If you trust me, let's just do as I say.

61
00:04:39.365 --> 00:04:40.396
Please?

62
00:04:43.565 --> 00:04:44.935
Okay, I will.

63
00:05:20.906 --> 00:05:22.005
Sharon?

64
00:05:25.106 --> 00:05:26.175
Sharon?

65
00:05:32.016 --> 00:05:33.086
Baek Hee.

66
00:05:40.856 --> 00:05:43.226
I'm happy that you're alive too.

67
00:05:47.096 --> 00:05:48.865
I came back very soon this time, right?

68
00:05:49.266 --> 00:05:50.635
I was surprised.

69
00:05:53.075 --> 00:05:54.635
You seem happy.

70
00:05:56.245 --> 00:05:57.406
You look pretty.

71
00:05:58.005 --> 00:06:00.346
It's good to see you and Seung Goo again.

72
00:06:00.976 --> 00:06:02.885
The shop is still here too.

73
00:06:03.685 --> 00:06:04.985
I'm so happy.

74
00:06:09.156 --> 00:06:11.356
Seung Goo, bring us some tea.

75
00:06:14.925 --> 00:06:17.396
I do not know when she will return,

76
00:06:18.995 --> 00:06:20.096
but when she does,

77
00:06:21.435 --> 00:06:23.235
please let her come back...

78
00:06:24.666 --> 00:06:26.875
without the memory of...

79
00:06:27.106 --> 00:06:28.675
Soo Ho and Hae Ra.

80
00:06:30.906 --> 00:06:33.516
We do not know when her life will end,

81
00:06:35.416 --> 00:06:37.685
but her life would be bearable...

82
00:06:41.055 --> 00:06:43.456
without that memory, wouldn't it?

83
00:06:56.336 --> 00:06:58.065
Hae Ra was here, wasn't she?

84
00:07:02.846 --> 00:07:04.846
A young woman was here.

85
00:07:05.945 --> 00:07:07.546
Do you know her too?

86
00:07:07.675 --> 00:07:09.046
Don't you remember?

87
00:07:10.346 --> 00:07:13.086
Seung Goo got us a new client while I was gone.

88
00:07:15.456 --> 00:07:17.385
She was pretty, and she seemed nice.

89
00:07:18.086 --> 00:07:20.356
If she comes back, I'll make her something pretty.

90
00:07:22.896 --> 00:07:23.995
Then...

91
00:07:25.226 --> 00:07:28.036
can you also make me something for spring?

92
00:07:30.735 --> 00:07:32.235
Let's see.

93
00:07:36.675 --> 00:07:38.745
I just thought of a design.

94
00:07:38.976 --> 00:07:40.146
Wait here.

95
00:07:50.485 --> 00:07:53.055
Seung Goo. What is that coat?

96
00:07:53.896 --> 00:07:55.296
Isn't that Hae Ra's?

97
00:07:58.896 --> 00:08:00.435
She returned it.

98
00:08:00.435 --> 00:08:01.896
She said she enjoyed wearing it.

99
00:08:04.966 --> 00:08:07.875
She said she was thankful, but also scared.

100
00:08:09.776 --> 00:08:12.646
I'll keep that coat for a while.

101
00:08:12.916 --> 00:08:14.445
Please put it in my car.

102
00:08:35.366 --> 00:08:36.805
Let's see.

103
00:08:40.736 --> 00:08:42.705
1pm. 3pm.

104
00:08:43.246 --> 00:08:44.575
Does that work for the wedding photo shoot?

105
00:08:44.575 --> 00:08:46.146
Yes. That's fine.

106
00:08:46.146 --> 00:08:48.075
Then we'll go to work,

107
00:08:48.075 --> 00:08:49.646
have lunch, then meet up.

108
00:08:49.646 --> 00:08:50.845
I'll go pick you up.

109
00:08:50.945 --> 00:08:53.916
Okay. Let's have a home wedding,

110
00:08:53.916 --> 00:08:56.126
and invite only close friends.

111
00:08:57.526 --> 00:08:59.455
But I want to throw you a grand wedding.

112
00:08:59.455 --> 00:09:01.195
That's old fashioned.

113
00:09:01.195 --> 00:09:03.266
Let's have a small, enjoyable wedding.

114
00:09:04.095 --> 00:09:05.166
All right.

115
00:09:05.796 --> 00:09:07.996
How about next Saturday for the wedding?

116
00:09:08.796 --> 00:09:10.036
Okay.

117
00:09:11.335 --> 00:09:13.105
We'll be so busy preparing for the wedding.

118
00:09:14.575 --> 00:09:16.205
We have to go here together.

119
00:09:16.646 --> 00:09:19.276
This one can start at 5pm.

120
00:09:21.616 --> 00:09:23.416
Ms. Jang, are you in there?

121
00:09:26.786 --> 00:09:27.916
Ms. Jang.

122
00:09:28.286 --> 00:09:31.355
What brings you here?

123
00:09:33.325 --> 00:09:35.695
I wanted to invite you first.

124
00:09:35.695 --> 00:09:37.296
Hae Ra and I are getting married next week.

125
00:09:38.296 --> 00:09:39.465
Really?

126
00:09:41.065 --> 00:09:42.636
Congratulations.

127
00:09:43.136 --> 00:09:46.406
I haven't heard such great news in so long.

128
00:09:46.935 --> 00:09:48.736
It'll be a small home wedding.

129
00:09:49.146 --> 00:09:52.246
I want you to be the officiant.

130
00:09:53.876 --> 00:09:57.215
Goodness. How could I?

131
00:09:59.516 --> 00:10:01.715
You can make it simple.

132
00:10:01.715 --> 00:10:03.455
I really want you to be at our wedding.

133
00:10:05.996 --> 00:10:08.296
I can't believe I'll be an officiant at a wedding.

134
00:10:09.126 --> 00:10:11.626
I'm really going to make it simple.

135
00:10:11.626 --> 00:10:12.695
Okay.

136
00:10:23.305 --> 00:10:24.345
Ms. Jang.

137
00:10:25.046 --> 00:10:28.116
Is Choi Seo Rin really back alive?

138
00:10:32.555 --> 00:10:34.786
Thankfully, she doesn't remember you two.

139
00:10:36.986 --> 00:10:39.325
I observed her carefully thinking that...

140
00:10:39.325 --> 00:10:40.796
maybe she was pretending.

141
00:10:41.425 --> 00:10:42.796
But she really doesn't remember.

142
00:10:44.925 --> 00:10:46.666
How long will she live?

143
00:10:49.835 --> 00:10:51.205
One can never know.

144
00:11:02.175 --> 00:11:04.016
Please hold her hand.

145
00:11:04.016 --> 00:11:06.016
Move in a bit closer.

146
00:11:06.016 --> 00:11:07.055
That's great.

147
00:11:07.055 --> 00:11:10.185
Please look at her in the eye.

148
00:11:10.825 --> 00:11:12.526
1, 2, cue.

149
00:11:12.996 --> 00:11:14.725
Okay. 1, 2, 3.

150
00:11:14.725 --> 00:11:17.766
Here we go. 1, 2. Go.

151
00:11:22.296 --> 00:11:24.736
That's great. Please smile more.

152
00:11:24.736 --> 00:11:26.475
1, 2, 3.

153
00:11:26.636 --> 00:11:28.605
Don't be shy. Look at the camera.

154
00:11:28.605 --> 00:11:31.075
1, 2, cue.

155
00:11:43.685 --> 00:11:45.955
Mr. Groom, please smile a bit more.

156
00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:47.695
This is the last shot. One last time.

157
00:11:47.695 --> 00:11:50.325
1, 2, 3, and cue.

158
00:11:50.595 --> 00:11:52.536
- Good job. - How pretty.

159
00:11:52.536 --> 00:11:54.866
Aunt Sook Hee, let's take one together.

160
00:11:55.195 --> 00:11:58.465
Gosh, no. It's fine.

161
00:11:58.565 --> 00:12:00.835
I thought you did your pretty make up for this.

162
00:12:00.835 --> 00:12:03.546
What are you talking about? I'm always pretty.

163
00:12:04.146 --> 00:12:06.215
Is there any dress that she can try on?

164
00:12:06.215 --> 00:12:07.746
Laugh at the count of three.

165
00:12:07.746 --> 00:12:09.046
1, 2, 3.

166
00:12:13.786 --> 00:12:15.116
Here we go.

167
00:12:15.116 --> 00:12:16.685
One last time.

168
00:12:16.685 --> 00:12:18.225
Sir, please hold.

169
00:12:18.555 --> 00:12:19.555
You're here.

170
00:12:19.555 --> 00:12:20.955
Hello.

171
00:12:23.965 --> 00:12:25.835
It's the most beautiful scene...

172
00:12:26.335 --> 00:12:28.435
of my entire life.

173
00:12:30.335 --> 00:12:32.166
What's that?

174
00:12:33.575 --> 00:12:35.205
It's an outfit to ease their grudge.

175
00:12:44.886 --> 00:12:46.156
Don't laugh awkwardly.

176
00:12:46.156 --> 00:12:47.786
Please try posing.

177
00:12:48.455 --> 00:12:51.355
Look over here, and here we go in 1, 2, 3.

178
00:12:52.955 --> 00:12:54.095
Good job.

179
00:12:54.095 --> 00:12:55.656
Let's do a bow this time.

180
00:12:58.595 --> 00:12:59.965
You'll bow at each other.

181
00:13:01.335 --> 00:13:02.465
Face each other.

182
00:13:02.705 --> 00:13:04.366
- For real? - Yes.

183
00:13:05.975 --> 00:13:08.175
- Let's do the bow. - Okay.

184
00:13:08.175 --> 00:13:10.406
1, 2, 3.

185
00:13:10.876 --> 00:13:11.876
Cue.

186
00:14:02.256 --> 00:14:03.266
Now,

187
00:14:04.026 --> 00:14:05.396
everything...

188
00:14:05.965 --> 00:14:07.866
went back to normal.

189
00:14:11.036 --> 00:14:12.435
Shall we take a photo with her?

190
00:14:12.435 --> 00:14:14.075
Ma'am, please take a picture with us.

191
00:14:14.605 --> 00:14:16.345
Let's do it.

192
00:14:16.546 --> 00:14:17.605
Aunt Sook Hee, you too.

193
00:14:18.445 --> 00:14:19.746
- Hurry. - Let's go.

194
00:14:20.075 --> 00:14:21.416
- Come. - Okay.

195
00:14:23.786 --> 00:14:26.016
- Stand here. - No, this is fine.

196
00:14:26.286 --> 00:14:29.526
Look here, and 1, 2, 3.

197
00:14:34.996 --> 00:14:36.126
Hello.

198
00:14:39.736 --> 00:14:41.335
It's been a long time.

199
00:14:41.565 --> 00:14:43.136
Did something happen?

200
00:14:43.305 --> 00:14:44.866
Your shop was often closed.

201
00:14:46.006 --> 00:14:48.475
It wasn't closed all the time.

202
00:14:49.205 --> 00:14:51.105
I guess you visited at a bad timing.

203
00:14:51.445 --> 00:14:52.715
I'll bring you some tea.

204
00:14:53.715 --> 00:14:54.746
Thank you.

205
00:14:57.646 --> 00:14:58.815
How have you been?

206
00:14:59.685 --> 00:15:00.986
You look good.

207
00:15:01.986 --> 00:15:03.626
You're the athlete student, right?

208
00:15:04.355 --> 00:15:05.355
What?

209
00:15:08.595 --> 00:15:10.166
The muscular trainer.

210
00:15:11.526 --> 00:15:12.666
It's not funny.

211
00:15:12.896 --> 00:15:13.896
Stop it.

212
00:15:15.095 --> 00:15:17.236
How do we know each other?

213
00:15:23.345 --> 00:15:24.675
It's a token of my gratitude.

214
00:15:25.916 --> 00:15:28.445
You made me nice clothes.

215
00:15:28.445 --> 00:15:30.616
I made you clothes?

216
00:15:31.715 --> 00:15:34.416
You made me several decent suits.

217
00:15:36.286 --> 00:15:37.986
Right, I remember.

218
00:15:39.626 --> 00:15:41.126
Why did I make you suits?

219
00:15:41.126 --> 00:15:42.425
Did we go out?

220
00:15:43.925 --> 00:15:46.136
You're still off the wall.

221
00:15:48.565 --> 00:15:50.605
How is it going with you and Mr. Moon?

222
00:15:51.705 --> 00:15:52.805
Mr. Moon?

223
00:15:59.646 --> 00:16:00.646
What do you think?

224
00:16:00.646 --> 00:16:02.715
Don't you think the outfit was a nice idea?

225
00:16:02.945 --> 00:16:04.815
Yes, I love it.

226
00:16:10.386 --> 00:16:11.825
You're still in that dress.

227
00:16:12.695 --> 00:16:14.225
I'll get changed already.

228
00:17:02.006 --> 00:17:03.246
Yes, ma'am.

229
00:17:04.276 --> 00:17:05.276
Have a seat.

230
00:17:06.976 --> 00:17:08.615
Did you work out when you were little?

231
00:17:08.946 --> 00:17:10.415
It was quite impressive.

232
00:17:12.615 --> 00:17:14.016
What sport did you do?

233
00:17:14.486 --> 00:17:15.855
I did almost everything.

234
00:17:16.585 --> 00:17:18.226
I especially did a lot of kendo...

235
00:17:18.226 --> 00:17:19.756
to hide the scar on my face.

236
00:17:20.595 --> 00:17:21.696
That's right.

237
00:17:22.565 --> 00:17:24.026
I think I saw you carrying...

238
00:17:24.065 --> 00:17:26.565
a bamboo sword and a mask when you were young.

239
00:17:27.796 --> 00:17:28.895
I have a fifth grade in kendo.

240
00:17:28.895 --> 00:17:30.236
I have an instructor certificate too.

241
00:17:30.236 --> 00:17:31.936
That's cool.

242
00:17:32.936 --> 00:17:34.135
Can you teach me as well?

243
00:17:34.135 --> 00:17:36.546
You don't need to learn how to do it.

244
00:17:36.546 --> 00:17:37.645
Is that right?

245
00:17:40.115 --> 00:17:41.476
When the photos are out,

246
00:17:41.476 --> 00:17:43.315
send me some of them.

247
00:17:44.585 --> 00:17:45.585
Ms. Jang.

248
00:17:47.115 --> 00:17:49.055
Ever since that day,

249
00:17:49.756 --> 00:17:51.085
my condition has gotten much better,

250
00:17:51.085 --> 00:17:52.526
and I feel much stronger too.

251
00:17:52.526 --> 00:17:54.095
It's just my feeling, right?

252
00:18:02.405 --> 00:18:04.365
I'll call you when the photos are out.

253
00:18:04.706 --> 00:18:06.805
Okay.

254
00:18:07.575 --> 00:18:08.776
I'll get you a cup of water.

255
00:18:21.115 --> 00:18:23.085
I guess she's suffered a lot.

256
00:18:23.855 --> 00:18:25.085
Who?

257
00:18:25.085 --> 00:18:26.855
Women are scary.

258
00:18:27.756 --> 00:18:29.325
She was so obsessed with him,

259
00:18:29.365 --> 00:18:30.526
but how could she...

260
00:18:31.726 --> 00:18:33.095
Don't remind her of Mr. Moon...

261
00:18:33.095 --> 00:18:34.496
by talking about him.

262
00:18:38.206 --> 00:18:39.605
I'm so happy with...

263
00:18:40.036 --> 00:18:41.405
how she is right now.

264
00:19:03.726 --> 00:19:05.095
Hi.

265
00:19:06.335 --> 00:19:07.335
Have a seat.

266
00:19:11.365 --> 00:19:12.605
You changed the display.

267
00:19:13.506 --> 00:19:14.776
What do you want to talk about?

268
00:19:18.845 --> 00:19:21.115
I'm getting married with Soo Ho next Saturday.

269
00:19:21.516 --> 00:19:22.516
Really?

270
00:19:23.286 --> 00:19:25.186
We're inviting only those who're close to us.

271
00:19:25.186 --> 00:19:26.415
You will come, right?

272
00:19:26.415 --> 00:19:28.186
Of course, I will.

273
00:19:28.956 --> 00:19:30.355
Congratulations, Hae Ra.

274
00:19:31.526 --> 00:19:34.095
Thank you. Sorry I'm getting married first.

275
00:19:34.325 --> 00:19:36.125
I'll pay a lot of gift money.

276
00:19:36.125 --> 00:19:38.325
I'll give you pretty clothes as gifts too.

277
00:19:40.036 --> 00:19:41.696
Be happy, my friend.

278
00:19:41.966 --> 00:19:43.266
Are you crying?

279
00:19:43.305 --> 00:19:45.165
I mean, you suffered so much,

280
00:19:45.665 --> 00:19:47.405
and I'm glad you met a great guy.

281
00:19:47.405 --> 00:19:50.075
Don't cry like a mom who marries off her daughter.

282
00:19:51.276 --> 00:19:53.375
When I hung out with delinquents,

283
00:19:53.375 --> 00:19:55.546
you slapped my cheek so I'd come to my senses.

284
00:19:55.546 --> 00:19:57.085
You fought with them for me.

285
00:19:58.946 --> 00:20:00.186
Thank you, Hae Ra.

286
00:20:02.256 --> 00:20:05.155
Come on. Don't cry.

287
00:20:05.996 --> 00:20:07.555
I'll see you at the wedding. Come with Gon.

288
00:20:07.555 --> 00:20:08.555
Okay.

289
00:20:09.196 --> 00:20:10.196
Bye.

290
00:20:10.526 --> 00:20:11.595
- Bye. - Bye.

291
00:20:25.476 --> 00:20:27.216
Why are you drinking alone like this?

292
00:20:29.915 --> 00:20:31.216
Hae Ra is getting married...

293
00:20:31.746 --> 00:20:33.256
next weekend at her house.

294
00:20:36.555 --> 00:20:37.655
That's good.

295
00:20:39.825 --> 00:20:40.825
Are we...

296
00:20:41.226 --> 00:20:42.726
even getting married?

297
00:20:43.095 --> 00:20:44.565
Forget it if you don't want to.

298
00:20:46.436 --> 00:20:47.466
No.

299
00:20:48.335 --> 00:20:50.236
I'll keep the secret until the end,

300
00:20:50.466 --> 00:20:52.365
get married with you, and live happily.

301
00:21:03.915 --> 00:21:05.855
They checked if you had a stroke,

302
00:21:05.855 --> 00:21:07.385
but they found nothing unusual.

303
00:21:08.786 --> 00:21:11.585
You had a heart attack due to excessive bleeding.

304
00:21:11.956 --> 00:21:13.325
It's so strange.

305
00:21:15.825 --> 00:21:18.996
No one has shown such a fast recovery.

306
00:21:25.105 --> 00:21:26.236
Sharon...

307
00:21:27.176 --> 00:21:29.246
stabbed you with her knife.

308
00:21:31.375 --> 00:21:33.446
Your pulse was still beating,

309
00:21:35.345 --> 00:21:37.216
so I hid the knife.

310
00:21:39.986 --> 00:21:41.055
That knife.

311
00:21:41.786 --> 00:21:43.256
The knife that's hidden.

312
00:21:46.825 --> 00:21:49.395
Move him to a storage in Changwon.

313
00:21:49.865 --> 00:21:50.865
Yes.

314
00:21:51.726 --> 00:21:54.466
Make sure he gets two meals a day.

315
00:21:55.595 --> 00:21:56.706
Yes.

316
00:22:01.506 --> 00:22:02.676
Dad.

317
00:22:05.875 --> 00:22:07.946
Gosh, you idiot.

318
00:22:07.946 --> 00:22:10.046
I can't believe you're drunk.

319
00:22:11.546 --> 00:22:13.216
My ignorant,

320
00:22:13.986 --> 00:22:15.555
foolish,

321
00:22:16.686 --> 00:22:17.786
and...

322
00:22:20.296 --> 00:22:22.565
And my poor little dad.

323
00:22:25.526 --> 00:22:28.496
If you're drunk, just go and sleep.

324
00:22:28.766 --> 00:22:30.536
Dad, let's stop here.

325
00:22:34.276 --> 00:22:37.706
I can't protect you any longer.

326
00:22:41.115 --> 00:22:44.246
Let's just stop, please!

327
00:22:53.296 --> 00:22:54.625
What are you talking about?

328
00:22:57.226 --> 00:22:58.926
Do you like money that much?

329
00:23:00.365 --> 00:23:02.936
The only thing you can show off is the fact...

330
00:23:03.305 --> 00:23:04.835
that you're a rich man's son.

331
00:23:07.776 --> 00:23:11.476
Without money, you're nothing.

332
00:23:11.476 --> 00:23:12.815
A rich man's son.

333
00:23:18.085 --> 00:23:20.415
Am I not a criminal's son?

334
00:23:24.786 --> 00:23:27.355
Don't worry about that, and go to sleep.

335
00:23:28.456 --> 00:23:29.996
You timid fool.

336
00:23:49.546 --> 00:23:52.145
Good morning. Let's start working out.

337
00:24:02.355 --> 00:24:03.466
Mr. Choi?

338
00:24:04.996 --> 00:24:06.065
One second.

339
00:24:07.135 --> 00:24:08.165
Sure.

340
00:24:18.845 --> 00:24:20.946
I heard you meet with Mr. Park often.

341
00:24:21.845 --> 00:24:24.815
Then have you been acting as his spy?

342
00:24:24.946 --> 00:24:26.186
His spy?

343
00:24:28.055 --> 00:24:31.055
They want to know where Yoon Dal Hong is.

344
00:24:34.555 --> 00:24:36.426
They caught me.

345
00:24:38.766 --> 00:24:40.635
It means our contract is over.

346
00:24:43.865 --> 00:24:46.105
Do you really abduct people...

347
00:24:46.105 --> 00:24:47.375
and lock them up?

348
00:24:48.375 --> 00:24:50.345
He's probably at a warehouse in Changwon.

349
00:24:58.016 --> 00:24:59.256
He's not here.

350
00:25:00.486 --> 00:25:02.855
Can we check that one?

351
00:25:22.676 --> 00:25:24.976
They looked through every warehouse in Changwon,

352
00:25:25.105 --> 00:25:27.315
and even abandoned houses and schools,

353
00:25:27.415 --> 00:25:28.676
but he wasn't found.

354
00:25:31.286 --> 00:25:34.155
They want to know where he's buried.

355
00:25:40.756 --> 00:25:42.325
Tell them that I'll find him.

356
00:25:43.165 --> 00:25:44.325
No matter if he's buried...

357
00:25:46.236 --> 00:25:47.496
or if he's alive.

358
00:25:55.746 --> 00:25:57.776
That's so tacky.

359
00:25:59.446 --> 00:26:00.446
What did you say?

360
00:26:00.446 --> 00:26:02.246
What is this? This is unnecessary.

361
00:26:03.115 --> 00:26:05.446
This isn't your style.

362
00:26:06.456 --> 00:26:07.585
Yes.

363
00:26:08.716 --> 00:26:10.325
This is really awful.

364
00:26:13.855 --> 00:26:15.325
Where have you been?

365
00:26:15.325 --> 00:26:17.426
Why are you so out of it?

366
00:26:18.625 --> 00:26:20.996
Is it because you're still jet-lagged?

367
00:26:20.996 --> 00:26:22.036
Seung Goo.

368
00:26:24.135 --> 00:26:27.236
May I borrow that ring?

369
00:26:42.825 --> 00:26:43.926
It didn't work.

370
00:26:45.726 --> 00:26:48.355
It feels like something is missing from me.

371
00:26:50.595 --> 00:26:51.665
What is it?

372
00:26:52.365 --> 00:26:53.365
Congratulations.

373
00:26:53.365 --> 00:26:55.805
Thank you. We worked very hard.

374
00:26:56.006 --> 00:26:58.065
Work harder. Like me.

375
00:26:58.736 --> 00:27:01.936
Sure. Yes, I'll try harder just like you.

376
00:27:04.105 --> 00:27:06.575
I'm sorry. I was helping the airport team.

377
00:27:08.115 --> 00:27:09.585
- Ms. Jung. - Yes?

378
00:27:10.446 --> 00:27:11.986
You must've had a great dream last night.

379
00:27:11.986 --> 00:27:12.986
Pardon?

380
00:27:12.986 --> 00:27:15.555
They recommended you to work two years overseas.

381
00:27:16.355 --> 00:27:17.486
Really?

382
00:27:17.486 --> 00:27:19.055
Congratulations, Hae Ra.

383
00:27:19.395 --> 00:27:20.956
The chairman's sister-in-law's friend...

384
00:27:20.956 --> 00:27:22.926
was a part of the reunion group.

385
00:27:22.926 --> 00:27:24.466
She was really touched.

386
00:27:24.796 --> 00:27:26.835
You were good to them knowing this, right?

387
00:27:26.835 --> 00:27:29.206
That makes no sense.

388
00:27:29.206 --> 00:27:30.365
She received...

389
00:27:30.365 --> 00:27:32.335
the most thank you letters among everyone here.

390
00:27:32.476 --> 00:27:34.236
She got promoted way too late,

391
00:27:34.236 --> 00:27:36.006
and she never got to go overseas until now.

392
00:27:36.305 --> 00:27:37.605
Anyway,

393
00:27:37.605 --> 00:27:39.946
you finally get to go work overseas.

394
00:27:39.946 --> 00:27:41.415
And it's Rome, Italy.

395
00:27:41.415 --> 00:27:43.046
My gosh.

396
00:27:43.486 --> 00:27:44.746
It's really close to...

397
00:27:44.746 --> 00:27:46.716
Slovenia, your first travel destination.

398
00:27:47.155 --> 00:27:49.325
Then when do I start?

399
00:27:49.325 --> 00:27:50.885
After the first quarter.

400
00:27:50.885 --> 00:27:52.625
You'll leave early April.

401
00:27:54.395 --> 00:27:55.726
That fast?

402
00:27:55.865 --> 00:27:57.125
Aren't you so glad?

403
00:27:57.125 --> 00:27:59.296
Their dorm is as good as a hotel.

404
00:27:59.296 --> 00:28:01.196
I'll visit you during Chuseok holidays.

405
00:28:01.436 --> 00:28:02.466
Me too.

406
00:28:03.835 --> 00:28:05.266
I hope you're joking.

407
00:28:06.276 --> 00:28:07.936
Are you really going too?

408
00:28:07.936 --> 00:28:09.105
Ju Hee, get to work.

409
00:28:23.355 --> 00:28:24.655
If you're jealous,

410
00:28:25.325 --> 00:28:27.426
then why do you want to go abroad?

411
00:28:27.855 --> 00:28:29.796
I returned to Korea for you.

412
00:28:34.036 --> 00:28:36.165
What should I do...

413
00:28:36.165 --> 00:28:37.506
to live here like you?

414
00:28:40.135 --> 00:28:41.536
Should I learn how to take pictures...

415
00:28:41.536 --> 00:28:43.305
and speak Slovenian?

416
00:28:44.206 --> 00:28:45.746
Why do you want to live here?

417
00:28:45.746 --> 00:28:47.345
I want to leave...

418
00:28:47.575 --> 00:28:49.516
from everything around me.

419
00:28:50.546 --> 00:28:53.186
I never had a chance when I wanted to leave.

420
00:28:54.486 --> 00:28:56.085
Why did it have to come now?

421
00:29:15.976 --> 00:29:17.706
It's such a horrible thing,

422
00:29:18.145 --> 00:29:20.375
so I never took it out after that day.

423
00:29:28.055 --> 00:29:29.456
It's pretty sharp.

424
00:29:29.926 --> 00:29:31.085
One second.

425
00:29:44.006 --> 00:29:45.536
Did you turn the ring I gave you...

426
00:29:46.206 --> 00:29:47.835
into matching rings?

427
00:29:48.575 --> 00:29:51.176
No, he said it shouldn't be melted,

428
00:29:51.176 --> 00:29:52.645
so Hae Ra is keeping it.

429
00:29:55.246 --> 00:29:56.815
Can you show me that ring?

430
00:29:57.415 --> 00:29:58.486
Sure.

431
00:30:05.825 --> 00:30:08.426
They said I bled so much that my heart stopped.

432
00:30:09.196 --> 00:30:10.996
But I do not see any wounds in my body.

433
00:30:12.226 --> 00:30:15.865
Unseen powers must have protected you.

434
00:30:17.206 --> 00:30:18.466
Even so,

435
00:30:18.466 --> 00:30:20.436
I'm sure it can't erase scars.

436
00:30:22.546 --> 00:30:24.206
It looks like a normal knife.

437
00:30:38.655 --> 00:30:39.726
Yes?

438
00:30:39.726 --> 00:30:40.825
Soo Ho.

439
00:30:49.365 --> 00:30:50.905
May I take it and show it to her?

440
00:30:50.905 --> 00:30:52.065
Of course.

441
00:30:54.176 --> 00:30:56.145
Did you tell your boss about the wedding?

442
00:30:58.805 --> 00:31:00.676
Not yet. Everyone was out,

443
00:31:00.676 --> 00:31:02.415
and we were busy into the night.

444
00:31:03.046 --> 00:31:04.246
I'll do it tomorrow.

445
00:31:05.546 --> 00:31:06.986
Everyone at my work is thrilled...

446
00:31:06.986 --> 00:31:08.415
to be at the party.

447
00:31:15.439 --> 00:31:20.439
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E18 Black Knight "You Can't Fool Me"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

448
00:32:27.036 --> 00:32:28.766
- Hello. - Welcome.

449
00:32:29.065 --> 00:32:30.665
- Hello. - Hi.

450
00:32:32.135 --> 00:32:33.635
Give it to me.

451
00:32:33.936 --> 00:32:35.536
- I'll take it. - Thank you.

452
00:32:36.305 --> 00:32:37.746
- Isn't it cold outside? - Yes.

453
00:32:37.746 --> 00:32:39.216
Do you want something warm to drink?

454
00:32:39.216 --> 00:32:40.415
I'll bring you some.

455
00:32:40.415 --> 00:32:41.875
You two can talk.

456
00:32:45.385 --> 00:32:46.855
- Please sit down. - Okay.

457
00:32:50.655 --> 00:32:52.655
Will you get the bouquet at the wedding?

458
00:32:52.655 --> 00:32:53.825
The wedding?

459
00:32:54.655 --> 00:32:56.766
Mr. Moon and Ms. Jung are getting married...

460
00:32:56.766 --> 00:32:57.895
next weekend.

461
00:32:58.595 --> 00:32:59.696
Really?

462
00:33:00.365 --> 00:33:03.065
But she's going to be working...

463
00:33:03.065 --> 00:33:05.105
in the office in Rome for two years.

464
00:33:06.536 --> 00:33:09.305
She won't get to enjoy her honeymoon phase then.

465
00:33:10.375 --> 00:33:12.615
My mother-in-law sold her farmland...

466
00:33:12.615 --> 00:33:15.016
and gave the money to me before she died.

467
00:33:15.016 --> 00:33:17.716
I used that money to buy the house.

468
00:33:17.885 --> 00:33:20.155
There's is no connection between the fire...

469
00:33:20.155 --> 00:33:23.385
in the lab and me buying the house, sir.

470
00:33:25.186 --> 00:33:26.426
Do you have proof?

471
00:33:28.296 --> 00:33:30.996
I heard Jang Chul Doo was given money...

472
00:33:30.996 --> 00:33:32.736
to make it look like...

473
00:33:34.135 --> 00:33:35.665
it was cause by a short circuit.

474
00:33:35.905 --> 00:33:38.305
At the time of the fire,

475
00:33:38.766 --> 00:33:41.206
he was in the hospital for alcoholic rehab.

476
00:33:42.776 --> 00:33:46.676
You can't believe all that, sir.

477
00:33:46.676 --> 00:33:47.976
Come on.

478
00:33:47.976 --> 00:33:49.216
Bring him in.

479
00:33:59.055 --> 00:34:00.296
That's him.

480
00:34:01.055 --> 00:34:02.996
The one who set the lab on fire for money.

481
00:34:04.165 --> 00:34:05.426
I threatened him,

482
00:34:05.526 --> 00:34:07.435
so he gave me a house and some land.

483
00:34:08.196 --> 00:34:09.335
That money must have...

484
00:34:09.335 --> 00:34:11.105
come from the construction firm.

485
00:34:17.806 --> 00:34:19.546
The investigation is going well.

486
00:34:19.576 --> 00:34:21.676
Mr. Park is holding out pretty well though.

487
00:34:22.745 --> 00:34:25.386
Both your dad's case and Geumseong-dong...

488
00:34:25.386 --> 00:34:26.955
will take time.

489
00:34:27.315 --> 00:34:29.785
But I'm ready to wait with patience.

490
00:34:31.585 --> 00:34:33.526
Why didn't you tell me about your transfer?

491
00:34:34.955 --> 00:34:37.125
It would've been nice if you told me first.

492
00:34:39.236 --> 00:34:40.895
Sorry, I was a bit dazed.

493
00:34:42.765 --> 00:34:44.435
Anyway, I don't want you to go.

494
00:34:46.076 --> 00:34:48.276
I don't want us to be separated.

495
00:34:48.776 --> 00:34:50.245
Also, Rome is dangerous to be alone.

496
00:34:51.105 --> 00:34:52.875
The same goes for anywhere.

497
00:34:53.475 --> 00:34:55.446
No place is safe from terrorism.

498
00:34:56.216 --> 00:34:57.515
Not just that,

499
00:34:57.846 --> 00:34:59.915
I don't want to be away from you.

500
00:35:00.656 --> 00:35:02.986
So I should just answer calls in the office?

501
00:35:09.296 --> 00:35:10.326
You submit proposals,

502
00:35:10.326 --> 00:35:11.565
and get compliments.

503
00:35:11.565 --> 00:35:13.636
I'm sure better opportunities will come.

504
00:35:16.406 --> 00:35:17.765
How do you know that?

505
00:35:20.906 --> 00:35:22.676
I want to go to Rome office.

506
00:35:23.676 --> 00:35:25.875
I told you since we first met.

507
00:35:25.875 --> 00:35:28.245
I wasn't in your life then.

508
00:35:28.245 --> 00:35:29.515
It's different now.

509
00:35:31.446 --> 00:35:34.256
You're the most important person in my life,

510
00:35:34.855 --> 00:35:36.085
but my life is important too.

511
00:35:36.085 --> 00:35:37.225
So I want to go.

512
00:35:45.526 --> 00:35:47.935
All right. Do as you please.

513
00:35:49.165 --> 00:35:50.265
I'll wait.

514
00:35:51.366 --> 00:35:53.006
We can cancel the wedding.

515
00:35:57.806 --> 00:35:59.346
I have to go. I have a meeting.

516
00:36:10.355 --> 00:36:11.355
No.

517
00:36:12.826 --> 00:36:14.026
This isn't it.

518
00:36:14.895 --> 00:36:15.926
Gosh.

519
00:36:15.926 --> 00:36:18.526
What is it? What's wrong?

520
00:36:19.265 --> 00:36:21.966
I feel like I lost my color, so I'm upset

521
00:36:22.866 --> 00:36:24.065
I don't know what it is.

522
00:36:24.765 --> 00:36:26.035
Darn it.

523
00:36:26.605 --> 00:36:28.276
This is horrible.

524
00:36:30.546 --> 00:36:33.446
Why are my designs so childish?

525
00:36:36.815 --> 00:36:39.386
Should I meet with Moon Soo Ho?

526
00:36:41.716 --> 00:36:43.156
If I remember him,

527
00:36:43.426 --> 00:36:45.426
my ingenuity might come back.

528
00:36:45.796 --> 00:36:46.796
I...

529
00:36:47.556 --> 00:36:48.625
Well...

530
00:36:49.526 --> 00:36:52.535
Why don't you sleep on it?

531
00:37:06.875 --> 00:37:08.046
Sharon...

532
00:37:09.486 --> 00:37:11.585
made a trick.

533
00:37:15.216 --> 00:37:16.955
This ring is fake.

534
00:37:22.466 --> 00:37:23.495
Sharon.

535
00:37:24.426 --> 00:37:25.935
This isn't your style.

536
00:37:28.466 --> 00:37:29.736
Did I lose it...

537
00:37:29.736 --> 00:37:31.506
because I came back so soon?

538
00:37:32.975 --> 00:37:35.176
I know this isn't it.

539
00:37:36.076 --> 00:37:37.276
I feel like something is missing.

540
00:37:39.315 --> 00:37:41.475
Is there something I'm not remembering...

541
00:37:41.475 --> 00:37:42.986
or forgetting?

542
00:37:43.716 --> 00:37:45.145
There's nothing like that.

543
00:37:46.116 --> 00:37:47.256
Baek Hee.

544
00:37:48.415 --> 00:37:50.156
Are you close with Moon Soo Ho?

545
00:37:52.955 --> 00:37:55.765
Who is Moon Soo Ho?

546
00:37:56.165 --> 00:37:58.466
They said I liked him a lot.

547
00:37:59.236 --> 00:38:01.196
And he loved someone else.

548
00:38:02.935 --> 00:38:05.565
There isn't a man who wouldn't like you.

549
00:38:06.605 --> 00:38:08.306
Someone must've played a joke on you.

550
00:38:09.076 --> 00:38:10.105
Don't believe that.

551
00:38:13.046 --> 00:38:14.116
Right?

552
00:38:18.716 --> 00:38:20.685
Turn to page three.

553
00:38:24.785 --> 00:38:28.256
This is a new business proposal...

554
00:38:28.256 --> 00:38:30.725
aside from Geumseong-dong project.

555
00:38:30.926 --> 00:38:33.065
Please look at the appendix first.

556
00:38:34.265 --> 00:38:36.065
On page three,

557
00:38:36.065 --> 00:38:37.866
there are statistics.

558
00:38:54.585 --> 00:38:55.855
Soo Ho.

559
00:39:08.096 --> 00:39:09.605
Please take a look,

560
00:39:10.406 --> 00:39:13.076
and feel free to ask questions.

561
00:39:23.585 --> 00:39:24.915
You aren't crying, are you?

562
00:39:26.915 --> 00:39:28.216
I'm sorry, I was wrong.

563
00:39:45.665 --> 00:39:47.136
It'll be for two years only.

564
00:39:47.435 --> 00:39:48.736
I'll visit you often.

565
00:39:54.176 --> 00:39:55.276
I'm sorry.

566
00:39:56.846 --> 00:39:58.616
Be happy about it since you're going anyway.

567
00:39:59.216 --> 00:40:00.685
We'll video chat every day.

568
00:40:00.716 --> 00:40:02.355
I'll visit you whenever I have time.

569
00:40:05.285 --> 00:40:06.355
Soo Ho.

570
00:40:18.506 --> 00:40:19.576
Thank you.

571
00:40:40.656 --> 00:40:42.395
Thanks for coming.

572
00:40:42.395 --> 00:40:45.196
- This is nice. - It's so wonderful.

573
00:40:45.196 --> 00:40:46.696
- It's nice. - It is.

574
00:40:50.935 --> 00:40:52.875
Don't they look great?

575
00:40:53.006 --> 00:40:55.576
Finally, Hae Ra is getting married.

576
00:40:55.576 --> 00:40:57.276
Even before you.

577
00:40:58.245 --> 00:41:00.216
You two should get married soon.

578
00:41:00.375 --> 00:41:01.475
We will.

579
00:41:01.475 --> 00:41:03.386
When?

580
00:41:04.415 --> 00:41:06.185
- That picture is nice. - Isn't it?

581
00:41:09.585 --> 00:41:12.596
I think a small wedding like this is good.

582
00:41:12.596 --> 00:41:14.256
It's all good as long as they love each other.

583
00:41:14.256 --> 00:41:16.065
I can't do this in my house though.

584
00:41:16.065 --> 00:41:17.796
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

585
00:41:17.796 --> 00:41:20.335
Your house is really fabulous.

586
00:41:20.636 --> 00:41:23.435
I'm so jealous that you're having a home wedding.

587
00:41:23.835 --> 00:41:26.035
I would've done the same if I had a home like this.

588
00:41:27.236 --> 00:41:28.776
Bride's waiting room is over there.

589
00:41:28.776 --> 00:41:29.776
- Is it? - Is it?

590
00:41:30.975 --> 00:41:32.046
Hae Ra.

591
00:41:32.306 --> 00:41:33.546
What about them?

592
00:41:33.546 --> 00:41:35.015
- They're all ready. - Thank you.

593
00:41:35.785 --> 00:41:36.886
Congratulations.

594
00:41:42.256 --> 00:41:43.386
There's a fierce competition...

595
00:41:43.386 --> 00:41:44.526
on who'll catch your bouquet.

596
00:41:45.056 --> 00:41:47.256
Throw it nicely later so that I can catch it.

597
00:41:47.656 --> 00:41:48.796
Okay.

598
00:41:51.225 --> 00:41:53.995
Gosh, are you nervous?

599
00:41:55.835 --> 00:41:56.866
Yes.

600
00:41:56.866 --> 00:41:57.906
Don't be.

601
00:41:57.906 --> 00:41:59.676
Only your close friends are here,

602
00:41:59.676 --> 00:42:01.076
so there's no need to be nervous.

603
00:42:01.076 --> 00:42:02.136
You can do it.

604
00:42:03.375 --> 00:42:04.875
Ju Hee, can you tell Soo Ho to come here?

605
00:42:04.875 --> 00:42:06.576
- Can you do that for me? - Okay.

606
00:42:11.216 --> 00:42:12.986
Maybe he got your telepathy.

607
00:42:13.085 --> 00:42:14.756
We'll go take a tour around the house.

608
00:42:14.756 --> 00:42:16.026
Let's go, Ju Hee.

609
00:42:16.125 --> 00:42:17.256
We'll go look around.

610
00:42:17.256 --> 00:42:19.056
- Okay. - See you.

611
00:42:23.926 --> 00:42:24.966
Soo Ho.

612
00:42:26.096 --> 00:42:28.665
I'm nervous. What should I do?

613
00:42:46.156 --> 00:42:47.355
Are you okay now?

614
00:42:48.955 --> 00:42:50.526
I'm still nervous.

615
00:42:51.685 --> 00:42:53.156
Actually, I'm nervous too.

616
00:42:57.526 --> 00:42:58.596
Yes?

617
00:43:00.366 --> 00:43:02.265
The officiant is here.

618
00:43:02.705 --> 00:43:03.966
We'll go out soon.

619
00:43:10.806 --> 00:43:11.906
You look pretty.

620
00:43:14.046 --> 00:43:15.145
You look good too.

621
00:43:22.826 --> 00:43:25.585
- Congratulations! - Be happy.

622
00:43:26.125 --> 00:43:27.656
Congratulations.

623
00:43:27.656 --> 00:43:29.026
Congrats!

624
00:43:33.395 --> 00:43:35.335
You look wonderful together!

625
00:43:38.605 --> 00:43:41.835
How pretty. How nice.

626
00:43:43.006 --> 00:43:45.046
- Hae Ra, look here. - Congratulations.

627
00:43:45.046 --> 00:43:46.776
- Congratulations. - Be happy.

628
00:43:47.046 --> 00:43:50.046
- Congrats! - How pretty!

629
00:43:50.846 --> 00:43:53.285
- How handsome. - Congratulations!

630
00:44:03.966 --> 00:44:05.125
Today...

631
00:44:06.065 --> 00:44:08.395
is such a happy and grateful day.

632
00:44:09.806 --> 00:44:11.306
I've waited this moment...

633
00:44:11.705 --> 00:44:13.906
for more than 200 years.

634
00:44:13.906 --> 00:44:16.205
I've waited for 330 years.

635
00:44:19.076 --> 00:44:21.346
I guess it's better to make a short comment.

636
00:44:22.145 --> 00:44:24.645
I want to say just one thing.

637
00:44:27.256 --> 00:44:29.826
May you live...

638
00:44:30.625 --> 00:44:32.526
happily ever after.

639
00:44:33.556 --> 00:44:34.926
Thank you.

640
00:44:43.406 --> 00:44:46.676
Groom, please say a word to your guests.

641
00:44:52.076 --> 00:44:54.815
I'm finally getting married today.

642
00:44:57.116 --> 00:44:59.185
You're the witnesses of our marriage.

643
00:44:59.415 --> 00:45:01.656
Until the day I die,

644
00:45:01.656 --> 00:45:03.656
I'll love only Hae Ra...

645
00:45:03.926 --> 00:45:06.056
and live only for Hae Ra.

646
00:45:06.056 --> 00:45:07.125
Thank you.

647
00:45:12.395 --> 00:45:14.296
Bride, say a word too.

648
00:45:17.306 --> 00:45:20.506
Thank you for being here at our wedding.

649
00:45:20.636 --> 00:45:22.446
I'm so grateful...

650
00:45:23.046 --> 00:45:26.015
to my first love, Soo Ho,

651
00:45:26.145 --> 00:45:27.515
more than anyone else.

652
00:45:28.946 --> 00:45:30.685
Don't cry, Hae Ra.

653
00:45:30.685 --> 00:45:31.745
Don't cry.

654
00:45:32.455 --> 00:45:34.256
Why would you cry?

655
00:45:34.256 --> 00:45:36.926
- Don't cry. - Don't cry.

656
00:45:36.926 --> 00:45:39.355
Don't cry.

657
00:45:42.026 --> 00:45:44.796
I'll live life to the full and diligently.

658
00:45:46.736 --> 00:45:48.395
Give each other a kiss.

659
00:45:48.395 --> 00:45:50.335
Kiss each other.

660
00:45:50.506 --> 00:45:53.276
- Kiss. - Kiss.

661
00:45:53.276 --> 00:45:56.006
- Kiss. - Kiss.

662
00:45:56.006 --> 00:45:58.006
There you go.

663
00:45:58.006 --> 00:45:59.245
They kissed.

664
00:46:01.576 --> 00:46:03.685
- Thank you. - Thank you.

665
00:46:03.685 --> 00:46:05.386
They kissed.

666
00:46:05.986 --> 00:46:07.685
- Thank you. - Thank you.

667
00:46:19.596 --> 00:46:20.636
Baek Hee.

668
00:46:22.765 --> 00:46:24.136
Where did she go?

669
00:46:37.645 --> 00:46:38.716
What?

670
00:46:39.616 --> 00:46:41.216
It's that customer from before.

671
00:46:50.826 --> 00:46:52.165
What's this coat?

672
00:46:59.435 --> 00:47:01.435
When did I make Baek Hee this coat?

673
00:47:11.145 --> 00:47:13.486
I ordered a coat here...

674
00:47:13.486 --> 00:47:15.116
and forgot to take it when I was little.

675
00:47:17.285 --> 00:47:19.355
Let me be you.

676
00:47:21.196 --> 00:47:23.026
Let's change each other's lives.

677
00:47:24.265 --> 00:47:26.196
Ever since I wore this coat,

678
00:47:26.335 --> 00:47:28.136
strange things keep happening to me.

679
00:47:32.366 --> 00:47:33.975
I'm thankful for the coat,

680
00:47:35.535 --> 00:47:37.076
but I'm also scared of it.

681
00:47:59.435 --> 00:48:01.065
Why are you standing there?

682
00:48:01.966 --> 00:48:02.966
How exciting!

683
00:48:02.966 --> 00:48:04.165
1, 2, 3.

684
00:48:26.056 --> 00:48:27.696
It was you.

685
00:48:30.065 --> 00:48:32.296
My missing screw was you.

686
00:49:35.355 --> 00:49:36.495
Sharon.

687
00:49:48.906 --> 00:49:50.406
Welcome, Chul Min.

688
00:49:52.076 --> 00:49:53.176
Seo Rin.

689
00:49:53.176 --> 00:49:54.315
Long time no see.

690
00:49:54.315 --> 00:49:55.375
Seo Rin.

691
00:49:56.315 --> 00:49:59.756
I thought it was a prank call.

692
00:50:00.585 --> 00:50:03.785
I heard you've become rich.

693
00:50:08.056 --> 00:50:09.725
I kept my promise...

694
00:50:10.926 --> 00:50:11.966
with you.

695
00:50:13.495 --> 00:50:14.966
That's great, Chul Min.

696
00:50:17.105 --> 00:50:18.636
Shall we give each other a hug?

697
00:50:30.486 --> 00:50:31.815
I missed you, Seo Rin.

698
00:50:32.756 --> 00:50:34.585
You're still the same as when you were young.

699
00:50:35.256 --> 00:50:36.455
You're still cute.

700
00:50:43.096 --> 00:50:44.165
Have a seat.

701
00:50:48.366 --> 00:50:51.366
Let's have a drink and talk about the old times.

702
00:50:52.475 --> 00:50:55.205
No, I don't want to.

703
00:50:57.846 --> 00:51:00.546
I want to stay sober and see your face...

704
00:51:01.716 --> 00:51:04.815
which hasn't gotten old at all.

705
00:51:05.855 --> 00:51:06.955
I got old.

706
00:51:06.955 --> 00:51:07.986
Seo Rin.

707
00:51:08.656 --> 00:51:10.585
What's the secret?

708
00:51:11.386 --> 00:51:14.196
Tell me how you manage to stay young.

709
00:51:16.096 --> 00:51:17.625
It's the facial treatment.

710
00:51:20.535 --> 00:51:23.136
Don't try to fool me around.

711
00:51:25.105 --> 00:51:28.506
My pure love towards you is still the same,

712
00:51:29.705 --> 00:51:33.846
but I'm not the naive and young Chul Min anymore.

713
00:51:35.785 --> 00:51:36.846
I like your attitude.

714
00:51:38.685 --> 00:51:41.216
It looks like we can really talk.

715
00:51:50.196 --> 00:51:52.225
I've never been on a nationwide tour before.

716
00:51:52.225 --> 00:51:53.366
Let's find the best restaurants...

717
00:51:53.366 --> 00:51:54.966
and eat five meals a day.

718
00:51:55.065 --> 00:51:56.705
Okay. I can do that.

719
00:52:13.386 --> 00:52:14.386
Do you like it?

720
00:52:14.455 --> 00:52:15.926
It's wonderful.

721
00:52:26.395 --> 00:52:27.866
This is really great.

722
00:52:30.506 --> 00:52:31.605
What is this?

723
00:52:31.605 --> 00:52:33.236
When did you prepare all these?

724
00:52:33.406 --> 00:52:35.205
People at my work did.

725
00:52:35.605 --> 00:52:36.975
My gosh.

726
00:52:37.705 --> 00:52:39.846
- Some champagne? - Sounds great.

727
00:52:39.846 --> 00:52:40.875
Let's go.

728
00:52:53.855 --> 00:52:55.355
Congratulations, my wife.

729
00:52:55.495 --> 00:52:56.725
Congratulations, my husband.

730
00:53:05.806 --> 00:53:06.935
What should we do now?

731
00:53:20.585 --> 00:53:23.486
You deceived me and fooled me.

732
00:53:23.685 --> 00:53:24.855
They had...

733
00:53:25.756 --> 00:53:28.156
a very beautiful wedding.

734
00:53:30.625 --> 00:53:32.096
It's all over.

735
00:53:32.096 --> 00:53:34.636
I will make you pay for what you did.

736
00:53:34.636 --> 00:53:35.636
Sharon.

737
00:53:37.765 --> 00:53:39.435
This is...

738
00:53:41.205 --> 00:53:42.605
as far as we go.

739
00:53:45.205 --> 00:53:46.475
I don't have...

740
00:53:47.616 --> 00:53:49.046
the confidence to deal with you.

741
00:53:54.085 --> 00:53:55.515
Goodbye, Becky.

742
00:54:30.886 --> 00:54:32.556
Let's eat dinner at these two places.

743
00:54:33.696 --> 00:54:36.225
This place takes about 30 minutes by car,

744
00:54:36.326 --> 00:54:37.625
and this takes an hour.

745
00:54:40.596 --> 00:54:43.306
Isn't this place on our way tomorrow?

746
00:54:44.535 --> 00:54:45.935
Then what should we eat for dinner?

747
00:54:46.035 --> 00:54:47.035
Do you want me to cook for you?

748
00:54:47.475 --> 00:54:48.605
What will you make?

749
00:54:50.406 --> 00:54:52.006
I saw a fish market nearby.

750
00:54:52.006 --> 00:54:53.015
Do you want spicy fish stew?

751
00:54:53.015 --> 00:54:54.446
Aren't you craving something spicy?

752
00:54:54.915 --> 00:54:56.346
I am. I'll go with you.

753
00:54:56.815 --> 00:54:58.745
Get some rest. I'll do everything for you.

754
00:54:59.216 --> 00:55:00.915
Then I'll just wash some fruit.

755
00:55:01.915 --> 00:55:03.386
- Hae Ra. - Yes?

756
00:55:05.225 --> 00:55:06.455
This isn't a dream, is it?

757
00:55:14.096 --> 00:55:15.236
It's not a dream.

758
00:56:39.716 --> 00:56:41.085
There it is.

759
00:56:41.355 --> 00:56:43.056
Sharon's chic style.

760
00:59:41.796 --> 00:59:42.806
What is it?

761
00:59:42.806 --> 00:59:43.866
What's that?

762
00:59:43.866 --> 00:59:45.065
It's an accident.

763
00:59:47.776 --> 00:59:49.245
I think it's a real accident.

764
00:59:49.406 --> 00:59:50.846
I think we should report this.

765
00:59:51.276 --> 00:59:52.415
Right.

766
00:59:57.085 --> 00:59:59.085
We're at the intersection by the railroad.

767
00:59:59.085 --> 01:00:00.616
It's a huge accident.

768
01:00:00.616 --> 01:00:01.815
You have to hurry.

769
01:00:57.605 --> 01:00:58.676
What's going on?

770
01:01:13.326 --> 01:01:14.625
May I borrow your phone?
