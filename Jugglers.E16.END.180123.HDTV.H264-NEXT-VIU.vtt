Let's go back.

7
00:01:09.145 --> 00:01:12.675
I've never been so excited to pack before.

8
00:01:42.175 --> 00:01:43.345
Are you all packed?

9
00:01:43.444 --> 00:01:44.845

Didn't HR contact you?

14
00:02:00.925 --> 00:02:03.824
Ms. Jwa, you can take all of your belongings...

15
00:02:03.824 --> 00:02:05.464
to YB Department Store's...

Did you unpack already?

20
00:02:34.994 --> 00:02:37.195
You shouldn't have. You'll have to pack again.

21
00:02:37.195 --> 00:02:38.195
What is it?

22
00:02:38.195 --> 00:02:40.795
Are you mad about Yoon Yi's new position?

23
00:02:41.795 --> 00:02:43.705
Yes. I'm mad, you jerk.

24
00:02:43.705 --> 00:02:44.705
Jerk?

25
00:02:45.434 --> 00:02:47.205
Are you trying to pick a fight?

26
00:02:47.205 --> 00:02:48.504
You might not know,

27
00:02:48.605 --> 00:02:50.145
but I repay violence with violence,

28
00:02:50.145 --> 00:02:52.274
foul for foul, and for tricks...

29
00:02:52.975 --> 00:02:55.445
I have a bad habit of playing tricks as well.

30
00:02:56.415 --> 00:02:57.485
That's why...

31
00:02:58.084 --> 00:02:59.784
you should watch your back.

32
00:03:02.885 --> 00:03:03.885
Also,

33
00:03:05.154 --> 00:03:07.054
you got yourself a new role.

34
00:03:07.054 --> 00:03:09.464
I thought I shouldn't come empty-handed.

35
00:03:15.034 --> 00:03:16.665
Is he crazy?

36
00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:19.504
What is that?

37
00:03:20.774 --> 00:03:23.545
Is he trying to be mean or nice?

38
00:03:23.545 --> 00:03:24.705
Gosh.

39
00:03:25.105 --> 00:03:26.814
Is he trying to bribe me?

40
00:03:31.814 --> 00:03:32.814
Wait...

41
00:03:34.455 --> 00:03:35.455
This is...

42
00:03:36.254 --> 00:03:37.784
It's taffy.

43
00:03:38.325 --> 00:03:41.355
Is he cursing me?

44
00:03:44.225 --> 00:03:47.334
You rude punk!

45
00:03:47.334 --> 00:03:49.504
Gosh, he makes me mad.

46
00:04:01.344 --> 00:04:05.445
I could chew him up and that wouldn't be enough.

47
00:04:06.314 --> 00:04:09.084
Hey, should I go after him...

48
00:04:09.084 --> 00:04:11.254
and kick him like this?

49
00:04:12.955 --> 00:04:14.455
Why are you doing this?

50
00:04:14.725 --> 00:04:15.725
Too bad.

51
00:04:16.394 --> 00:04:17.394
I'm leaving.

52
00:04:17.624 --> 00:04:21.095
Why is an assistant going to customer service?

53
00:04:21.095 --> 00:04:22.634
This kind of relocation...

54
00:04:22.634 --> 00:04:25.035
is like telling me to quit my job.

55
00:04:26.374 --> 00:04:27.905
Who is he to tell you that?

56
00:04:27.905 --> 00:04:30.775
Exactly. Why should I quit for him?

57
00:04:33.715 --> 00:04:34.845
I'll guarantee it.

58
00:04:35.074 --> 00:04:37.615
I'll make you stick to me like glue.

59
00:04:37.615 --> 00:04:38.845
You'll be stuck to me forever.

60
00:04:38.845 --> 00:04:40.254
I'll make that happen.

61
00:04:43.384 --> 00:04:44.485
It won't take long.

62
00:04:45.384 --> 00:04:46.394
Okay.

63
00:04:52.264 --> 00:04:53.665
I'm sick...

64
00:04:53.665 --> 00:04:55.465
of carrying this around.

65
00:04:55.905 --> 00:04:57.165
Just take this...

66
00:04:57.365 --> 00:04:58.865
and put it on my desk.

67
00:04:58.934 --> 00:05:01.374
I'll be back soon anyway, right?

68
00:05:01.434 --> 00:05:04.374
Are you pressuring me...

69
00:05:04.374 --> 00:05:05.675
to work harder?

70
00:05:07.675 --> 00:05:10.915
Yes. I'm giving you a lot of pressure.

71
00:05:12.554 --> 00:05:13.655
It's very like you.

72
00:05:13.655 --> 00:05:16.355
Fight well like you always do.

73
00:05:26.965 --> 00:05:27.965
What is this?

74
00:05:28.165 --> 00:05:30.004
- What? - My goodness.

75
00:05:33.335 --> 00:05:37.275
Starting now, all business related to e-sports...

76
00:05:37.275 --> 00:05:38.605
must be halted per the chairman's order.

77
00:05:39.915 --> 00:05:41.814
- Wait. - What are you doing?

78
00:05:42.215 --> 00:05:43.644
Mr. Hong.

79
00:05:43.644 --> 00:05:45.884
Hey, what are you doing?

80
00:05:45.884 --> 00:05:47.054
Gosh...

81
00:05:47.054 --> 00:05:48.814
- Stop. - Wait.

82
00:05:48.814 --> 00:05:50.324
What are you doing?

83
00:06:05.105 --> 00:06:06.634
I'm sure you already knew what would happen...

84
00:06:06.634 --> 00:06:09.504
when you acted against their words.

85
00:06:09.504 --> 00:06:12.105
And? What is it that you want from me?

86
00:06:12.105 --> 00:06:13.215
It's simple.

87
00:06:13.444 --> 00:06:15.244
Stop your e-sports business,

88
00:06:15.444 --> 00:06:17.345
and have Ms. Wang leave the company.

89
00:06:18.014 --> 00:06:20.785
You should do as you're told just like before.

90
00:06:20.785 --> 00:06:23.624
Then, I'll leave.

91
00:06:23.624 --> 00:06:26.554
Please let him continue his work.

92
00:06:26.655 --> 00:06:27.655
No.

93
00:06:28.155 --> 00:06:29.494
I won't give up either of them.

94
00:06:30.925 --> 00:06:32.595
Go and tell those old geezers this.

95
00:06:32.595 --> 00:06:34.694
I want my share of the company right now.

96
00:06:34.965 --> 00:06:35.965
With that,

97
00:06:36.335 --> 00:06:38.335
I'm going to do what I want to do.

98
00:06:39.634 --> 00:06:40.634
Also,

99
00:06:41.105 --> 00:06:43.144
if they deny to give me my share,

100
00:06:43.975 --> 00:06:46.374
I'll tell the word what YB stands for...

101
00:06:46.975 --> 00:06:47.975
and that...

102
00:06:48.675 --> 00:06:50.615
we used have a lowly background...

103
00:06:50.615 --> 00:06:52.615
and that we paid for...

105
00:06:54.085 --> 00:06:55.115
Hey.

106
00:06:55.115 --> 00:06:56.485
Let go!

107
00:06:56.485 --> 00:06:58.684
Get off of him!

108
00:06:58.684 --> 00:07:01.725
Watch it. I'm going to tell the world!

109
00:07:01.725 --> 00:07:03.694
- But... - Even a tail...

110
00:07:03.694 --> 00:07:05.025
will squirm if you step on it.

111

116
00:07:21.244 --> 00:07:23.545
I'm a VVIP here.

117
00:07:23.814 --> 00:07:25.144
Tell the manager to come.

118
00:07:25.144 --> 00:07:26.355
Well...

119
00:07:27.954 --> 00:07:29.985
I'm sorry, ma'am.

Yoon Yi, I'll take over.

123
00:07:41.835 --> 00:07:44.064
Check the VVIP list...

124
00:07:44.764 --> 00:07:47.704
and the annoying customers list. Review it.

125

"America Pictures"?

129
00:08:23.405 --> 00:08:25.175
We should air...

130
00:08:26.215 --> 00:08:27.814
our special program earlier.

131
00:08:28.074 --> 00:08:29.085
Pardon?

132
00:08:29.314 --> 00:08:31.644
With Mr. Cho's new position,

133
00:08:31.784 --> 00:08:33.754
we don't know what he'll do to us next.

134

That's why we must move faster.

135
00:08:36.555 --> 00:08:37.624
But...

136
00:08:38.024 --> 00:08:40.855
America Pictures took so many jobs,

137
00:08:42.494 --> 00:08:44.065
but we can't get through to them.

138
00:08:44.825 --> 00:08:46.365
Also, we have never...

139
00:08:46.365 --> 00:08:48.134
seen their CEO.

140
00:08:48.134 --> 00:08:49.764
He's good at getting himself out.

141
00:08:49.764 --> 00:08:52.534
Should we just push forward?

142
00:08:52.534 --> 00:08:54.034
They won't open the door for us anyway.

143
00:08:54.034 --> 00:08:55.605
What's the point?

144
00:08:59.644 --> 00:09:00.774
There is no need to worry.

145
00:09:03.615 --> 00:09:05.085
If standard tactics don't work,

146
00:09:06.085 --> 00:09:07.384
we'll have to do what's unexpected.

Yes. I'm actually a sweet guy.

159
00:09:38.215 --> 00:09:40.985
Yes. How is Mr. Park Soon Taek's...

160
00:09:40.985 --> 00:09:42.725
schedule looking today?

161
00:09:42.725 --> 00:09:44.654
Really? Okay.

162
00:09:44.654 --> 00:09:47.225
Then, I'll send someone.

163
00:09:47.225 --> 00:09:49.095
Give them the documents I requested.

164
00:09:49.095 --> 00:09:52.124
I'm actually a sweet guy.

165

Do you want to be fired?

166
00:09:58.935 --> 00:10:01.975
Are you dying to get fired?

167
00:10:10.115 --> 00:10:12.254
Is he crazy?

168
00:10:14.654 --> 00:10:16.754
America Pictures...

169
00:10:16.955 --> 00:10:20.494
bought over a million gift cards every year.

170
00:10:20.924 --> 00:10:23.294
Doesn't it look strange?

171
00:10:23.365 --> 00:10:25.264
We should look into that.

172
00:10:25.994 --> 00:10:27.965
Okay, I'll call back later.

00:10:29.065 --> 00:10:31.335
Sir. We're ready.

174
00:10:31.335 --> 00:10:32.634
- Let's go. - Okay.

175
00:11:07.774 --> 00:11:09.205
- Mr. Hong. - Yes?

176
00:11:09.605 --> 00:11:10.605
What are you doing?

177
00:11:10.874 --> 00:11:13.215
I don't know. What was I doing?

178
00:11:14.044 --> 00:11:15.244
Didn't I look cool?

179
00:12:07.365 --> 00:12:10.965
By the way, why do you need...

180
00:12:11.365 --> 00:12:13.004
our daily records and transaction list?

181
00:12:14.205 --> 00:12:17.845
Mr. Cho wants to refer to it for the next bidding.

182
00:12:20.115 --> 00:12:21.674
- One moment. - Okay.

183
00:12:26.715 --> 00:12:27.815
What?

184
00:12:28.955 --> 00:12:31.085
What kind of nonsense is that?

185
00:12:31.685 --> 00:12:33.055
When did I say that?

186
00:12:34.924 --> 00:12:36.695
I never ordered that.

187
00:12:36.794 --> 00:12:37.965
Pardon?

188
00:12:38.195 --> 00:12:39.994
- Yes, that's right. - Who are you?

189
00:12:40.164 --> 00:12:41.935
- Go. - Stop them!

190
00:12:41.935 --> 00:12:43.435
Hold on! Hold on!

191
00:12:43.465 --> 00:12:46.004
- Wait, wait. - Cover me!

192
00:12:46.004 --> 00:12:48.374
- Hey! Stop him! - He's leaving.

193
00:12:48.374 --> 00:12:50.075
- Get him. - That hurts.

194
00:12:59.754 --> 00:13:00.955
Let's go.

195
00:13:01.485 --> 00:13:05.124
Unfortunately, I can't drive.

196
00:13:06.595 --> 00:13:07.924
What should we do?

197
00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:13.935
Excuse me, Mr. Park Soon Taek.

198
00:13:14.095 --> 00:13:15.805
What? Nam Chi Won?

199
00:13:24.205 --> 00:13:27.544
This is enough of a testimony,

200
00:13:29.014 --> 00:13:31.445
but there's no clear evidence to prove...

201
00:13:31.445 --> 00:13:33.315
that Mr. Cho received the bribe.

202
00:13:34.254 --> 00:13:36.825
The closest person to him should have it.

203
00:13:48.394 --> 00:13:49.634
Sorry.

204
00:13:50.164 --> 00:13:51.335
Hey.

205
00:13:51.565 --> 00:13:53.174
Did you delete everything...

206
00:13:53.174 --> 00:13:54.735
related to America Pictures?

207
00:13:57.075 --> 00:13:59.945
- Yes. - That punk.

208
00:13:59.945 --> 00:14:02.585
He said he would pay me back,

209
00:14:02.685 --> 00:14:05.085
and he actually impersonated me.

210
00:14:06.585 --> 00:14:10.325
They're all going to get fired soon.

211
00:14:10.555 --> 00:14:12.294
They're trying so hard.

212
00:14:17.924 --> 00:14:18.935
Wait.

213
00:14:20.164 --> 00:14:22.605
Isn't Yoon Yi here in customer service?

214
00:14:23.365 --> 00:14:24.935
Should we ask her to join us?

215
00:14:26.174 --> 00:14:27.575
No.

216
00:14:27.805 --> 00:14:29.674
I think that would make it uncomfortable.

217
00:14:29.674 --> 00:14:33.044
Why? You're the one who wanted her to relocate.

218
00:14:33.274 --> 00:14:34.815
Aren't you happy where she is now?

219
00:14:39.014 --> 00:14:41.384
Excuse me, sir. I'm going to the washroom.

220
00:14:41.555 --> 00:14:43.624
Okay. Go.

221
00:15:00.975 --> 00:15:03.575
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

222
00:15:03.774 --> 00:15:05.945
Sorry won't cut it.

223
00:15:05.945 --> 00:15:08.374
Just tell me if it's a yes or a no.

224
00:15:08.374 --> 00:15:10.685
- I'm sick of this. - I'm sorry.

225
00:15:10.685 --> 00:15:11.784
I'm really sorry.

226
00:15:11.784 --> 00:15:14.654
I said, sorry isn't enough.

227
00:15:14.855 --> 00:15:17.924
I'll take care of it somehow. Please wait.

228
00:15:19.024 --> 00:15:20.024
Gosh.

229
00:15:20.195 --> 00:15:21.624
Thank you for the food.

230
00:15:21.825 --> 00:15:23.994
Why did you invite us...

231
00:15:23.994 --> 00:15:25.994
to your home?

232
00:15:26.695 --> 00:15:28.394
We're all family.

233
00:15:29.365 --> 00:15:32.065
- Family? Family. - Family?

234
00:15:33.874 --> 00:15:36.404
I have a big announcement to make.

235
00:15:40.815 --> 00:15:43.544
I'm going to become a president.

236
00:15:46.654 --> 00:15:48.955
Are you finally getting into management?

237
00:15:49.485 --> 00:15:51.855
I'm going to leave YB for my own business.

238
00:15:52.225 --> 00:15:55.565
We can't give up on the e-sports business.

239
00:15:55.965 --> 00:15:58.725
You'll be on board with me, right?

240
00:15:58.725 --> 00:16:01.164
Join us, join us. All together.

241
00:16:04.065 --> 00:16:07.305
I know you don't trust me.

242
00:16:08.404 --> 00:16:11.744
However, I'm confident I can do this.

243
00:16:12.475 --> 00:16:16.044
In order to do that, I need you guys.

244
00:16:28.024 --> 00:16:31.565
I already promised to stay until my 100th day.

245
00:16:32.565 --> 00:16:34.294
Of course, I'm on board.

246
00:16:34.294 --> 00:16:36.164
Thank you, Ms. Wang.

247
00:16:38.034 --> 00:16:39.105
Fine.

248
00:16:39.835 --> 00:16:43.475
I'm sick of being scared about being fired.

249
00:16:44.105 --> 00:16:46.514
I'll take the risk this time.

250
00:16:46.845 --> 00:16:48.514
Will you give me...

251
00:16:49.644 --> 00:16:52.685
a director title there?

252
00:16:52.754 --> 00:16:55.185
- Yes, Director Baek. - Director?

253
00:16:55.215 --> 00:16:57.624
I'll give everyone a promotion.

254
00:16:57.654 --> 00:17:00.355
- Am I full-time now? -Do we get vacation days?

255
00:17:01.095 --> 00:17:02.294
What about a raise?

256
00:17:02.494 --> 00:17:03.595
I'm not feeling it.

257
00:17:03.624 --> 00:17:05.835
I can't give up on a big company.

258
00:17:05.835 --> 00:17:08.835
The salary and benefits will be different.

259
00:17:11.704 --> 00:17:13.174
I'm a rich man.

260
00:17:14.805 --> 00:17:18.404
I wouldn't go independent without thinking.

261
00:17:20.575 --> 00:17:22.815
I have a lot of share in YB.

262
00:17:26.355 --> 00:17:28.555
I'll do my best.

263
00:17:28.555 --> 00:17:30.355
Please help me.

264
00:17:30.684 --> 00:17:33.495
I'll work hard for you!

265
00:17:33.495 --> 00:17:36.964
- I will do my best. - Okay, okay.

266
00:17:38.495 --> 00:17:40.335
- Okay. - We got it.

267
00:17:45.434 --> 00:17:47.904
Did you delete everything...

268
00:17:47.904 --> 00:17:49.105
related to America Pictures?

269
00:17:51.904 --> 00:17:54.444
If you can't come back to being my friend,

270
00:17:55.615 --> 00:17:58.984
please return to being the great assistant,

271
00:18:01.154 --> 00:18:02.355
Ma...

272
00:18:03.285 --> 00:18:04.384
Bo...

273
00:18:05.795 --> 00:18:06.924
Na...

274
00:18:08.325 --> 00:18:09.424
from before...

275
00:18:12.595 --> 00:18:13.835
again.

276
00:18:45.224 --> 00:18:46.394
What is it?

277
00:18:53.005 --> 00:18:54.874
My lunch time is almost over.

278
00:18:55.974 --> 00:18:57.505
I have to go back.

279
00:19:02.884 --> 00:19:03.984
Here.

280
00:19:05.085 --> 00:19:06.085
What is it?

281
00:19:06.085 --> 00:19:08.815
These are documents that prove Mr. Cho...

282
00:19:08.984 --> 00:19:12.495
has been compensated by outsourcing companies.

283
00:19:13.325 --> 00:19:15.995
Mr. Nam will need these.

284
00:19:22.535 --> 00:19:24.535
- Bo Na. - Mr. Cho...

285
00:19:25.105 --> 00:19:27.134
will become the vice-president soon.

286
00:19:27.575 --> 00:19:28.805
You have to hurry.

287
00:19:29.745 --> 00:19:31.105
Will you be all right?

288
00:19:31.745 --> 00:19:35.115
If this is revealed, he'll know it was you.

289
00:19:35.944 --> 00:19:38.144
It will be hard to find another assistant job.

290
00:19:40.855 --> 00:19:42.424
It doesn't matter anymore.

291
00:19:43.884 --> 00:19:45.694
I should have done it earlier.

292
00:19:46.555 --> 00:19:48.025
I'm sorry I'm late.

293
00:19:53.664 --> 00:19:54.734
Right.

294
00:19:55.835 --> 00:19:57.035
Yoon Yi.

295
00:19:58.404 --> 00:20:00.174
I actually...

296
00:20:02.105 --> 00:20:04.805
- You and Mr. Nam's... - No.

297
00:20:05.615 --> 00:20:07.245
Let's talk about that later.

298
00:20:07.615 --> 00:20:09.615
A lot later.

299
00:20:14.755 --> 00:20:18.724
I won't be able to become...

300
00:20:18.724 --> 00:20:20.394
a great assistant again,

301
00:20:21.154 --> 00:20:23.124
but would it be too late...

302
00:20:23.924 --> 00:20:27.434
to go back to being your friend?

303
00:20:29.565 --> 00:20:32.204
You were never...

304
00:20:34.204 --> 00:20:35.904
not my friend.

305
00:20:43.585 --> 00:20:44.615
Mr. Nam.

306
00:20:47.515 --> 00:20:48.954
Why didn't you courier it?

307
00:20:49.285 --> 00:20:52.154
What if something happens? It's important.

308
00:20:52.424 --> 00:20:53.595
Here.

309
00:20:55.255 --> 00:20:56.394
Thank you.

310
00:20:56.495 --> 00:20:58.464
Wait. My friend...

311
00:20:58.464 --> 00:21:01.234
gave up everything to give this to us, so...

312
00:21:01.234 --> 00:21:04.234
I got it. I'll make it happen.

313
00:21:04.464 --> 00:21:05.575
Okay.

314
00:21:10.245 --> 00:21:13.174
Okay. This is the proof we have been looking for.

315
00:21:13.615 --> 00:21:17.184
Make it into a video and print a report.

316
00:21:17.644 --> 00:21:19.585
- Yes, sir. - Okay, hurry.

317
00:21:20.015 --> 00:21:21.355
- To the conference room! - Okay.

318
00:21:21.355 --> 00:21:23.684
- Bring the documents. - Okay.

319
00:21:32.495 --> 00:21:34.295
What is this?

320
00:21:34.394 --> 00:21:36.234
You said before,

321
00:21:37.434 --> 00:21:39.005
that one day, I'll have to choose...

322
00:21:39.005 --> 00:21:40.835
between friendship and success.

323
00:21:42.105 --> 00:21:44.644
This is what I choose.

324
00:21:46.974 --> 00:21:49.345
Why are you suddenly doing this?

325
00:21:50.015 --> 00:21:51.644
Don't you know I was nominated for VP?

326
00:21:51.644 --> 00:21:53.315
Don't you want to be the VP's assistant?

327
00:21:54.484 --> 00:21:58.424
There was a time when I respected you...

328
00:21:58.684 --> 00:22:01.124
for getting here purely on your hard work.

329
00:22:01.595 --> 00:22:04.495
I realized that you began taking the wrong path,

330
00:22:04.964 --> 00:22:06.095
but I didn't stop it,

331
00:22:06.265 --> 00:22:08.434
but rather, helped you. That was my fault.

332
00:22:09.134 --> 00:22:10.265
It's belated,

333
00:22:10.265 --> 00:22:12.775
but I believe it is my last duty...

334
00:22:13.305 --> 00:22:14.575
as your assistant...

335
00:22:14.575 --> 00:22:16.644
to make you stop.

336
00:22:20.174 --> 00:22:23.914
Don't... Don't tell me you'll go to Nam...

337
00:22:26.684 --> 00:22:28.115
Hey, Ms. Ma.

338
00:22:35.055 --> 00:22:36.124
Hey, Ms. Ma.

339
00:22:36.724 --> 00:22:39.565
If you leave now, your career's over!

340
00:22:40.495 --> 00:22:42.634
Do you think your career can survive...

341
00:22:42.634 --> 00:22:44.865
after stabbing me in the back?

342
00:22:51.275 --> 00:22:53.714
(Line 2)

343
00:22:53.714 --> 00:22:55.015
(Calling Line 2)

344
00:23:03.755 --> 00:23:05.555
It has all the phrases that we need.

345
00:23:05.555 --> 00:23:06.555
Mr. Nam.

346
00:23:08.355 --> 00:23:10.124
Please confirm this.

347
00:23:10.565 --> 00:23:11.565
Here.

348
00:23:11.565 --> 00:23:13.394
- Is this the one? - Yes.

349
00:23:14.095 --> 00:23:15.095
Just a minute.

350
00:23:26.914 --> 00:23:28.374
Ta-da.

351
00:23:28.374 --> 00:23:29.914
Take a break.

352
00:23:29.914 --> 00:23:32.454
- Yoon Yi! - Food!

353
00:23:32.454 --> 00:23:35.414
- We've missed you! - Hi!

354
00:23:35.414 --> 00:23:36.424
Hold on.

355
00:23:36.424 --> 00:23:38.325
Meet our boss, Mr. Nam Chi Won.

356
00:23:39.224 --> 00:23:40.495
Here you go.

357
00:23:40.495 --> 00:23:42.365
- Thank you. - Sure.

358
00:23:42.595 --> 00:23:43.894
- Hang in there. - Thanks.

359
00:23:43.894 --> 00:23:44.894
Hae Jin.

360
00:23:44.894 --> 00:23:46.535
Take this and hang in there.

361
00:23:46.535 --> 00:23:47.535
Thank you.

362
00:23:48.194 --> 00:23:50.704
- Here's the document. - Thanks.

363
00:23:51.035 --> 00:23:52.234
Wake up.

364
00:23:54.474 --> 00:23:56.904
Mr. Gong. Hang in there.

365
00:23:59.414 --> 00:24:01.575
Mr. Nam. Here are some pencils.

366
00:24:03.545 --> 00:24:04.545
Thank you.

367
00:24:08.515 --> 00:24:10.124
- Let's work. - Yes, sir.

368
00:24:17.295 --> 00:24:18.325
I think...

369
00:24:19.434 --> 00:24:20.434
we're done.

370
00:24:20.434 --> 00:24:22.234
- Okay! - Yes!

371
00:24:24.505 --> 00:24:27.234
Let's stop here for today.

372
00:24:27.234 --> 00:24:29.874
Let's come in early and do a final check.

373
00:24:29.874 --> 00:24:31.805
- Yes, sir. - Good work!

374
00:24:31.805 --> 00:24:33.174
- Good work! - Good work!

375
00:24:33.174 --> 00:24:34.444
- Good work! - Good work!

376
00:24:34.444 --> 00:24:36.484
- Good work! - It's finally over!

377
00:24:36.484 --> 00:24:38.745
- Good work. - Good, good.

378
00:24:38.745 --> 00:24:39.884
- Good work. - Thank you.

379
00:24:39.884 --> 00:24:42.115
- Let's go home. - Yes.

380
00:24:42.115 --> 00:24:43.585
You all did great.

381
00:24:45.624 --> 00:24:46.855
Let's go.

382
00:24:46.855 --> 00:24:49.065
- Elevator! - Stop it.

383
00:24:52.095 --> 00:24:53.664
- Shall we? - Sure.

384
00:24:58.265 --> 00:25:01.075
Tomorrow is finally D-day.

385
00:25:01.835 --> 00:25:03.745
We shouldn't have any more problems, right?

386
00:25:04.974 --> 00:25:06.275
Hopefully not.

387
00:25:08.545 --> 00:25:10.414
Everything will be back to normal.

388
00:25:22.325 --> 00:25:25.095
(Work Log)

389
00:25:58.664 --> 00:26:01.095
I was nominated to be the new VP.

390
00:26:01.095 --> 00:26:03.035
We'll announce who will be dissolved,

391
00:26:03.035 --> 00:26:04.964
and cut Chi Won...

392
00:26:04.964 --> 00:26:06.674
and all of his little minions.

393
00:26:06.674 --> 00:26:09.605
I should dress up on such an occasion.

394
00:26:12.144 --> 00:26:13.144
Don't you agree?

395
00:26:16.214 --> 00:26:18.315
Yes, sir. It looks great on you.

396
00:26:19.384 --> 00:26:21.355
You chose right.

397
00:26:21.355 --> 00:26:22.755
Even if Do Tae Geun retires,

398
00:26:22.755 --> 00:26:25.124
you'll survive thanks to me.

399
00:26:25.454 --> 00:26:26.795
But...

400
00:26:26.954 --> 00:26:29.224
Line 2 played a huge part last night.

401
00:26:29.224 --> 00:26:30.664
Of course.

402
00:26:30.964 --> 00:26:32.765
Line 2 is a fast stone.

403
00:26:33.835 --> 00:26:35.365
We all worked hard.

404
00:26:35.904 --> 00:26:37.305
Let's get steak together.

405
00:26:38.234 --> 00:26:39.234
Salute!

406
00:26:40.634 --> 00:26:41.634
At ease.

407
00:26:46.275 --> 00:26:48.745
Nam Chi Won must be running late today.

408
00:26:49.515 --> 00:26:51.484
He must've known he'd be fired today,

409
00:26:51.484 --> 00:26:52.815
and ran away.

410
00:26:54.714 --> 00:26:57.154
Okay, this will be the last meeting...

411
00:26:57.154 --> 00:26:59.424
that I oversee.

412
00:27:01.325 --> 00:27:03.365
Cho Sang Moo,

413
00:27:03.365 --> 00:27:06.365
who was named the next Vice President.

414
00:27:06.795 --> 00:27:07.865
Yes!

415
00:27:09.535 --> 00:27:11.305
How about a speech?

416
00:27:11.305 --> 00:27:14.904
Come on. I wasn't officially appointed yet.

417
00:27:14.904 --> 00:27:16.204
What speech?

418
00:27:16.204 --> 00:27:18.374
Perhaps this in my pocket.

419
00:27:22.444 --> 00:27:24.384
"My dear colleagues."

420
00:27:24.984 --> 00:27:28.015
"I, Cho Sang Moo, after being appointed..."

421
00:27:28.515 --> 00:27:30.484
"Vice President recently,"

422
00:27:30.484 --> 00:27:32.595
"feel a great sense of duty..."

423
00:27:32.595 --> 00:27:34.555
"as I stand here today."

424
00:27:38.194 --> 00:27:39.694
I'm sorry to interrupt.

425
00:27:40.134 --> 00:27:43.305
I've prepared a special video for the chairman,

426
00:27:43.865 --> 00:27:45.404
and he said it was so interesting,

427
00:27:47.474 --> 00:27:49.005
that you should all watch it.

428
00:27:54.745 --> 00:27:56.444
Cho Sang Mo, that rat,

429
00:27:56.845 --> 00:27:58.615
threatens to eliminate me...

430
00:27:58.615 --> 00:28:00.085
from the advertising industry...

431
00:28:00.085 --> 00:28:01.954
if I don't give him gift certificates.

432
00:28:02.355 --> 00:28:03.424
It isn't just us.

433
00:28:03.424 --> 00:28:05.795
I'm sure other companies get threatened too.

434
00:28:06.525 --> 00:28:07.995
If you don't do what he wants,

435
00:28:07.995 --> 00:28:10.495
he'll eliminate you from the bidding war.

436
00:28:11.295 --> 00:28:13.934
Contractors like us have no power.

437
00:28:14.134 --> 00:28:16.065
Mr. Cho gives us work, so he's in power.

438
00:28:16.065 --> 00:28:17.765
We have to do what he says.

439
00:28:18.535 --> 00:28:20.374
Just consider it inflated costs...

440
00:28:20.374 --> 00:28:22.075
that goes into the bid.

441
00:28:22.374 --> 00:28:23.444
He demands rebates,

442
00:28:23.904 --> 00:28:27.144
saying it's customary, and threatens us.

443
00:28:27.315 --> 00:28:30.245
- Even if it's unfair, - What is this?

444
00:28:30.315 --> 00:28:32.654
- we have no choice. - What's going on?

445
00:28:33.184 --> 00:28:37.884
(Last Night)

446
00:28:39.124 --> 00:28:40.255
Did you get everything?

447
00:28:47.765 --> 00:28:49.164
Yoon Yi was right.

448
00:28:49.404 --> 00:28:50.505
Naturally,

449
00:28:50.505 --> 00:28:52.674
Mr. Cho's lines would act on a day like this.

450
00:28:52.934 --> 00:28:54.474
Did you think we had left?

451
00:28:54.474 --> 00:28:57.075
So, show us your face.

452
00:29:00.275 --> 00:29:01.345
- What? - Ms. Koo.

453
00:29:01.345 --> 00:29:02.684
Gye Young.

454
00:29:16.325 --> 00:29:17.825
I'm sorry.

455
00:29:20.565 --> 00:29:22.164
I'm so sorry.

456
00:29:26.005 --> 00:29:27.275
My contract...

457
00:29:28.005 --> 00:29:29.075
with the company...

458
00:29:29.374 --> 00:29:31.674
was expiring soon, and...

459
00:29:33.444 --> 00:29:35.815
I had to pay off my family's debt...

460
00:29:39.315 --> 00:29:41.515
And right then, Mr. Cho...

461
00:29:42.954 --> 00:29:44.884
Only we know what happened today.

462
00:29:48.694 --> 00:29:50.365
We'll let VP Hwangbo...

463
00:29:50.724 --> 00:29:52.995
decide what to do with you.

464
00:29:54.464 --> 00:29:55.904
Do you understand?

465
00:29:56.565 --> 00:29:57.835
- Yes. - But...

466
00:29:58.974 --> 00:30:01.005
you need to do something for us.

467
00:30:05.914 --> 00:30:07.115
That punk...

468
00:30:08.515 --> 00:30:09.515
Hey.

469
00:30:09.984 --> 00:30:12.085
This is all fake. It's a lie.

470
00:30:12.615 --> 00:30:14.914
It's been fabricated!

471
00:30:14.914 --> 00:30:17.384
Stop your stupid antics.

472
00:30:17.624 --> 00:30:18.785
Get out.

473
00:30:18.785 --> 00:30:20.724
Get out. Get out, you jerk!

474
00:30:20.724 --> 00:30:22.394
We're with the audit team.

475
00:30:22.394 --> 00:30:24.025
Please come with us.

476
00:30:25.124 --> 00:30:26.765
Are you kidding me?

477
00:30:26.765 --> 00:30:28.835
Let go. Let go! I'm...

478
00:30:28.835 --> 00:30:31.204
Hey. Mr. Yoo. What's going on?

479
00:30:31.204 --> 00:30:33.305
Line One. Handle this, you jerk!

480
00:30:33.305 --> 00:30:34.974
What's going on? Let go!

481
00:30:34.974 --> 00:30:36.775
Hey. Let go. Let go!

482
00:30:36.775 --> 00:30:38.874
- Come with us. - Let go, you jerk.

483
00:30:38.874 --> 00:30:41.845
Let go. Hey. Let go!

484
00:30:41.845 --> 00:30:42.914
Mr. Do!

485
00:30:43.585 --> 00:30:46.085
Let go, you jerk!

486
00:30:46.085 --> 00:30:48.684
Let go. Let go already!

487
00:30:50.484 --> 00:30:51.654
I warned you...

488
00:30:51.654 --> 00:30:53.224
not to touch Yoon Yi.

489
00:30:53.624 --> 00:30:54.654
Second warning.

490
00:30:54.654 --> 00:30:55.765
You're being sent off.

491
00:31:00.234 --> 00:31:02.865
Hey. Let go. I have to get him.

492
00:31:02.865 --> 00:31:04.204
Let go!

493
00:31:04.204 --> 00:31:05.974
How amusing.

494
00:31:05.974 --> 00:31:07.535
The villain's final moment.

495
00:31:11.105 --> 00:31:12.714
Once I quit,

496
00:31:12.714 --> 00:31:14.775
I can't watch these fun scenes.

497
00:31:14.815 --> 00:31:15.984
What a shame.

498
00:31:17.714 --> 00:31:20.585
I'm sure Mr. Cho wasn't bad from the start.

499
00:31:36.964 --> 00:31:38.105
Mr. Nam.

500
00:31:54.615 --> 00:31:56.184
I kept my promise.

501
00:31:56.785 --> 00:31:58.995
- Not yet, you didn't. - What?

502
00:32:00.124 --> 00:32:02.924
You need to move back home, Mr. Tenant.

503
00:32:06.565 --> 00:32:09.765
I'll be better. Live with me longer.

504
00:32:12.065 --> 00:32:14.634
You don't need to keep these rules.

505
00:32:15.005 --> 00:32:17.674
The track suit? Don't wear it. It's childish.

506
00:32:18.944 --> 00:32:21.315
I'll do all the chores too.

507
00:32:24.484 --> 00:32:26.355
Why are you so clingy? You're being gross.

508
00:32:26.515 --> 00:32:29.855
If you leave, I'll be bored all by myself.

509
00:32:32.894 --> 00:32:35.924
My landlord is bored without me too.

510
00:32:38.194 --> 00:32:41.035
Fine. Go to Gapsoon.

511
00:32:41.765 --> 00:32:42.865
I was always...

512
00:32:43.035 --> 00:32:45.874
alone, lonely, and lonesome.

513
00:32:47.674 --> 00:32:49.474
Once I quit work,

514
00:32:49.944 --> 00:32:52.045
we won't see each other at all.

515
00:32:57.015 --> 00:32:58.585
Your big brother will come over to play.

516
00:33:02.255 --> 00:33:03.855
- Big brother? - That's right.

517
00:33:04.384 --> 00:33:07.795
You won't be my superior anymore, and I'm older.

518
00:33:08.694 --> 00:33:09.724
So...

519
00:33:11.365 --> 00:33:12.734
I'll be like your big brother.

520
00:33:14.234 --> 00:33:17.005
I finally get to hear you say that.

521
00:33:20.234 --> 00:33:21.575
Bye, Tail.

522
00:33:25.545 --> 00:33:26.874
You close the door.

523
00:33:28.075 --> 00:33:30.884
Big Bro! Tail will be waiting!

524
00:33:31.115 --> 00:33:34.714
I was happy! Goodbye!

525
00:33:36.454 --> 00:33:38.184
Gross. So gross.

526
00:33:39.154 --> 00:33:40.394
Bye!

527
00:33:45.495 --> 00:33:46.694
What's with the steak?

528
00:33:47.765 --> 00:33:50.565
You returned home, and I to the video department.

529
00:33:50.704 --> 00:33:53.105
It's a party to celebrate both of our return!

530
00:33:54.775 --> 00:33:56.805
- I like your menu choice. - Right?

531
00:33:58.204 --> 00:33:59.674
Because you don't need to season it.

532
00:34:00.245 --> 00:34:03.815
How do you like it? Medium? Rare?

533
00:34:04.115 --> 00:34:06.654
Or well done?

534
00:34:06.654 --> 00:34:09.225
- What would you like? - Medium well...

535
00:34:10.625 --> 00:34:13.424
Fire. Be careful...

536
00:34:15.865 --> 00:34:17.095
Are you okay?

537
00:34:18.125 --> 00:34:21.334
Are you okay? The flames came this high.

538
00:34:21.665 --> 00:34:24.365
You're right. Why am I okay?

539
00:34:27.004 --> 00:34:28.604
Maybe it's because you're with me.

540
00:34:30.645 --> 00:34:33.174
Then you'll have to stay with me forever.

541
00:34:48.198 --> 00:34:53.198
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E16 Jugglers "Whatever It is We Want, We'll Get It"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

542
00:35:09.285 --> 00:35:10.584
Hold on.

543
00:35:16.354 --> 00:35:17.384
Hold on.

544
00:35:18.725 --> 00:35:20.955
- Hold on. - Wait.

545
00:35:22.125 --> 00:35:23.924
- Mr. Nam. - Are you okay?

546
00:36:10.205 --> 00:36:12.075
Why do you like...

547
00:36:13.814 --> 00:36:16.115
someone with so many scars like me?

548
00:36:16.615 --> 00:36:19.185
There are plenty of normal people around you.

549
00:36:19.654 --> 00:36:20.955
How stupid.

550
00:36:21.354 --> 00:36:23.725
There's no "normal" person.

551
00:36:25.225 --> 00:36:27.294
Everyone just acts that way.

552
00:36:29.665 --> 00:36:31.125
You...

553
00:36:32.095 --> 00:36:33.435
are special.

554
00:36:35.265 --> 00:36:39.234
You are very special to me.

555
00:36:40.375 --> 00:36:41.535
Thanks...

556
00:36:48.415 --> 00:36:50.245
for cherishing someone like me.

557
00:37:20.245 --> 00:37:22.214
Hello.

558
00:37:28.884 --> 00:37:31.154
What brings you here?

559
00:37:33.794 --> 00:37:36.395
I'm at a salon. I came to do my hair.

560
00:37:36.694 --> 00:37:38.564
All the way from Seoul?

561
00:37:38.665 --> 00:37:39.734
Yes.

562
00:37:39.834 --> 00:37:43.064
Your skills are well-known even in Seoul.

563
00:37:58.345 --> 00:37:59.915
You have a pretty head.

564
00:38:00.515 --> 00:38:01.955
Thank you.

565
00:38:02.584 --> 00:38:05.325
If you look carefully,

566
00:38:05.754 --> 00:38:08.055
other parts are pretty too.

567
00:38:09.895 --> 00:38:11.325
You're cheeky too.

568
00:38:12.265 --> 00:38:15.634
I'll wait until you grow to like me.

569
00:38:18.834 --> 00:38:20.604
What is this?

570
00:38:21.504 --> 00:38:22.705
What is this?

571
00:38:22.705 --> 00:38:24.274
- What... - You have two parts.

572
00:38:24.404 --> 00:38:25.645
I have two parts?

573
00:38:25.674 --> 00:38:28.884
Why do you have to have two parts?

574
00:38:28.884 --> 00:38:31.484
- Seriously. - Do I?

575
00:38:33.084 --> 00:38:36.984
My hair grows quickly. That's probably why...

576
00:38:37.024 --> 00:38:40.254
it probably just looks like I have two parts.

577
00:38:42.524 --> 00:38:45.524
Still, I'll come often,

578
00:38:46.634 --> 00:38:48.095
so please look kindly upon me,

579
00:38:49.365 --> 00:38:50.435
Mother.

580
00:38:53.875 --> 00:38:55.575
Do you want some product in your hair?

581
00:38:56.544 --> 00:38:57.604
Yes, please.

582
00:38:58.174 --> 00:39:00.044
Make me look good.

583
00:39:17.495 --> 00:39:18.725
All done.

584
00:39:27.134 --> 00:39:28.705
Wow. It looks great.

585
00:39:30.604 --> 00:39:31.904
Thank you.

586
00:39:31.944 --> 00:39:33.075
Mom.

587
00:39:36.714 --> 00:39:37.944
Chi... Chi Won.

588
00:39:39.084 --> 00:39:41.984
What happened to your hair?

589
00:39:44.484 --> 00:39:47.625
Tae Yi, bring your resume to my office tomorrow.

590
00:39:48.194 --> 00:39:49.265
Do you mean it?

591
00:39:52.395 --> 00:39:53.694
Thank you!

592
00:39:55.395 --> 00:39:56.834
Mother, I'll...

593
00:39:57.165 --> 00:39:59.674
I'll go now for today.

594
00:40:00.375 --> 00:40:01.475
Thank you.

595
00:40:06.774 --> 00:40:08.575
Eat...

596
00:40:10.285 --> 00:40:12.015
Why don't you eat first?

597
00:40:14.314 --> 00:40:16.854
May I really?

598
00:40:25.325 --> 00:40:26.395
Automatic!

599
00:40:29.734 --> 00:40:30.865
Hello.

600
00:40:31.535 --> 00:40:34.274
I'm finally a YB person.

601
00:40:37.274 --> 00:40:38.375
Chi Won!

602
00:40:44.584 --> 00:40:45.785
Hello.

603
00:40:48.285 --> 00:40:49.384
Won't you be uncomfortable?

604
00:40:50.584 --> 00:40:52.825
First impressions are critical.

605
00:40:52.825 --> 00:40:56.125
A YB intern should dress the part.

606
00:40:56.895 --> 00:40:58.225
- Follow me. - Okay.

607
00:40:58.464 --> 00:41:01.634
So, do I call you "Mr. Nam" now?

608
00:41:01.634 --> 00:41:02.765
Hello.

609
00:41:03.865 --> 00:41:05.035
Chi Won.

610
00:41:05.404 --> 00:41:08.604
Isn't your office this way?

611
00:41:10.705 --> 00:41:11.944
It's this way.

612
00:41:12.044 --> 00:41:13.145
Come here.

613
00:41:13.714 --> 00:41:15.345
Come here.

614
00:41:15.345 --> 00:41:17.084
- Why... - Hurry up.

615
00:41:24.185 --> 00:41:26.424
The sign says you're hiring a part-timer.

616
00:41:26.424 --> 00:41:28.555
I wanted to recommend him.

617
00:41:30.595 --> 00:41:31.694
Chi Won.

618
00:41:32.435 --> 00:41:35.834
You weren't giving me an internship at YB?

619
00:41:39.435 --> 00:41:40.435
Here.

620
00:41:42.444 --> 00:41:43.705
What is this?

621
00:41:43.944 --> 00:41:46.145
It's my letter of recommendation.

622
00:41:46.214 --> 00:41:47.745
A letter...

623
00:41:48.615 --> 00:41:50.944
I'll check every day...

624
00:41:50.944 --> 00:41:53.785
to see if you work hard for six months, okay?

625
00:41:53.785 --> 00:41:55.185
Six months?

626
00:41:56.725 --> 00:41:57.884
I'm busy, so...

627
00:41:57.884 --> 00:41:59.455
Please look after him.

628
00:41:59.455 --> 00:42:02.725
- Wait. Wait... - Chi... Chi Won!

629
00:42:04.064 --> 00:42:05.265
Darn it.

630
00:42:05.865 --> 00:42:07.535
I bragged to all my friends...

631
00:42:07.535 --> 00:42:09.205
that I was interning at YB.

632
00:42:09.205 --> 00:42:12.305
You're not good enough even to be a part-timer,

633
00:42:12.305 --> 00:42:13.334
but what? An intern?

634
00:42:14.104 --> 00:42:16.205
Watch it. Attention!

635
00:42:17.805 --> 00:42:18.845
Salute.

636
00:42:21.944 --> 00:42:24.685
Good. Let's go.

637
00:42:25.444 --> 00:42:26.814
Let's go.

638
00:42:26.814 --> 00:42:29.125
- Put on your apron. - Shoot.

639
00:42:29.384 --> 00:42:31.384
- Thanks for everything. - Thank you.

640
00:42:31.455 --> 00:42:33.754
- Thanks for everything. - Thank you.

641
00:42:33.754 --> 00:42:34.854
- Thank you. - Thank you.

642
00:42:34.854 --> 00:42:36.995
- Thank you. - Thanks.

643
00:42:41.435 --> 00:42:44.004
Hey. How do you like my outfit?

644
00:42:48.134 --> 00:42:49.944
Are you really going to ride that?

645
00:43:14.294 --> 00:43:16.504
Sir. She's my number one prized possession,

646
00:43:16.504 --> 00:43:17.865
so please...

647
00:43:17.865 --> 00:43:19.834
ride it carefully and slowly.

648
00:43:20.634 --> 00:43:22.375
Is that his retirement gift?

649
00:43:24.075 --> 00:43:25.174
Here's the money for the bike.

650
00:43:25.345 --> 00:43:26.575
Thank you.

651
00:43:29.044 --> 00:43:30.044
It...

652
00:43:30.285 --> 00:43:33.384
costs a lot to start a new company.

653
00:43:35.584 --> 00:43:37.455
But still, I'm proud of you.

654
00:43:37.754 --> 00:43:40.325
- Good luck. - Thank you. Come visit.

655
00:43:45.095 --> 00:43:47.035
Please take good care of yourself.

656
00:43:48.964 --> 00:43:51.464
You made him appear human...

657
00:43:51.464 --> 00:43:53.234
and made him a senior managing director.

658
00:43:53.575 --> 00:43:55.075
You're impressive.

659
00:44:03.484 --> 00:44:05.384
I'll play with you often, Uncle.

660
00:44:24.504 --> 00:44:25.504
Bye!

661
00:44:40.584 --> 00:44:43.024
So this is a foam mask.

662
00:44:43.354 --> 00:44:46.495
We don't have to wash it off, right?

663
00:44:47.194 --> 00:44:48.194
Here.

664
00:44:54.234 --> 00:44:55.705
Hey, Bo Na.

665
00:44:55.705 --> 00:44:58.035
How did your interview go?

666
00:44:59.375 --> 00:45:01.134
I didn't get it again.

667
00:45:01.734 --> 00:45:04.805
I'm thinking about switching careers.

668
00:45:04.975 --> 00:45:06.015
To what?

669
00:45:08.444 --> 00:45:09.685
Announcer?

670
00:45:10.645 --> 00:45:11.915
- Hey. - Don't even.

671
00:45:11.915 --> 00:45:14.084
No way. You're no announcer.

672
00:45:15.884 --> 00:45:17.125
If you can't get a job,

673
00:45:17.125 --> 00:45:18.725
come work for me.

674
00:45:19.455 --> 00:45:20.895
That's right.

675
00:45:20.895 --> 00:45:22.395
You're the best among us.

676
00:45:22.395 --> 00:45:24.225
Our CEO!

677
00:45:24.294 --> 00:45:26.634
I'm the best

678
00:45:30.205 --> 00:45:32.375
The coffee cart at drama sets...

679
00:45:32.375 --> 00:45:35.334
are very lucrative right now.

680
00:45:35.334 --> 00:45:37.745
Really? That's good.

681
00:45:38.174 --> 00:45:41.375
Get moisturized.

682
00:45:41.375 --> 00:45:43.884
- What? - Get moisturized.

683
00:45:45.044 --> 00:45:46.285
(Jugglers, Thanks for your hard work.)

684
00:45:46.285 --> 00:45:47.515
I'm taking a break.

685
00:45:47.515 --> 00:45:49.125
Why you little...

686
00:45:50.685 --> 00:45:52.055
Thank you.

687
00:45:52.055 --> 00:45:53.455
Thank you.

688
00:45:53.694 --> 00:45:55.895
Just a minute please.

689
00:45:55.895 --> 00:45:56.895
Okay.

690
00:45:56.895 --> 00:45:58.194
(From In Gyo Jin with love)

691
00:46:03.104 --> 00:46:04.435
- Hey. - Yes?

692
00:46:07.535 --> 00:46:09.904
Awesome. Aren't you In Gyo Jin?

693
00:46:10.274 --> 00:46:11.944
I'm a huge fan.

694
00:46:11.944 --> 00:46:13.444
May I shake your hand?

695
00:46:13.444 --> 00:46:14.444
Here.

696
00:46:14.814 --> 00:46:16.214
Do you want a picture?

697
00:46:16.745 --> 00:46:18.084
That's fine.

698
00:46:18.115 --> 00:46:21.685
Wow. But you look a lot like someone I know.

699
00:46:21.915 --> 00:46:23.484
I don't have a common face.

700
00:46:23.484 --> 00:46:24.884
His name is Cho Cutter.

701
00:46:26.024 --> 00:46:28.194
He's in prison.

702
00:46:29.064 --> 00:46:30.095
In jail?

703
00:46:33.134 --> 00:46:34.634
Bean and barley latte, please.

704
00:46:34.634 --> 00:46:35.935
We're sold out.

705
00:46:36.035 --> 00:46:37.305
Jesus.

706
00:46:39.604 --> 00:46:40.904
Amen.

707
00:46:49.415 --> 00:46:50.515
Mr. Cho.

708
00:46:51.944 --> 00:46:53.814
You resented me a lot, didn't you?

709
00:46:53.915 --> 00:46:55.785
I don't resent you.

710
00:46:56.984 --> 00:46:58.455
But seeing you dressed like this,

711
00:46:59.524 --> 00:47:01.455
it is a bit embarrassing.

712
00:47:08.395 --> 00:47:09.464
I've been...

713
00:47:09.834 --> 00:47:11.805
repenting a lot lately.

714
00:47:13.075 --> 00:47:15.975
I've been reading the Word of Life,

715
00:47:16.305 --> 00:47:17.645
and being reborn.

716
00:47:18.805 --> 00:47:20.174
I'm glad.

717
00:47:23.845 --> 00:47:27.214
I got your cell phone back from the auditing team.

718
00:47:27.785 --> 00:47:30.725
You used to watch this video every day.

719
00:47:45.205 --> 00:47:46.734
Sang Moo...

720
00:47:47.834 --> 00:47:49.444
My dear Sang Moo...

721
00:47:51.274 --> 00:47:53.145
I should see you become...

722
00:47:53.475 --> 00:47:55.584
a senior managing director before I go...

723
00:48:00.685 --> 00:48:01.854
Sang Moo.

724
00:48:02.884 --> 00:48:05.625
Don't just work all the time.

725
00:48:07.154 --> 00:48:10.725
Make sure you eat well, okay?

726
00:48:15.334 --> 00:48:17.964
All she ever talks about is eating...

727
00:48:29.214 --> 00:48:30.384
Darn it.

728
00:48:32.654 --> 00:48:35.455
I should've just stopped once I hit senior MD.

729
00:48:38.024 --> 00:48:40.254
I shouldn't have gotten greedy.

730
00:48:44.464 --> 00:48:45.794
I miss my mom.

731
00:48:48.035 --> 00:48:50.234
When you were a senior managing director,

732
00:48:50.234 --> 00:48:52.805
you were super cool.

733
00:48:53.875 --> 00:48:55.174
You were my role model.

734
00:48:55.174 --> 00:48:56.544
Stop it.

735
00:48:57.504 --> 00:48:59.645
It's all in the past.

736
00:49:00.575 --> 00:49:01.944
We worked overtime...

737
00:49:01.944 --> 00:49:03.944
and late into the night every day,

738
00:49:04.915 --> 00:49:07.384
but I was the happiest then.

739
00:49:11.854 --> 00:49:14.194
Whether it's skills and work performance,

740
00:49:15.294 --> 00:49:16.924
or people skills,

741
00:49:17.495 --> 00:49:19.794
Ma Bo Na is the best..

742
00:49:23.634 --> 00:49:24.634
Bo Na,

743
00:49:25.634 --> 00:49:27.904
hang in there.

744
00:49:28.305 --> 00:49:29.705
You'll get a job again.

745
00:49:30.104 --> 00:49:31.604
I'll pray every morning...

746
00:49:32.274 --> 00:49:34.645
that your next boss...

747
00:49:34.645 --> 00:49:36.484
will be a good person.

748
00:49:38.484 --> 00:49:39.955
I believe.

749
00:49:41.354 --> 00:49:42.354
Okay.

750
00:49:42.354 --> 00:49:43.924
Time's up.

751
00:49:45.825 --> 00:49:46.825
Darn it!

752
00:49:48.095 --> 00:49:51.725
How dare you try to cut Cho Cutter's time?

753
00:49:53.095 --> 00:49:54.134
Ms. Ma.

754
00:49:56.004 --> 00:49:57.035
Go home.

755
00:49:58.134 --> 00:49:59.375
I'll go too.

756
00:50:09.345 --> 00:50:11.745
(Queen's Knights! Aim for the First Win!)

757
00:50:21.955 --> 00:50:25.694
Guys, don't just surf the web.

758
00:50:25.694 --> 00:50:27.765
Practice playing.

759
00:50:27.964 --> 00:50:29.464
Let's have the Queen's Knights...

760
00:50:29.464 --> 00:50:31.765
win at least one match.

761
00:50:31.765 --> 00:50:34.774
I'm dying to perm my hair.

762
00:50:36.805 --> 00:50:39.714
The printer broke again!

763
00:50:39.714 --> 00:50:40.774
Again?

764
00:50:41.645 --> 00:50:44.314
Mr. Baek. What if we close shop in a month...

765
00:50:44.314 --> 00:50:46.015
before we even get a single win?

766
00:50:46.015 --> 00:50:47.015
She's right.

767
00:50:47.015 --> 00:50:49.524
How is a corporate heir's company like this?

768
00:50:49.524 --> 00:50:53.395
Didn't our CEO say he had shares of YB?

769
00:50:54.354 --> 00:50:55.665
Yes, he did,

770
00:50:55.665 --> 00:50:58.765
but he didn't say how many shares he had.

771
00:51:00.165 --> 00:51:02.334
I knew he was low on the totem pole,

772
00:51:02.734 --> 00:51:05.165
but I didn't know he'd be this poor.

773
00:51:05.205 --> 00:51:06.375
Ms. Koo!

774
00:51:06.875 --> 00:51:08.575
- Ms. Koo! - Yes?

775
00:51:13.714 --> 00:51:15.615
She's working so hard.

776
00:51:16.185 --> 00:51:17.615
Bathroom run.

777
00:51:18.145 --> 00:51:20.814
(CEO Hwangbo Yool)

778
00:51:27.895 --> 00:51:29.625
Here's your coffee, sir.

779
00:51:30.095 --> 00:51:31.865
Darn it.

780
00:51:32.234 --> 00:51:34.634
What took you so long to make coffee?

781
00:51:37.734 --> 00:51:40.875
Where's the whipped cream? I said I wanted this much.

782
00:51:40.875 --> 00:51:44.805
Sir. You must still think you're at YB,

783
00:51:44.975 --> 00:51:47.915
but you should be happy to have instant coffee.

784
00:51:51.645 --> 00:51:53.415
- Hey, Ms. Koo. - Yes, sir?

785
00:51:53.415 --> 00:51:55.924
Are you lecturing me?

786
00:51:56.424 --> 00:51:57.924
Is that how Mr. Cho taught you?

787
00:51:58.484 --> 00:52:01.354
Did you forget you signed a 20-year contract?

788
00:52:03.964 --> 00:52:07.665
You have 19 years and 6 months to go.

789
00:52:07.995 --> 00:52:09.705
I... I'm sorry, sir.

790
00:52:13.435 --> 00:52:16.075
I'm sorry, I'm late. My class ended late.

791
00:52:16.104 --> 00:52:17.305
Ms. Wang!

792
00:52:17.805 --> 00:52:19.975
Why are you so late?

793
00:52:24.884 --> 00:52:26.915
If only I hadn't become Mr. Cho's spy...

794
00:52:30.125 --> 00:52:33.225
- Ms. Wang. The printer... - Ms. Wang...

795
00:52:37.964 --> 00:52:39.095
Yes!

796
00:52:41.665 --> 00:52:43.634
Can you find the report?

797
00:52:43.935 --> 00:52:45.004
Okay.

798
00:52:54.745 --> 00:52:55.785
Mr. Baek.

799
00:52:56.015 --> 00:52:58.814
I just sent you the list of this month's new games.

800
00:52:59.654 --> 00:53:00.714
Okay.

801
00:53:04.084 --> 00:53:05.484
Ms. Wang! We're dead!

802
00:53:05.625 --> 00:53:07.524
Our coach left again!

803
00:53:07.895 --> 00:53:09.165
- Again? - Yes.

804
00:53:09.294 --> 00:53:11.895
I'll start the engine. Come down.

805
00:53:11.895 --> 00:53:12.935
Okay.

806
00:53:15.734 --> 00:53:17.504
- Ms. Wang. - Mr. Hwangbo.

807
00:53:21.305 --> 00:53:22.745
- Let's go! - Okay.

808
00:53:26.875 --> 00:53:29.115
Sorry, Ms. Wang,

809
00:53:29.145 --> 00:53:31.314
for making you suffer like this!

810
00:53:31.814 --> 00:53:35.154
It's okay! We're doing what we want!

811
00:53:35.154 --> 00:53:36.984
I'm having fun!

812
00:53:39.395 --> 00:53:40.495
Interns,

813
00:53:40.495 --> 00:53:43.095
this is YB's core department.

814
00:53:43.424 --> 00:53:45.424
YB's flagship department.

815
00:53:45.464 --> 00:53:47.294
The source of innovation!

816
00:53:47.694 --> 00:53:50.165
The advertising video department. Where?

817
00:53:50.365 --> 00:53:52.165
Advertising video department.

818
00:53:52.535 --> 00:53:54.035
Louder. Louder.

819
00:53:54.234 --> 00:53:56.075
Advertising video department!

820
00:53:56.145 --> 00:53:59.444
You should be honored you were assigned here.

821
00:54:01.915 --> 00:54:03.245
Let's eat. Let's go.

822
00:54:03.584 --> 00:54:05.714
No, no. I said, "No."

823
00:54:05.714 --> 00:54:07.714
I'm hanging up now, okay? Bye!

824
00:54:08.754 --> 00:54:10.524
I'm going to lose my mind.

825
00:54:10.524 --> 00:54:11.555
What is it?

826
00:54:11.555 --> 00:54:14.095
- It's Mr. Hwangbo. - Yes?

827
00:54:14.095 --> 00:54:15.524
He wants us to film PR videos...

828
00:54:15.524 --> 00:54:17.495
for free for old times' sake.

829
00:54:17.495 --> 00:54:19.595
- That's absurd. - He's like a child.

830
00:54:19.595 --> 00:54:21.064
I should give him a noogie.

831
00:54:21.234 --> 00:54:23.435
That rich boy is still so clueless.

832
00:54:23.435 --> 00:54:26.504
Exactly. My stomach suddenly hurts.

833
00:54:27.375 --> 00:54:28.535
Chang Soo.

834
00:54:29.444 --> 00:54:30.845
Take a break.

835
00:54:30.875 --> 00:54:33.115
You must do all the work in our department.

836
00:54:39.254 --> 00:54:41.854
Here, Yoon Yi. This is my 101st heart.

837
00:54:43.285 --> 00:54:46.154
You pigheaded fool. Don't you get tired?

838
00:54:46.395 --> 00:54:48.395
No. You can come back whenever you want.

839
00:55:08.645 --> 00:55:11.515
Let me go over your schedule for today.

840
00:55:12.384 --> 00:55:14.185
At 1pm, you have a meeting...

841
00:55:14.185 --> 00:55:15.785
regarding YB Electronics' new product.

842
00:55:15.955 --> 00:55:18.685
At 2pm, you have a meeting regarding the whistle...

843
00:55:18.685 --> 00:55:19.924
Just a minute.

844
00:55:21.725 --> 00:55:24.564
The department is stable and we have interns now.

845
00:55:24.924 --> 00:55:26.964
There are some rules I'd like you to keep.

846
00:55:28.234 --> 00:55:29.935
Yes, sir. Go ahead.

847
00:55:32.035 --> 00:55:34.604
Smiling for no reason and looking pretty.

848
00:55:35.334 --> 00:55:38.544
Be careful. The person may get the wrong idea.

849
00:55:39.774 --> 00:55:42.415
Also, you aren't a customer service rep.

850
00:55:42.415 --> 00:55:46.055
Stop asking new hires if they need anything.

851
00:55:47.314 --> 00:55:48.584
I don't like...

852
00:55:49.955 --> 00:55:51.825
seeing you be so nice unnecessarily.

853
00:55:55.325 --> 00:55:58.194
Your heels seem to have gotten higher lately.

854
00:56:00.294 --> 00:56:02.064
You're wearing more blush lately as well.

855
00:56:04.305 --> 00:56:06.174
Seriously.

856
00:56:06.935 --> 00:56:09.475
There you go, nagging again.

857
00:56:12.104 --> 00:56:14.174
I'm not nagging. I'm showing interest.

858
00:56:14.345 --> 00:56:16.615
If you're so interested in me,

859
00:56:16.645 --> 00:56:19.115
why don't you ever attend my lectures?

860
00:56:19.984 --> 00:56:21.515
It's embarrassing.

861
00:56:22.115 --> 00:56:25.285
You always talk about me in your lectures,

862
00:56:25.625 --> 00:56:27.595
so it's too embarrassing!

863
00:56:28.654 --> 00:56:29.865
Fine.

864
00:56:30.294 --> 00:56:31.464
I will...

865
00:56:32.495 --> 00:56:35.194
go to my lecture alone.

866
00:56:36.665 --> 00:56:37.805
Okay, then.

867
00:56:41.935 --> 00:56:43.904
Yoon Yi. Yoon...

868
00:56:48.645 --> 00:56:49.785
She's mad again.

869
00:56:50.415 --> 00:56:53.254
Who is always next to a leader...

870
00:56:53.484 --> 00:56:55.884
that leads a nation or society?

871
00:56:57.725 --> 00:57:00.625
It is the personal assistant.

872
00:57:01.924 --> 00:57:05.595
The assistant stimulates a successful person...

873
00:57:06.595 --> 00:57:09.165
to make that person improve even more.

874
00:57:18.544 --> 00:57:20.745
However, we are the most helpless...

875
00:57:21.145 --> 00:57:23.544
when we meet an impossible boss...

876
00:57:24.544 --> 00:57:27.015
who flat-out refuses the assistant.

877
00:57:29.484 --> 00:57:32.084
Ask to transfer departments.

878
00:57:32.084 --> 00:57:33.524
I don't take an assistant with me.

879
00:57:33.524 --> 00:57:36.825
What does it matter if I use a pen or a brush?

880
00:57:37.725 --> 00:57:38.794
Are you that bored?

881
00:57:38.794 --> 00:57:40.365
I find people's meddling...

882
00:57:43.205 --> 00:57:44.305
very uncomfortable.

883
00:57:45.634 --> 00:57:48.834
If there is a boss like that here,

884
00:57:49.205 --> 00:57:51.274
I ask you earnestly,

885
00:57:53.015 --> 00:57:55.984
don't consider your interest as meddling.

886
00:57:56.145 --> 00:57:58.584
Please communicate and work together...

887
00:57:59.084 --> 00:58:01.785
and make your assistant your best partner...

888
00:58:02.115 --> 00:58:03.484
for your success.

889
00:58:21.535 --> 00:58:23.004
I don't remember.

890
00:58:23.004 --> 00:58:24.645
That's not right.

891
00:58:24.645 --> 00:58:26.875
There had to have been a beginning.

892
00:58:28.674 --> 00:58:30.544
I don't know. It's too hard.

893
00:58:31.944 --> 00:58:34.785
Was it when we were together...

894
00:58:34.785 --> 00:58:36.584
on Christmas?

895
00:58:37.685 --> 00:58:39.254
I don't know. Was it?

896
00:58:39.725 --> 00:58:41.694
Or was it...

897
00:58:41.694 --> 00:58:44.225
when we suddenly signed up for the boss award?

898
00:58:44.595 --> 00:58:46.194
No, not then.

899
00:58:46.935 --> 00:58:48.194
Don't tell me!

900
00:58:48.834 --> 00:58:52.274
Was it the 100 Q and As? Was it that soon?

901
00:58:53.604 --> 00:58:54.975
I'm confused.

902
00:58:55.875 --> 00:58:57.404
Seriously!

903
00:58:57.404 --> 00:59:00.915
When did you first feel something for me? Tell me!

904
00:59:14.294 --> 00:59:15.825
Really? Then?

905
00:59:17.825 --> 00:59:20.995
Your heart pounded...

906
00:59:21.665 --> 00:59:22.734
right then?

907
00:59:23.104 --> 00:59:25.935
Yes. It did.

908
00:59:42.754 --> 00:59:44.584
I love you, Yoon Yi.

909
00:59:45.754 --> 00:59:48.225
Me too. I love you.

910
01:00:43.584 --> 01:00:45.115
Are you okay? Were you hurt?

911
01:00:45.115 --> 01:00:47.384
I'm fine. I'm not hurt.

912
01:00:48.984 --> 01:00:50.924
Let's go to a hospital.

913
01:00:52.625 --> 01:00:55.154
Happy? You hit me, and I kicked you.

914
01:00:55.154 --> 01:00:56.694
We're even now, okay?

915
01:00:58.794 --> 01:00:59.834
Hey!

916
01:00:59.935 --> 01:01:01.595
Let's call it even! Okay?

917
01:01:59.995 --> 01:02:01.354
Yes!

918
01:02:37.265 --> 01:02:39.564
- You really want to know? - Yes, I do.

919
01:02:39.564 --> 01:02:42.095
Why do women always want confirmation?

920
01:02:42.095 --> 01:02:44.334
Yes, I want confirmation, so think.

921
01:02:44.504 --> 01:02:46.705
- I don't remember. - You don't remember?

922
01:02:46.705 --> 01:02:47.805
Do you remember everything?

923
01:02:47.805 --> 01:02:50.075
Who am I, Bill Gates? Stephen Hawking?

924
01:02:50.075 --> 01:02:52.075
Yes. You're better.

925
01:02:52.075 --> 01:02:53.714
(Thank you for watching Jugglers.)

926
01:02:53.714 --> 01:02:54.774
Do you remember?

927
01:02:54.774 --> 01:02:58.015
I remember everything. Why can't you?

928
01:02:58.015 --> 01:02:59.415
When did it start for you?

929
01:02:59.415 --> 01:03:00.685
(Thank you for watching Jugglers.)
