1
00:00:17.436 --> 00:00:18.666
You really have...

2
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:21.206
become a monster.

3
00:00:22.172 --> 00:00:24.742
You should have left me to live as a beggar's kid.

4
00:00:28.547 --> 00:00:29.547
Fine.

5
00:00:30.346 --> 00:00:31.846
Just kill me.

6
00:00:32.147 --> 00:00:35.087
Kill me and vent your spite.

7
00:00:58.907 --> 00:01:00.147
Ms. Jang.

8
00:01:19.596 --> 00:01:21.366
I will kill you.

9
00:01:24.137 --> 00:01:25.396
Are you crazy?

10
00:02:26.096 --> 00:02:27.127
Are you okay?

11
00:02:31.096 --> 00:02:32.737
Ms. Jang is...

12
00:02:32.766 --> 00:02:33.837
Ms. Jang.

13
00:02:36.407 --> 00:02:37.407
Ms. Jang.

14
00:02:42.407 --> 00:02:44.076
Everything...

15
00:02:47.247 --> 00:02:49.286
is over.

16
00:02:55.756 --> 00:02:56.826
Soo Ho.

17
00:02:58.457 --> 00:02:59.696
Yes, Ms. Jang.

18
00:03:05.766 --> 00:03:07.136
I want...

19
00:03:10.036 --> 00:03:11.437
you two...

20
00:03:13.446 --> 00:03:16.076
to be happy forever.

21
00:03:21.516 --> 00:03:23.816
No matter what happens.

22
00:04:19.506 --> 00:04:20.807
Ms. Jang.

23
00:05:08.287 --> 00:05:10.627
(Last Episode)

24
00:05:17.167 --> 00:05:19.906
(R.I.P. Jang Baek Hee)

25
00:05:21.937 --> 00:05:23.066
I want...

26
00:05:24.377 --> 00:05:26.906
you two to be together...

27
00:05:28.276 --> 00:05:29.506
forever.

28
00:05:30.877 --> 00:05:32.377
No matter what happens.

29
00:05:34.886 --> 00:05:36.016
We will.

30
00:07:20.687 --> 00:07:22.156
Hoping that...

31
00:07:22.456 --> 00:07:25.927
Soo Ho and Hae Ra would read this.

32
00:07:33.367 --> 00:07:34.466
Soo Ho.

33
00:07:38.136 --> 00:07:39.177
Yes?

34
00:07:57.656 --> 00:07:59.057
I have a feeling...

35
00:07:59.966 --> 00:08:01.427
that I'd be leaving...

36
00:08:02.227 --> 00:08:04.466
before the winter is over.

37
00:08:07.107 --> 00:08:09.466
I don't know which winter it'll be though.

38
00:08:14.547 --> 00:08:16.677
I'm going to start writing...

39
00:08:17.347 --> 00:08:20.417
what I want to say to you in my diary.

40
00:08:23.816 --> 00:08:24.857
By the way,

41
00:08:25.316 --> 00:08:28.826
I want to give you two a small gift.

42
00:08:31.196 --> 00:08:34.026
I hope you like it.

43
00:08:50.347 --> 00:08:52.977
I'll give my house and the hanok in Bukchon...

44
00:08:53.447 --> 00:08:54.617
to Jung Hae Ra.

45
00:08:58.756 --> 00:09:01.786
The property and building in Geumseong-dong,

46
00:09:02.526 --> 00:09:04.396
and the land in Daejeon and Yeosu...

47
00:09:04.796 --> 00:09:07.367
will be given to Moon Soo Ho.

48
00:09:21.077 --> 00:09:24.477
(Jung Hae Ra)

49
00:09:25.776 --> 00:09:28.646
Hae Ra, you can take...

50
00:09:30.117 --> 00:09:31.686
all my clothes and jewelries.

51
00:09:32.587 --> 00:09:34.327
They're not your style,

52
00:09:34.827 --> 00:09:36.756
but there will be something you like.

53
00:09:46.867 --> 00:09:47.936
This place is...

54
00:09:49.136 --> 00:09:51.936
worth being conserved as a heritage building.

55
00:09:52.436 --> 00:09:55.077
Please talk to the city hall about it.

56
00:09:56.077 --> 00:09:58.146
Will you really donate it?

57
00:09:59.877 --> 00:10:00.886
Yes.

58
00:10:03.587 --> 00:10:06.487
Okay. I'll contact the city office.

59
00:10:08.727 --> 00:10:11.197
I'd like them to open a small book store.

60
00:10:35.016 --> 00:10:36.487
Who are you?

61
00:10:47.127 --> 00:10:48.467
Sharon?

62
00:10:55.367 --> 00:10:56.737
What happened?

63
00:10:57.707 --> 00:10:58.707
Seung Goo.

64
00:11:00.477 --> 00:11:01.747
Leave this place.

65
00:11:03.617 --> 00:11:04.916
What are you talking about?

66
00:11:05.916 --> 00:11:07.046
I don't want to.

67
00:11:08.087 --> 00:11:09.587
Just do as I say.

68
00:11:25.967 --> 00:11:27.666
The number you have dialed...

69
00:11:27.666 --> 00:11:29.467
is not available at this moment.

70
00:11:31.077 --> 00:11:33.036
She's not answering her phone.

71
00:11:33.447 --> 00:11:36.247
The investors haven't changed their minds.

72
00:11:37.747 --> 00:11:41.186
I guess she's sitting back and not doing anything.

73
00:11:44.186 --> 00:11:47.026
She shouldn't think of me...

74
00:11:47.026 --> 00:11:49.786
as the poor newspaper delivery boy.

75
00:11:54.827 --> 00:11:55.827
Mr. Kim.

76
00:11:56.266 --> 00:11:57.266
Yes, sir.

77
00:11:57.997 --> 00:12:00.806
Let's barge in her shop with a cameraman later.

78
00:12:00.806 --> 00:12:02.766
Let's film something to threaten her with.

79
00:12:03.207 --> 00:12:04.506
I'll get it ready.

80
00:12:04.776 --> 00:12:06.607
Who are you going to threaten today?

81
00:12:08.877 --> 00:12:12.046
Why are you so relaxed? You idiot!

82
00:12:12.247 --> 00:12:14.317
The stupidest person will be better than you.

83
00:12:14.916 --> 00:12:16.247
Go visit the investors,

84
00:12:16.247 --> 00:12:18.416
and get down on your knees naked or something.

85
00:12:18.516 --> 00:12:19.957
You timid punk.

86
00:12:20.327 --> 00:12:22.727
What's wrong with you, seriously?

87
00:12:28.666 --> 00:12:29.697
Let's go, Mr. Kim.

88
00:12:40.306 --> 00:12:41.646
I'll protect you,

89
00:12:44.747 --> 00:12:46.276
so that you won't become more evil.

90
00:13:03.597 --> 00:13:04.837
Let's stop here today.

91
00:13:07.436 --> 00:13:09.467
I'll keep it deep in my drawer.

92
00:13:11.337 --> 00:13:13.477
I hope I don't have to take it out again.

93
00:13:14.877 --> 00:13:16.477
You won't. Don't worry.

94
00:13:18.416 --> 00:13:20.046
I heard you decided to donate the house.

95
00:13:20.317 --> 00:13:21.347
Yes.

96
00:13:21.587 --> 00:13:23.857
I said I wanted to make it into a small bookstore.

97
00:13:23.987 --> 00:13:26.957
They said they'd consider it positively.

98
00:13:27.357 --> 00:13:28.426
Won't you regret it?

99
00:13:29.186 --> 00:13:30.197
No.

100
00:13:30.197 --> 00:13:32.127
- Really? - Really.

101
00:13:50.016 --> 00:13:51.717
Did you buy this shirt?

102
00:13:53.247 --> 00:13:55.386
No, I've never bought any shirt for you.

103
00:13:55.886 --> 00:13:57.656
I don't think Aunt Sook Hee bought this.

104
00:13:57.857 --> 00:13:59.617
Aunt Sook Hee doesn't know men's clothes.

105
00:13:59.926 --> 00:14:01.686
I'm going to throw away unfamiliar clothes.

106
00:14:06.766 --> 00:14:09.097
But it's made with a nice fabric.

107
00:14:12.497 --> 00:14:13.506
Wait.

108
00:14:14.237 --> 00:14:16.436
It feels like one of the clothes made by Sharon.

109
00:14:19.276 --> 00:14:21.006
Soo Ho, give them to me. I'll throw them away.

110
00:14:21.877 --> 00:14:23.447
Hae Ra, we're married,

111
00:14:23.447 --> 00:14:25.546
so can't we call each other differently now?

112
00:14:27.347 --> 00:14:28.916
Calling your husband by his name is awkward.

113
00:14:29.247 --> 00:14:31.386
What's wrong with that? That's what everyone does.

114
00:14:31.516 --> 00:14:33.587
I want you to call me by something else.

115
00:14:34.426 --> 00:14:36.156
How do you want me to call you?

116
00:14:36.487 --> 00:14:37.697
"Honey".

117
00:14:41.526 --> 00:14:43.266
Let's go sleep, honey.

118
00:14:47.436 --> 00:14:48.436
Hello?

119
00:14:52.906 --> 00:14:54.947
I'm sorry that I asked you to come out this late.

120
00:14:56.176 --> 00:14:57.247
Have a seat.

121
00:15:02.516 --> 00:15:03.717
Go on.

122
00:15:05.386 --> 00:15:06.886
Tell me...

123
00:15:07.656 --> 00:15:08.886
more about...

124
00:15:09.926 --> 00:15:11.396
what you know about my father.

125
00:15:12.457 --> 00:15:14.827
I'm sure you know better than me.

126
00:15:16.426 --> 00:15:18.636
I'm going to stop him...

127
00:15:20.136 --> 00:15:21.666
so that he won't ruin himself anymore.

128
00:15:22.936 --> 00:15:24.036
You'll stop him?

129
00:15:24.806 --> 00:15:26.906
You'll make him confess or something?

130
00:15:30.217 --> 00:15:32.117
He's not the type to confess.

131
00:15:40.686 --> 00:15:41.686
Seo Rin.

132
00:15:42.026 --> 00:15:44.656
Why don't you answer my calls?

133
00:15:44.796 --> 00:15:46.926
Where did you learn to ignore people?

134
00:15:47.367 --> 00:15:48.367
Seo Rin!

135
00:15:51.796 --> 00:15:53.367
Where are you, Seo Rin?

136
00:15:54.936 --> 00:15:55.936
Seo Rin!

137
00:15:56.436 --> 00:15:57.577
Seo Rin!

138
00:15:59.377 --> 00:16:00.977
Where are you, Seo Rin?

139
00:16:27.367 --> 00:16:28.367
Where are we...

140
00:16:28.837 --> 00:16:30.676
going right now?

141
00:16:40.817 --> 00:16:41.817
Mr. Han.

142
00:16:42.717 --> 00:16:45.256
I think Mr. Park Gon is a nice person.

143
00:16:58.436 --> 00:16:59.536
An investigator of Prosecutor Jung Jin Woo...

144
00:17:00.406 --> 00:17:02.906
will be waiting for you.

145
00:17:05.037 --> 00:17:06.646
Go tell him what you saw.

146
00:17:11.317 --> 00:17:13.416
Tell him everything...

147
00:17:16.117 --> 00:17:17.257
that my father did.

148
00:17:20.057 --> 00:17:21.327
I can't.

149
00:17:21.986 --> 00:17:23.057
Why would I?

150
00:17:26.127 --> 00:17:27.797
What will happen to you then?

151
00:17:32.837 --> 00:17:35.007
We need to stop him, Young Mi.

152
00:17:41.377 --> 00:17:42.946
Do it for my sake.

153
00:18:58.587 --> 00:18:59.686
Mr. Park Chul Min.

154
00:19:00.087 --> 00:19:01.087
We're from the West Seoul Prosecutors' Office.

155
00:19:01.087 --> 00:19:02.156
Please come with us.

156
00:19:09.226 --> 00:19:10.767
You want a traveling route...

157
00:19:10.767 --> 00:19:13.466
for 15 nights and 16 days in Europe, right?

158
00:19:13.466 --> 00:19:14.936
I think it's best...

159
00:19:14.936 --> 00:19:16.507
to start your trip in Paris and end in Milano.

160
00:19:16.706 --> 00:19:17.706
Yes.

161
00:19:17.777 --> 00:19:20.577
I'll organize the rest and e-mail you by 3pm.

162
00:19:20.577 --> 00:19:22.277
Okay, thank you.

163
00:19:24.476 --> 00:19:25.577
Gosh.

164
00:19:25.916 --> 00:19:28.287
It'd be nice to travel 16 days in Europe.

165
00:19:28.287 --> 00:19:30.486
You could've lived in Rome too.

166
00:19:30.486 --> 00:19:33.527
That's how great the power of love is.

167
00:19:33.527 --> 00:19:34.726
You made the right choice in breaking up with him.

168
00:19:34.726 --> 00:19:35.726
Focus on your work from now on.

169
00:19:35.726 --> 00:19:37.327
Goodness.

170
00:19:37.327 --> 00:19:38.827
I told you it was a secret.

171
00:19:45.396 --> 00:19:47.236
The police have seized and are searching...

172
00:19:47.236 --> 00:19:48.636
Chairman Park's house.

173
00:19:48.706 --> 00:19:50.476
They'll start the tax investigation soon.

174
00:19:51.037 --> 00:19:52.236
The town residents of Geumseong-dong...

175
00:19:52.236 --> 00:19:54.107
are positive towards our business too.

176
00:19:54.307 --> 00:19:55.877
You didn't sue him...

177
00:19:56.077 --> 00:19:57.547
even after getting attacked.

178
00:19:57.817 --> 00:20:00.246
The residents found out about it recently.

179
00:20:01.847 --> 00:20:04.257
And that moved their hearts.

180
00:20:04.317 --> 00:20:07.057
Everything goes in your favor.

181
00:20:07.886 --> 00:20:09.426
What's the secret behind your luck?

182
00:20:23.236 --> 00:20:25.676
(Real Estate Property Gift Contract)

183
00:20:27.146 --> 00:20:28.906
You wanted to live in a hanok.

184
00:20:30.716 --> 00:20:32.646
But how can I accept this?

185
00:20:33.216 --> 00:20:35.246
I can't take this.

186
00:20:35.946 --> 00:20:38.257
This is listed under my name. Don't worry.

187
00:20:38.257 --> 00:20:39.456
I'm not giving it to you for free.

188
00:20:41.287 --> 00:20:42.357
Hae Ra.

189
00:20:43.327 --> 00:20:45.426
I have something to confess to you.

190
00:20:46.456 --> 00:20:49.567
To be honest, I'm not your real aunt.

191
00:20:49.867 --> 00:20:52.367
I know. You're my mom's half-sister.

192
00:20:53.367 --> 00:20:56.436
To be honest, that's not true either.

193
00:21:02.307 --> 00:21:05.017
She saved me when I jumped into Han River,

194
00:21:05.377 --> 00:21:06.847
took me to a hospital,

195
00:21:06.847 --> 00:21:08.746
and paid off my debt.

196
00:21:09.547 --> 00:21:12.386
Then she asked me to take care of a child.

197
00:21:12.456 --> 00:21:13.956
Ms. Jang, I mean.

198
00:21:14.587 --> 00:21:17.196
She told me to not tell until you get married.

199
00:21:21.027 --> 00:21:22.496
Why did she do that?

200
00:21:23.636 --> 00:21:25.337
Why did she...

201
00:21:26.767 --> 00:21:28.136
give us a connection?

202
00:21:28.607 --> 00:21:31.007
In our previous life, she said...

203
00:21:31.007 --> 00:21:33.646
she took my child and switched them...

204
00:21:33.646 --> 00:21:35.277
with another child.

205
00:21:35.706 --> 00:21:36.716
What?

206
00:21:36.916 --> 00:21:40.547
So she said something odd about how we should...

207
00:21:40.587 --> 00:21:42.617
each take a child and take care of them.

208
00:21:44.317 --> 00:21:46.186
Then who is the child...

209
00:21:47.186 --> 00:21:49.057
she took care of?

210
00:22:02.236 --> 00:22:03.377
I'll just...

211
00:22:04.007 --> 00:22:07.107
think of this as a long vacation.

212
00:22:10.817 --> 00:22:12.547
Sharon Tailor is...

213
00:22:12.547 --> 00:22:14.787
somewhere I worked for my entire life.

214
00:22:16.047 --> 00:22:19.186
And Sharon, you might have temper issues,

215
00:22:20.127 --> 00:22:22.627
but I love your designs.

216
00:22:30.136 --> 00:22:34.136
And I went to give Baek Hee some flowers.

217
00:22:35.537 --> 00:22:36.976
The two of them...

218
00:22:37.636 --> 00:22:40.206
buried her in a nice place with lots of sun.

219
00:22:45.746 --> 00:22:48.486
Then I'll go on my vacation.

220
00:22:53.257 --> 00:22:54.557
I have a favor to ask.

221
00:23:10.037 --> 00:23:12.936
Sharon said this is her last present.

222
00:23:18.877 --> 00:23:20.547
She wanted me to give it to you.

223
00:23:23.416 --> 00:23:25.186
It's Hae Ra's outfit.

224
00:27:25.327 --> 00:27:27.767
That did not happen.

225
00:27:28.297 --> 00:27:32.297
They are probably mistaken about something.

226
00:27:38.507 --> 00:27:39.636
This is...

227
00:27:40.146 --> 00:27:42.176
a picture you took in your old office, right?

228
00:27:45.146 --> 00:27:47.517
My employee in purchasing always took a picture.

229
00:27:47.517 --> 00:27:49.587
It's just one of...

230
00:27:50.656 --> 00:27:52.087
those pictures.

(Do Eun Pharmaceutics)

232
00:27:54.527 --> 00:27:56.386
This navy jacket in the corner.

233
00:27:57.327 --> 00:27:58.726
That's a school uniform, isn't it?

234
00:28:00.067 --> 00:28:01.966
Why was this in your office?

235
00:28:02.966 --> 00:28:05.136
We already checked that...

236
00:28:05.136 --> 00:28:08.107
Mr. Park Gon's uniform was not this color.

237
00:28:15.446 --> 00:28:16.847
We checked, and there is...

238
00:28:16.946 --> 00:28:20.117
a high chance that these are the same jacket.

239
00:28:20.117 --> 00:28:23.087
You took off Mr. Moon's name tag from the jacket,

240
00:28:23.087 --> 00:28:24.986
and you threw it away...

241
00:28:25.287 --> 00:28:26.986
near where you buried Mr. Jung.

242
00:28:27.087 --> 00:28:29.156
That did not happen.

243
00:28:35.496 --> 00:28:36.767
Mr. Park.

244
00:28:50.877 --> 00:28:53.517
He came over and helped us move.

245
00:28:54.287 --> 00:28:55.646
I didn't notice because we were busy,

246
00:28:55.646 --> 00:28:57.017
but later, I realized...

247
00:28:57.186 --> 00:28:59.557
Soo Ho's uniform and backpack were missing.

248
00:29:03.327 --> 00:29:04.327
Yes.

249
00:29:05.097 --> 00:29:07.797
What I have testified last time...

250
00:29:07.797 --> 00:29:09.396
is still true.

251
00:29:10.037 --> 00:29:13.267
We just figured we lost it on the move.

252
00:29:13.607 --> 00:29:17.607
Gon went down that road for the sake of his dad.

253
00:29:19.077 --> 00:29:22.176
And I'm telling the truth for Gon's sake.

254
00:29:23.716 --> 00:29:26.216
Chairman Park Chul Min, the genius of...

255
00:29:26.216 --> 00:29:28.986

256

tax evasion, embezzlement, and many others.

258
00:29:34.926 --> 00:29:37.097
An arrest warrant was issued...

live happily together, just the two of us?

We're already living happily together.

A lot of couples live without having babies.

276

Whatever you're worrying about won't happen.

277
00:30:38.916 --> 00:30:40.057
I have a feeling.

278
00:30:44.396 --> 00:30:45.396
Then...

279
00:30:45.797 --> 00:30:47.666
should we live without any worries...

280
00:30:48.827 --> 00:30:50.537
and plans?

281
00:30:51.966 --> 00:30:54.067
Okay. Let's not do those things.

282
00:30:56.067 --> 00:30:57.577
Just promise me one thing.

283
00:30:59.307 --> 00:31:01.077
No matter what happens,

284
00:31:02.307 --> 00:31:03.676
stay with me.

285

No matter what happens, I'll be with you.

00:31:17.327 --> 00:31:18.797
Should we visit the old castle...

287

in Slovenia on our 10th anniversary?

288

No.

Yes. Our castle will still be there after 50 years.

Do you even have 10 million dollars?

They'll keep it if it goes well.

00:33:30.396 --> 00:33:32.257
You are not hired.

342
00:33:32.696 --> 00:33:33.896
Sit wherever you want.

343
00:33:33.896 --> 00:33:34.896
- Here? - No, sit here.

344
00:33:34.896 --> 00:33:36.797
- Sit here. - There?

345
00:33:36.797 --> 00:33:38.496
(Opening event)

346
00:33:38.496 --> 00:33:39.496
Eat up.

347
00:33:41.267 --> 00:33:43.837
Gosh, Hae Ra. You got promoted...

348
00:33:43.837 --> 00:33:45.176
to manager already.

349
00:33:45.906 --> 00:33:47.077
Already?

350
00:33:47.176 --> 00:33:49.777
Honestly, all the best travel packages...

351
00:33:49.777 --> 00:33:53.517
were Manager Jung's idea.

352
00:33:53.746 --> 00:33:55.587
That's because...

353
00:33:55.587 --> 00:33:57.186
I taught her well when I was a chief director.

354
00:33:57.287 --> 00:33:59.886
- You're right. - Sure.

355
00:34:00.726 --> 00:34:02.557
- Manager Jung. - Yes?

356
00:34:02.886 --> 00:34:04.956
- What do you feed him? - Pardon?

357
00:34:04.956 --> 00:34:07.627
Mr. Moon ordered delivery yesterday.

358
00:34:07.726 --> 00:34:09.027
He ordered 30 chickens.

359
00:34:09.826 --> 00:34:12.766
Goodness. Mr. Moon is so nice.

360
00:34:12.766 --> 00:34:15.306
He even cares about the sales here.

361
00:34:15.306 --> 00:34:16.536
By the way,

362
00:34:16.536 --> 00:34:19.377
Mr. Moon hasn't aged at all.

363
00:34:19.476 --> 00:34:21.346
Actually, he's gotten even younger.

364
00:34:21.346 --> 00:34:22.846
So you should...

365
00:34:22.846 --> 00:34:24.646
look after yourself too.

366
00:34:24.646 --> 00:34:26.277
I'm not kidding.

367
00:34:26.317 --> 00:34:28.587
He doesn't look like he ages.

368
00:34:28.717 --> 00:34:30.516
It's because I feed him too well.

369
00:34:30.516 --> 00:34:31.916
I'll make him starve.

370
00:34:31.916 --> 00:34:33.627
No. Feed him chicken only.

371
00:34:33.627 --> 00:34:37.056
Gosh. He'll ask you to feed him chicken only.

372
00:34:37.056 --> 00:34:38.556
- Eat up. - It's really good.

373
00:34:38.556 --> 00:34:40.197
It's on the house, right?

374
00:34:40.197 --> 00:34:41.266
- Yes. - It's free?

375
00:34:41.697 --> 00:34:43.766
Hae Ra. Let's eat fruit.

376
00:34:44.596 --> 00:34:45.666
Okay.

377
00:34:51.377 --> 00:34:52.677
You don't need to do that. You're still pretty.

378
00:34:53.107 --> 00:34:54.447
No.

379
00:34:54.507 --> 00:34:56.206
My face is so dry these days.

380
00:34:56.206 --> 00:34:57.947
I think I'm getting wrinkles.

381
00:35:01.286 --> 00:35:03.047
I've been like that for a long while.

382
00:35:03.556 --> 00:35:04.916
Put some on me too.

383
00:35:07.556 --> 00:35:08.556
Do you want me to?

384
00:35:19.907 --> 00:35:21.737
I'll take the medical licensing exam.

385
00:35:24.107 --> 00:35:25.337
I need to take the exam again...

386
00:35:25.337 --> 00:35:26.947
if I want to...

387
00:35:26.947 --> 00:35:27.976
practice medicine in Korea.

388
00:35:29.706 --> 00:35:31.076
Will you work in a hospital?

389
00:35:32.717 --> 00:35:35.047
In a small hospital in the countryside.

390
00:35:36.657 --> 00:35:38.456
What about the Blacksmith's?

391
00:35:46.257 --> 00:35:47.326
You're here.

392
00:35:47.467 --> 00:35:49.496
I sold a lot today.

393
00:35:49.866 --> 00:35:52.266
I don't have to worry about rent this month.

394
00:35:52.936 --> 00:35:54.436
All the shipments are ready.

395
00:35:55.766 --> 00:35:56.777
There's...

396
00:35:57.137 --> 00:35:58.706
somewhere I want you to come with.

397
00:35:59.837 --> 00:36:00.907
Where?

398
00:36:03.976 --> 00:36:05.576
How is your father?

399
00:36:07.087 --> 00:36:08.317
He's in the hospital.

400
00:36:09.146 --> 00:36:10.416
He can't...

401
00:36:11.056 --> 00:36:12.056
have a normal life.

402
00:36:14.456 --> 00:36:17.257
I want Mr. Han and you...

403
00:36:18.157 --> 00:36:20.366
to take over this company.

404
00:36:24.896 --> 00:36:26.637
Please help him.

405
00:36:27.306 --> 00:36:29.407
Of course. Don't worry.

406
00:36:30.206 --> 00:36:32.076
I used to be...

407
00:36:32.476 --> 00:36:34.846
on the side that wanted to...

408
00:36:35.047 --> 00:36:36.616
redevelop this area.

409
00:36:36.616 --> 00:36:38.576
That was your father, not you.

410
00:36:39.677 --> 00:36:42.087
You know how this neighborhood...

411
00:36:42.087 --> 00:36:44.087
came to be very well.

412
00:36:44.616 --> 00:36:47.726
He's been thinking about this for a long time.

413
00:36:58.266 --> 00:36:59.697
I'll think about it.

414
00:37:05.237 --> 00:37:06.306
By the way,

415
00:37:06.777 --> 00:37:08.846
you look the same.

416
00:37:09.746 --> 00:37:11.646
You haven't changed at all.

417
00:37:20.826 --> 00:37:22.357
This is the second round.

418
00:37:22.887 --> 00:37:24.226
We'll do a toast.

419
00:37:24.226 --> 00:37:25.527
I'll shout, "Jung Hae Ra".

420
00:37:25.527 --> 00:37:28.127
And you'll say, "Goodbye!"

421
00:37:28.127 --> 00:37:30.137
- All right. - Jung Hae Ra!

422
00:37:30.137 --> 00:37:32.297
- Goodbye! - Goodbye!

423
00:37:32.297 --> 00:37:35.067
Hae Ra. Goodbye.

424
00:37:35.067 --> 00:37:36.976
Hae Ra. Bottoms up!

425
00:37:36.976 --> 00:37:38.436
- Bottoms up! - Bottoms up!

426
00:37:38.436 --> 00:37:40.607
- Bottoms up! - Chug! Chug!

427
00:37:40.607 --> 00:37:42.407
- Come on. - Chug it.

428
00:37:42.407 --> 00:37:43.547
If you don't,

429
00:37:43.547 --> 00:37:44.976
you'll have to see me dance.

430
00:37:45.677 --> 00:37:46.887
By the way, Hae Ra.

431
00:37:47.116 --> 00:37:49.047
this is so out of the blue.

432
00:37:49.047 --> 00:37:51.587
I thought you'd keep working here.

433
00:37:51.587 --> 00:37:53.286
Why are you quitting so suddenly?

434
00:37:54.027 --> 00:37:55.786
I might open up my own travel agency.

435
00:37:55.786 --> 00:37:56.927
You better watch out.

436
00:37:57.556 --> 00:38:00.326
I guess we should have our guard up.

437
00:38:00.496 --> 00:38:03.067
Take me to your company, Ms. Jung.

438
00:38:03.197 --> 00:38:04.237
I'll think about it.

439
00:38:04.297 --> 00:38:06.567
Gosh, the things you say, you betrayers.

440
00:38:06.567 --> 00:38:08.907
Please hire me first. Thank you.

441
00:38:09.936 --> 00:38:10.936
(We love you, Manager Jung!)

442
00:38:13.206 --> 00:38:15.947
Ju Hee should stay until she becomes a manager.

443
00:38:16.146 --> 00:38:18.146
And until I become a president.

444
00:38:25.817 --> 00:38:27.726
Thank you. Have some tea.

445
00:38:27.726 --> 00:38:29.257
Thank you.

446
00:38:29.326 --> 00:38:31.556
Your house is very pretty.

447
00:38:31.657 --> 00:38:35.027
But isn't it too big for two siblings?

448
00:38:35.027 --> 00:38:38.067
Wouldn't your older sister be uncomfortable?

449
00:38:38.737 --> 00:38:39.907
She's my wife.

450
00:38:42.637 --> 00:38:43.877
Honey.

451
00:38:44.206 --> 00:38:45.277
I'll take that.

452
00:38:45.637 --> 00:38:47.076
Did you bring it down?

453
00:38:47.076 --> 00:38:48.076
Yes.

454
00:38:50.476 --> 00:38:51.677
Please wrap it up.

455
00:38:51.976 --> 00:38:53.447
Okay.

456
00:39:51.076 --> 00:39:52.237
Would she...

457
00:39:53.646 --> 00:39:55.677
know a way?

458
00:40:29.746 --> 00:40:30.916
Excuse me.

459
00:40:35.286 --> 00:40:37.087
You know a way, don't you?

460
00:40:42.387 --> 00:40:43.657
Hae Ra?

461
00:40:56.777 --> 00:40:57.936
That night,

462
00:40:59.677 --> 00:41:01.746
I came here, but she was gone.

463
00:41:03.677 --> 00:41:05.377
She disappeared.

464
00:41:12.786 --> 00:41:14.987
She hasn't appeared for 10 years.

465
00:41:16.357 --> 00:41:19.027
I guess she really left.

466
00:41:30.436 --> 00:41:32.206
Let's see.

467
00:41:34.377 --> 00:41:35.646
This goes in here.

468
00:41:38.817 --> 00:41:39.877
And this.

469
00:41:41.746 --> 00:41:43.556
I should have this cleaned.

470
00:41:49.056 --> 00:41:50.996
This one goes to the cleaner's.

471
00:42:24.996 --> 00:42:27.197
Boon Yi's prayer was engraved in the ring,

472
00:42:27.197 --> 00:42:28.527
and it became a blade.

473
00:42:29.226 --> 00:42:30.837
It saved Soo Ho.

474
00:42:31.396 --> 00:42:34.737
Perhaps, it'll let him live forever.

475
00:42:37.677 --> 00:42:40.007
He might come back to normal...

476
00:42:41.107 --> 00:42:43.107
if he parts ways with the owner of the prayer.

477
00:42:50.587 --> 00:42:51.616
Here.

478
00:42:51.987 --> 00:42:53.956
I'll give you some of these.

479
00:42:54.357 --> 00:42:56.186
Disinfect the wound with them once a day.

480
00:42:56.186 --> 00:42:57.956
Okay, thank you. Goodbye.

481
00:42:57.956 --> 00:42:59.197
Bye.

482
00:43:01.197 --> 00:43:02.896
But nobody knows how it will turn out.

483
00:43:03.666 --> 00:43:04.866
The choice is...

484
00:43:06.067 --> 00:43:07.866
up to the two.

485
00:43:10.677 --> 00:43:11.677
Hae Ra.

486
00:43:19.846 --> 00:43:21.047
What's this luggage?

487
00:43:28.087 --> 00:43:29.527
Why did you hide this from me?

488
00:43:39.837 --> 00:43:41.166
In case you'd be like this.

489
00:43:46.337 --> 00:43:49.007
I'll look like your older sister, aunt,

490
00:43:52.547 --> 00:43:54.516
and your mother later.

491
00:43:57.416 --> 00:43:58.887
Do you like living this way?

492
00:44:03.056 --> 00:44:04.956
I need to disappear from you...

493
00:44:04.956 --> 00:44:07.027
so that you can go back to normal.

494
00:44:07.567 --> 00:44:08.797
No, don't go.

495
00:44:11.697 --> 00:44:13.366
Don't go no matter what happens.

496
00:44:15.407 --> 00:44:17.177
I don't like living this way.

497
00:44:19.536 --> 00:44:21.107
It's better than living without you.

498
00:45:41.427 --> 00:45:43.087
What happened?

499
00:45:43.087 --> 00:45:47.067
She fell down on a slope.

500
00:45:47.427 --> 00:45:49.396
I treated her and brought her home.

501
00:46:24.766 --> 00:46:27.536
If things that we don't like happen...

502
00:46:28.536 --> 00:46:30.976
- Let's go. - Okay.

503
00:46:34.076 --> 00:46:37.076
Don't be friends with talkative people.

504
00:46:37.947 --> 00:46:40.447
Stay away from those...

505
00:46:41.116 --> 00:46:42.587
who're interested in others' private lives.

506
00:46:44.487 --> 00:46:46.016
It'll be better to live in a big city...

507
00:46:46.016 --> 00:46:48.657
than in a small town.

508
00:46:48.927 --> 00:46:50.056
Shall we go?

509
00:46:53.157 --> 00:46:54.797
Don't increase your belongings...

510
00:46:55.226 --> 00:46:56.637
so that it's easy for you to move.

511
00:47:06.677 --> 00:47:07.907
Don't let go of her hands...

512
00:47:08.677 --> 00:47:10.476
until the end.

513
00:47:35.166 --> 00:47:36.366
By any chance,

514
00:47:36.907 --> 00:47:38.777
if I happen to die before you,

515
00:47:39.806 --> 00:47:41.846
make sure you find yourself a nice woman.

516
00:47:42.346 --> 00:47:44.246
But don't find someone prettier,

517
00:47:44.246 --> 00:47:46.377
funnier, or smarter than me.

518
00:47:46.587 --> 00:47:48.547
Just find a nice and good woman.

519
00:47:48.547 --> 00:47:51.056
Grow old into a decent old man, okay?

520
00:47:51.987 --> 00:47:55.027
Can't I meet a prettier, funnier, or smarter woman?

521
00:47:55.757 --> 00:47:57.197
Don't you dare.

522
00:48:01.266 --> 00:48:02.496
I'll think about it.

523
00:48:05.596 --> 00:48:07.837
And if I happen to die first,

524
00:48:08.206 --> 00:48:11.206
I'll ask a favor if you can go back to normal.

525
00:48:13.476 --> 00:48:14.476
To whom?

526
00:48:15.677 --> 00:48:16.947
Whomever.

527
00:48:23.186 --> 00:48:25.087
Such a favor will have a condition.

528
00:48:25.987 --> 00:48:27.257
The condition is for you to...

529
00:48:27.726 --> 00:48:30.697
miss only me until that time.

530
00:48:31.096 --> 00:48:32.657
Then you can go back to normal.

531
00:48:46.237 --> 00:48:47.447
You two...

532
00:48:48.076 --> 00:48:50.146
will meet again.

533
00:48:55.516 --> 00:48:58.416
You'll find the answer then.

534
00:49:03.396 --> 00:49:04.427
Hae Ra.

535
00:49:05.797 --> 00:49:07.226
The weather is wonderful today.

536
00:49:08.127 --> 00:49:09.326
Shall we go for a walk?

537
00:49:15.436 --> 00:49:16.607
Hae Ra.

538
00:49:18.206 --> 00:49:19.677
I...

539
00:49:21.547 --> 00:49:25.677
dreamed about going to that castle.

540
00:49:34.556 --> 00:49:35.587
I see.

541
00:50:29.507 --> 00:50:31.246
Just as I have...

542
00:50:31.576 --> 00:50:33.616
entered into time after meeting Soo Ho,

543
00:50:34.887 --> 00:50:36.956
I pray that you will recognize...

544
00:50:37.817 --> 00:50:39.056
each other.

545
00:50:57.877 --> 00:51:00.306
Do you want to go to that old ice cream shop?

546
00:51:02.907 --> 00:51:03.916
Sounds great.

547
00:51:10.186 --> 00:51:11.387
Right around the corner,

548
00:51:11.387 --> 00:51:14.027
there's this famous ice cream stand.

549
00:51:14.027 --> 00:51:15.887
It began 300 years ago,

550
00:51:15.887 --> 00:51:17.927
when they froze up some leftover milk.

551
00:51:38.217 --> 00:51:39.377
Do you know what happens...

552
00:51:39.377 --> 00:51:40.686
if you cry while eating ice cream?

553
00:51:48.127 --> 00:51:49.686
Stop it.

554
00:52:59.427 --> 00:53:00.427
Do you...

555
00:53:01.027 --> 00:53:02.697
remember the legend of this lake?

556
00:53:23.987 --> 00:53:25.757
In Korea, people say some jobs are...

557
00:53:25.757 --> 00:53:27.427
created and hidden by deities.

558
00:53:27.427 --> 00:53:29.326
Are you aware of this expression?

559
00:53:31.056 --> 00:53:32.257
I have...

560
00:53:32.627 --> 00:53:34.596
a few friends who work those jobs.

561
00:53:34.596 --> 00:53:35.596
Why?

562
00:53:38.496 --> 00:53:41.137
That lake you see, Lake Bohinj is...

563
00:53:41.137 --> 00:53:43.166
apparently where a deity called dibs.

564
00:53:44.576 --> 00:53:46.036
That's very innocent.

565
00:53:46.036 --> 00:53:47.646
That deity didn't call dibs on Gangnam.

566
00:53:48.607 --> 00:53:50.616
After the deity created the world,

567
00:53:50.616 --> 00:53:53.547
he began giving out lands for people to settle in.

568
00:53:53.547 --> 00:53:54.547
I have a question.

569
00:53:54.916 --> 00:53:56.047
How much per m²?

570
00:54:02.127 --> 00:54:04.127
But that deity made a mistake.

571
00:54:04.127 --> 00:54:05.726
He forgot to leave some lands...

572
00:54:05.726 --> 00:54:08.527
for those who worked diligently without a word.

573
00:54:08.866 --> 00:54:10.996
So that deity gave out the land...

574
00:54:10.996 --> 00:54:12.837
that he was keeping for himself.

575
00:54:13.067 --> 00:54:14.536
Then did you get any back then?

576
00:54:15.666 --> 00:54:16.677
What?

577
00:54:19.237 --> 00:54:20.346
Are you having fun?

578
00:54:34.226 --> 00:54:35.657
I remember everything.

579
00:54:37.556 --> 00:54:39.096
Even your facial expressions.

580
00:55:44.357 --> 00:55:45.427
Hae Ra.

581
00:56:42.947 --> 00:56:43.956
Hae Ra.

582
00:56:44.757 --> 00:56:45.857
Please remember this.

583
00:56:49.857 --> 00:56:51.857
No matter when or how we meet again,

584
00:56:54.067 --> 00:56:55.766
even if we cannot see each other anymore,

585
00:56:58.936 --> 00:57:01.137
remember that there was a black knight...

586
00:57:02.967 --> 00:57:04.476
who wanted to protect you to the end.

587
00:57:14.786 --> 00:57:16.146
And that his life was possible...

588
00:57:17.786 --> 00:57:19.556
because you were there.

589
00:57:25.826 --> 00:57:26.967
I love you.

590
00:57:27.967 --> 00:57:29.266
(Thank you for watching...)

591
00:57:29.266 --> 00:57:30.567
