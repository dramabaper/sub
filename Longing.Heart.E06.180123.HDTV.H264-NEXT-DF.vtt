<i>[Episode 6]</i>
- What do we do?
- Oh my!

4
00:00:29.975 --> 00:00:31.765
No, not like this.

5
00:00:33.478 --> 00:00:35.372
I can't let this happen again.

6
00:00:35.372 --> 00:00:37.399
It's possible that you're wrong.

7
00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:40.637
It could be that Mom didn't
get on that ferry this time!

8
00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:42.887
No.

9
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.264
I know that nothing has changed.

10
00:00:48.094 --> 00:00:50.183
It's exactly the same as last time.

11
00:00:54.688 --> 00:00:56.383
What are you planning to do?

12
00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:00.989
I can't just let her
die like this again!

13
00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.957

Kang Shin Woo!
Kang Shin Woo!

18
00:01:43.736 --> 00:01:46.237
Are you awake?
Can you see me?

19
00:01:50.266 --> 00:01:51.703
Big Sis.

20
00:01:51.703 --> 00:01:53.545
Are you okay?

21
00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.727
What about Mom?

22
00:01:59.487 --> 00:02:00.937
What happened to Mom?

23
00:02:00.937 --> 00:02:02.549
Why are you suddenly looking for our mom?

24
00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.159
She passed away 10 years ago.

25
00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:05.465
What?

<i>[September 2017]</i>

2017.

28
00:02:19.486 --> 00:02:21.360
It's...

29
00:02:22.278 --> 00:02:24.278
the year 2017 right now?

30
00:02:28.224 --> 00:02:30.840
Have I... been here this whole time?

31
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.881
Didn't I disappear for
a couple of months?

32
00:02:32.881 --> 00:02:35.775
What are you talking about?
Did you have a dream, or something?

33
00:02:35.775 --> 00:02:37.175
A dream?

34
00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:40.456
It was a dream?

35
00:02:42.564 --> 00:02:44.935
H... hey. Kang Shin Woo.

36
00:02:45.944 --> 00:02:49.094
Goodness, you must have
injured your head, too.

37
00:02:49.094 --> 00:02:50.534
Stay right here.

38
00:02:54.445 --> 00:02:56.145
All of that...

39
00:02:58.423 --> 00:03:00.423
was just a dream?

40
00:03:12.021 --> 00:03:13.399
Yeah.

41
00:03:14.038 --> 00:03:15.998
It must have been a dream.
That's the only way this makes sense.

42
00:03:16.548 --> 00:03:20.646
I couldn't have possibly
traveled through time.

43
00:03:47.394 --> 00:03:49.794
I must not be fully awake
from my dream yet.

44
00:03:53.133 --> 00:03:55.537
Pull yourself together, Kang Shin Woo.

45
00:04:06.562 --> 00:04:08.565
Hey, Kang Shin Woo!

46
00:04:14.973 --> 00:04:16.783
You crazy bastard.

47
00:04:16.783 --> 00:04:20.651
I get that you were drunk and all,
but how could you fall into the water?

48
00:04:20.651 --> 00:04:23.855
We were so worried about you after
your sister told us what happened.

49
00:04:23.855 --> 00:04:25.778
So, did the doctors say that
you're okay now?

50
00:04:25.778 --> 00:04:28.670
They ran all the tests on me, and
they said that I'm completely fine.

51
00:04:29.709 --> 00:04:31.389
Oh yeah.

52
00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:33.192
I had a really weird dream, you guys.

53
00:04:33.192 --> 00:04:34.338
A dream?
What dream?

54
00:04:34.338 --> 00:04:35.918
A dream about when we were
second years in high school.

55
00:04:36.466 --> 00:04:39.146
But, it was a really weird dream.

56
00:04:39.875 --> 00:04:43.021
It was a weird dream that made
my heart skip a beat.

57
00:04:43.911 --> 00:04:46.732
And it was painful, and sad.

58
00:04:46.732 --> 00:04:48.439
Maybe you were
thinking about that time

59
00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:50.499
since your mother's death
anniversary is around this time of year.

60
00:04:51.079 --> 00:04:52.737
Maybe.

61
00:04:53.338 --> 00:04:58.206
Well, thanks to that, I got to visit
the people I wanted to see.

62
00:04:58.206 --> 00:05:00.649
If it was around the time that
we were second years, then...

63
00:05:01.115 --> 00:05:03.329
it really has been a while since
we've seen everyone from back then.

64
00:05:03.329 --> 00:05:06.923
I'm most curious about what
Ji Soo is up to nowadays.

65
00:05:06.923 --> 00:05:09.658
So Ra still hasn't
heard from her?

66
00:05:10.285 --> 00:05:11.528
Well, the thing is...

67
00:05:12.148 --> 00:05:15.487
I actually did hear about
Ji Soo today.

68
00:05:15.487 --> 00:05:16.987
Ji Soo is working at
Seoul Hospital right now.

69
00:05:16.987 --> 00:05:18.076
How did you know that?

70
00:05:18.076 --> 00:05:19.591
I met up with her, remember?

71
00:05:19.591 --> 00:05:21.627
You met with Ji Soo?
When?

72
00:05:21.627 --> 00:05:24.187
You know, on the day that you guys
told me to go to the hospital!

73
00:05:24.187 --> 00:05:27.146
Did you guys get a kick from
sending me to a psychiatrist?

74
00:05:27.146 --> 00:05:28.346
And you, Choo Geun Deok!

75
00:05:28.346 --> 00:05:30.824
What was that you said
about my sexual orientation?

76
00:05:30.824 --> 00:05:34.569
How did he know that we were going
to send him to a psychiatrist?

77
00:05:35.233 --> 00:05:37.610
What on earth are you talking about?

78
00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.452
Today was the day that you were supposed
to go to the hospital, but you're here.

79
00:05:41.452 --> 00:05:44.278
Well, this is still a hospital,
but this isn't what we had planned.

80
00:05:44.278 --> 00:05:47.232
Yeah, and that's why
I went to Seoul Hospital!

81
00:05:47.232 --> 00:05:48.767
And I ran into Ji Soo there.

82
00:05:48.767 --> 00:05:50.757
Then I went back to our hometown
and saw Na Hee, too!

83
00:05:50.757 --> 00:05:52.567
She was depressed because of
her upcoming wedding plans.

84
00:05:52.567 --> 00:05:54.567
What? Who has wedding plans, now?

85
00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:56.987
What? She's getting married
without telling me?

86
00:05:56.987 --> 00:05:59.593
What? You two got the invitation
at the same time I did!

87
00:05:59.593 --> 00:06:01.023
What's with you two?

88
00:06:01.023 --> 00:06:04.004
Is... his head really okay?

89
00:06:04.004 --> 00:06:05.786
Maybe they forgot to run
some of the test on him.

90
00:06:06.494 --> 00:06:08.182
What the...

91
00:06:08.182 --> 00:06:11.276
Which part was my dream,
and which part was reality?

92
00:06:11.916 --> 00:06:13.021
Hey.

93
00:06:13.021 --> 00:06:15.742
Did you happen to see our homeroom
teacher in your dream, by any chance?

94
00:06:15.742 --> 00:06:18.437
I'm as curious about him
as I am about Ji Soo.

95
00:06:18.437 --> 00:06:21.290
I look for him on social media
occasionally, but I can never find him.

96
00:06:22.196 --> 00:06:23.706
Maybe it's because his
name is a common one?

97
00:06:23.706 --> 00:06:24.725
"Kang Shin Woo."

98
00:06:24.725 --> 00:06:26.285
What do you mean,
my name is common?

99
00:06:26.285 --> 00:06:28.892
It's because it's common that
there were two of you!

100
00:06:28.892 --> 00:06:30.178
You and our homeroom teacher
were both "Kang Shin Woo."

101
00:06:30.178 --> 00:06:32.855
What?
Who?

102
00:06:32.855 --> 00:06:34.656
You know, our homeroom teacher from
back when we were second years!

103
00:06:34.656 --> 00:06:36.889
Kang Shin Woo!
Our teacher, Mr. Kang Shin Woo!

104
00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:40.117
Mr. Kang Shin Woo... the teacher?

105
00:06:49.103 --> 00:06:50.815
What's gotten into him?

106
00:06:50.815 --> 00:06:55.930
Hey, come to think of it, doesn't he look
the same as Mr. Kang from back then?

107
00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:57.459
Yeah, he really does.

108
00:06:58.839 --> 00:07:00.009
Big Sis!

109
00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:01.817
Big Sis!

110
00:07:01.817 --> 00:07:04.497
Where did you say they found me, again?

111
00:07:04.497 --> 00:07:06.317
On the beach, near the docks.

112
00:07:06.317 --> 00:07:07.918
And not near Firefly Bridge?

113
00:07:07.918 --> 00:07:09.586
What do you mean,
Firefly Bridge?

114
00:07:09.586 --> 00:07:10.790
I got a call that you were
passed out by the beach

115
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:12.601
when I thought you were in Seoul!

116
00:07:12.601 --> 00:07:14.850
Do you know how shocked I was, you punk?

117
00:07:16.904 --> 00:07:18.593
It wasn't a dream.

118
00:07:18.593 --> 00:07:20.076
Then, why...

119
00:07:20.076 --> 00:07:22.202
I have to go and pick up my kids.

120
00:07:22.824 --> 00:07:24.485
It's going to take me
a while to get there.

121
00:07:26.125 --> 00:07:28.995
How old is yours and So Ra's eldest kid?

122
00:07:28.995 --> 00:07:30.189
Seven years old.

123
00:07:30.189 --> 00:07:31.810
We had them when we were
juniors in college, remember?

124
00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:35.903
Wow, has it already been eight
years since you guys got married?

125
00:07:35.903 --> 00:07:38.093
Time sure does fly by.

126
00:07:38.093 --> 00:07:39.845
It's been seven years, okay?

127
00:07:39.845 --> 00:07:41.516
Are you that bad at math?

128
00:07:41.516 --> 00:07:43.117
Just how long are you going
to be this dumb, man?

129
00:07:43.117 --> 00:07:45.505
Well, Big Bro over here has somewhere
to be, so I'll be going now.

130
00:07:46.021 --> 00:07:47.425
Take care of yourself.

131
00:07:48.108 --> 00:07:49.584
You're going to meet with a
woman again, aren't you?

132
00:07:50.468 --> 00:07:51.963
I told you, no!

133
00:07:51.963 --> 00:07:53.601
Yeah, right.

134
00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.432
So then, why...

135
00:07:56.377 --> 00:07:58.701
has nothing changed?

136
00:08:04.961 --> 00:08:06.620
Are you going somewhere?

137
00:08:10.711 --> 00:08:13.201
I'm going to visit Mom for a bit.

138
00:08:13.841 --> 00:08:15.139
Right now?

139
00:08:20.951 --> 00:08:22.120
Big Sis.

140
00:08:22.819 --> 00:08:24.100
Yeah?

141
00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:26.769
I'm sorry.

142
00:08:27.292 --> 00:08:28.431
For what?

143
00:08:29.327 --> 00:08:31.427
Because I couldn't do anything.

144
00:08:40.336 --> 00:08:42.602
Ugh, what's gotten into him? Seriously!

I could have saved you this time.

150
00:09:35.393 --> 00:09:37.724
I could have.

But I couldn't do it.

Is that how it is?

I should have hugged you, just once.

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.815
<i>Not a single thing had changed.</i>

163
00:11:25.594 --> 00:11:27.504
<i>I lost my mom.</i>

164
00:11:27.504 --> 00:11:29.716
<i>And Ji Soo left.</i>

165
00:11:29.716 --> 00:11:33.748
<i>And I still don't know why she left.</i>

166
00:11:34.229 --> 00:11:35.562
<i>And I'm all alone.</i>

167
00:11:35.562 --> 00:11:37.092
If it was going to be like this...

168
00:11:37.754 --> 00:11:40.595
then why was I sent to the past?

169
00:11:42.735 --> 00:11:45.010
Nothing has changed at all.

170
00:11:51.086 --> 00:11:53.172
- We're home, Mother.
- We're home, Mother.

171
00:11:53.172 --> 00:11:54.581
Hey, Kim Min Seok.

172
00:11:54.581 --> 00:11:55.902
What is this?

173
00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:59.131
Go into your rooms for a bit, okay, kids?

174
00:11:59.131 --> 00:12:00.418
- Yes, Father.
- Yes, Father.

175
00:12:00.956 --> 00:12:03.327
I said, what is this?
I found it in your bag.

176
00:12:03.327 --> 00:12:06.716
Every salaryman keeps a letter
of resignation in their bags.

177
00:12:09.355 --> 00:12:10.706
Then, what's this?

178
00:12:13.331 --> 00:12:14.601
So Ra.

179
00:12:14.601 --> 00:12:16.462
To tell you the truth...

180
00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:19.062
I want to try drawing again.

181
00:12:19.062 --> 00:12:21.092
Nobody's stopping you.
I said you could, as a hobby!

182
00:12:21.092 --> 00:12:22.394
No, not as a hobby.

183
00:12:22.394 --> 00:12:24.244
I want to give it a proper shot,
as my full-time job.

184
00:12:24.244 --> 00:12:26.203
"Family dies of starvation."

185
00:12:26.203 --> 00:12:29.095
You want us to be featured in the
newspaper with that headline, don't you?

186
00:12:35.267 --> 00:12:36.697
What is this?

187
00:12:36.697 --> 00:12:38.135
Take a look.

188
00:12:41.067 --> 00:12:42.837
Do you remember this?

189
00:12:42.837 --> 00:12:45.537
When we were second years,
we had to do that homework assignment

190
00:12:45.537 --> 00:12:47.620
where we recorded a video for ourselves,
10 years in the future.

191
00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:50.091
This is the reply that Mr. Kang
sent to me back then.

192
00:12:50.091 --> 00:12:51.312
<i>Kim Min Seok.</i>

193
00:12:51.312 --> 00:12:53.024
<i>Did you know that you
never once smiled</i>

194
00:12:53.024 --> 00:12:56.832
<i>while saying that you wanted
to become a civil servant?</i>

195
00:12:56.832 --> 00:13:01.561
<i>I really want you to be doing a job that
will make you smile, 10 years from now.</i>

196
00:13:01.561 --> 00:13:04.447
<i>You say you'll lose even the shoes on
your feet while chasing your dreams, eh?</i>

197
00:13:04.447 --> 00:13:06.504
<i>Well, who cares if you
lose a pair of shoes?</i>

198
00:13:06.504 --> 00:13:08.605
<i>You can just walk slowly</i>

199
00:13:08.605 --> 00:13:11.283
<i>taking turns with the person who will
lift you up at a time like that.</i>

200
00:13:11.283 --> 00:13:14.745
<i>I hope you make a choice that you don't
end up regretting, Kim Min Seok.</i>

201
00:13:14.745 --> 00:13:17.344
I read that again
a couple of days ago

202
00:13:17.344 --> 00:13:19.438
and looked at myself
in the mirror at work.

203
00:13:19.438 --> 00:13:21.494
And I realized that I really
hadn't smiled, even once.

204
00:13:24.683 --> 00:13:26.144
Min Seok.

205
00:13:26.802 --> 00:13:28.705
Everyone else lives
their lives like that, too.

206
00:13:28.705 --> 00:13:30.278
If you really wanted to chase
your dreams that badly

207
00:13:30.278 --> 00:13:31.876
then you shouldn't have
gotten married.

208
00:13:31.876 --> 00:13:33.330
If you were going to
do this, then why...

209
00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:35.765
Why were you so insistent that
we get married, back in college?

210
00:13:35.765 --> 00:13:36.946
Because...

211
00:13:37.807 --> 00:13:39.437
you were my dream
back then.

212
00:13:39.437 --> 00:13:40.677
What about now, then?

213
00:13:40.677 --> 00:13:41.916
Am I not your dream anymore?

214
00:13:41.916 --> 00:13:44.767
Is your dream more important
to you right now than...

215
00:13:45.403 --> 00:13:46.567
than me and the kids?

216
00:13:46.567 --> 00:13:47.860
Right now, my dream is...

217
00:13:48.306 --> 00:13:50.408
is for you and our kids to be happy.

218
00:13:50.408 --> 00:13:52.436
Smiling happily,
with the money that I made.

219
00:13:53.355 --> 00:13:55.850
I got a call from that portal site
where I posted my comics

220
00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:58.731
asking me to publish them at a
consistent weekly schedule.

221
00:13:59.356 --> 00:14:00.885
For once in my life...

222
00:14:01.428 --> 00:14:04.738
I don't want to pick the
stable and safe option...

223
00:14:04.738 --> 00:14:06.416
and do what I really want to do.

224
00:14:06.966 --> 00:14:08.352
Can't I try doing that?

225
00:14:08.352 --> 00:14:09.888
Before it's too late?

226
00:14:10.557 --> 00:14:13.847
10 years ago, there was once a time
when your dream was me.

227
00:14:14.485 --> 00:14:16.674
So, can't you put your trust in me
just one more time, So Ra?

228
00:14:16.674 --> 00:14:17.769
Please?

229
00:14:18.211 --> 00:14:19.527
Just like back then?

230
00:14:28.682 --> 00:14:31.250
Oh, it's already been printed?

231
00:14:33.836 --> 00:14:36.166
<i>[We're getting married]</i>

232
00:14:38.575 --> 00:14:40.575
<i>[The groom: Seo Beom Shik, the eldest son
of Seo Byung Cheol and Kim Young Mi]</i>

233
00:14:42.421 --> 00:14:44.485
<i>[The bride: Lee Ji Yeon,
the second eldest daughter]</i>

234
00:14:44.485 --> 00:14:45.785
<i>[of Lee Chang Geun
and Choi Young Sook]</i>

235
00:14:45.785 --> 00:14:47.850
Congratulations, Mr. Seo.

236
00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:49.840
Looks like you're getting
married before me, after all.

237
00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.826
It's all because I had
such a great disciple.

238
00:14:51.826 --> 00:14:57.004
That Choo Geun Deok kept setting me
up on blind dates, left and right!

239
00:14:57.004 --> 00:15:00.222
That damned Choo Geun Deok!
All he ever did was ruin my dates!

240
00:15:00.222 --> 00:15:01.961
So thanks to him,
I'm finally getting married.

241
00:15:01.961 --> 00:15:04.712
Anyway, Ms. Baek, you have to
come to my wedding, okay?

242
00:15:04.712 --> 00:15:06.211
All right.

243
00:15:08.572 --> 00:15:10.894
Choo Geun Deok, that bastard!

244
00:15:10.894 --> 00:15:13.157
Why is he such a generous disciple
toward Mr. Seo

245
00:15:13.157 --> 00:15:16.298
and yet, all he ever does for
me is cause me grief?

246
00:15:16.298 --> 00:15:18.092
<i>[Choo Geun Deok]</i>

247
00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:22.312
Damn it.

248
00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.120
<i>Are you getting married
without telling me, Ms. Baek?</i>

249
00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.187
Are you kidding me?

250
00:15:26.187 --> 00:15:28.048
Are you trying to make
me even angrier?

251
00:15:28.048 --> 00:15:29.246
<i>No.</i>

252
00:15:29.246 --> 00:15:30.731
It's just that Shin Woo said
something weird, is all.

253
00:15:30.731 --> 00:15:32.705
You know that I went
on a date, right?

254
00:15:32.705 --> 00:15:35.264
I'm really going to try
my best with that guy.

255
00:15:35.264 --> 00:15:37.155
So if you ruin this one for me, too

256
00:15:37.155 --> 00:15:38.687
I'll seriously kill you!

257
00:15:38.687 --> 00:15:40.376
Come on, already!
Let me date in peace!

258
00:15:40.376 --> 00:15:41.407
<i>I told you.</i>

259
00:15:41.407 --> 00:15:43.931
Date this young, successful,
and rich guy you have, right here.

260
00:15:43.931 --> 00:15:45.306
Look at you, trying it again.

261
00:15:45.306 --> 00:15:47.063
How many times do I have to tell you?

262
00:15:47.063 --> 00:15:49.990
You're not a man to me.
You're just my disciple!

263
00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:51.581
I'm hanging up, you punk!

264
00:15:51.581 --> 00:15:53.181
I have to go meet my date.

265
00:15:53.181 --> 00:15:56.129
<i>Look at you lying again, Ms. Baek.</i>

266
00:15:56.129 --> 00:15:58.330
<i>You don't have that pin
in your hair today.</i>

267
00:16:01.812 --> 00:16:02.845
Ugh!

268
00:16:02.845 --> 00:16:05.864
<i>You know, the hairpin you always wear on
the day you're going out to meet a guy.</i>

269
00:16:05.864 --> 00:16:07.673
You don't have to wear
that pin for me

270
00:16:07.673 --> 00:16:09.586
so can't you just
eat a meal with me?

271
00:16:09.586 --> 00:16:13.072
<i>There's something I want to eat, but they
make you order at least two servings.</i>

272
00:16:13.072 --> 00:16:17.240
Why don't you eat both servings by
yourself then, Mr. Rich Disciple?

273
00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.090
I'll just have to wait
until you come out, then.

274
00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:23.010
I have to go to a shoot later, but it'll
get canceled if you don't come out.

275
00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:24.159
Hey.

276
00:16:24.801 --> 00:16:26.909
Ugh, you despicable punk!

277
00:16:26.909 --> 00:16:28.429
Ugh, damn it!

278
00:16:37.448 --> 00:16:39.059
What are you doing?

279
00:16:39.684 --> 00:16:43.779
I couldn't even do the rites for mom
because of what happened to you today.

280
00:16:43.779 --> 00:16:47.509
It's soju and chicken. I want her to
have it, since she liked these things.

281
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:50.504
We already... did the
rites for Mom, though.

282
00:16:51.549 --> 00:16:53.200
What are you talking about?

283
00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:55.489
They said that you weren't
injured at all, so what's with you?

284
00:16:55.489 --> 00:16:57.184
Today's mom's death anniversary

285
00:16:57.184 --> 00:16:58.880
and we were planning
to do the rites today!

286
00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.261
Pull yourself together, already!

287
00:17:04.913 --> 00:17:06.413
Today...

288
00:17:06.932 --> 00:17:08.652
is the anniversary
of Mom's death?

289
00:17:10.144 --> 00:17:12.792
<i>The day that I went
back to the past</i>

290
00:17:12.792 --> 00:17:14.644
<i>was on the night of Mom's
death anniversary.</i>

291
00:17:15.329 --> 00:17:16.743
<i>And the day that I came back</i>

292
00:17:16.743 --> 00:17:18.359
<i>was during the day, on the
anniversary of Mom's death.</i>

293
00:17:18.359 --> 00:17:21.297
You met with Ji Soo?
When?

294
00:17:21.297 --> 00:17:24.718
<i>And so, that day disappeared...</i>

295
00:17:25.326 --> 00:17:27.438
<i>and I'm re-living this day.</i>

296
00:17:27.438 --> 00:17:29.633
One thing has changed, at least.

297
00:17:31.474 --> 00:17:33.433
There's a few hours' difference.

298
00:17:37.019 --> 00:17:39.133
<i>Ji Soo's accident.</i>

299
00:17:39.133 --> 00:17:41.502
That definitely happened tonight.

300
00:17:50.183 --> 00:17:52.163
It's the ER.

301
00:17:52.163 --> 00:17:53.903
Oh, I'll go.

302
00:17:53.903 --> 00:17:55.805
It's fine, I'll go.

303
00:17:55.805 --> 00:17:57.442
You haven't even slept
10 hours this week.

304
00:17:57.642 --> 00:17:59.179
Did you know that?

305
00:17:59.179 --> 00:18:00.791
You're always a workaholic

306
00:18:00.791 --> 00:18:02.659
but why are you even harder
on yourself every year

307
00:18:02.659 --> 00:18:04.529
when September comes around?

308
00:18:05.175 --> 00:18:07.540
At any rate, I'll go.

309
00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:09.711
So you go and get some rest.

310
00:18:09.711 --> 00:18:13.411
I'll get yelled at by Doctor Shin again,
saying I make you do all the work.

311
00:18:13.411 --> 00:18:14.871
I'll be going now.

312
00:18:22.212 --> 00:18:23.931
<i>Mom.</i>

313
00:18:23.931 --> 00:18:25.124
<i>please help me...</i>

314
00:18:25.884 --> 00:18:28.785
<i>so that I'm not helpless
to do anything again...</i>

315
00:18:28.785 --> 00:18:31.463
<i>and that I don't have to live
with the same regrets again.</i>

316
00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:34.046
<i>Please, help me!</i>

317
00:19:00.865 --> 00:19:02.263
Where are you going?

318
00:19:02.263 --> 00:19:04.847
It feels a little stuffy in here,
so I'm going to go get some fresh air.

319
00:19:04.847 --> 00:19:06.008
Sure.

320
00:19:37.575 --> 00:19:40.026
Is Han Ji Soo...
is Doctor Han Ji Soo here?

321
00:19:40.026 --> 00:19:43.145
Doctor Han Ji Soo stepped out
not too long ago.

322
00:19:43.145 --> 00:19:45.605
What about her contact information?
Can I have her phone number?

323
00:19:51.458 --> 00:19:54.816
<i>[Han Ji Soo]</i>

324
00:20:01.067 --> 00:20:05.428
The article definitely said that she got
hit by a drunk driver's car, right?

325
00:20:12.368 --> 00:20:14.291
<i>[Shin Joo Hwan]</i>

326
00:20:14.291 --> 00:20:15.829
<i>This caller has turned off their phone.
Leave a message at the tone.</i>

327
00:20:15.829 --> 00:20:17.518
Her phone is completely off now?
<i>[Ji Soo]</i>

328
00:20:24.127 --> 00:20:25.348
Here.

329
00:20:25.348 --> 00:20:27.950
Oh, how could I accept
money from you, Doctor?

330
00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:31.423
If it hadn't been for you, I would've
died of a heart attack on the street!

331
00:20:31.423 --> 00:20:32.566
This and that are separate matters.

332
00:20:32.566 --> 00:20:35.153
Oh, it's fine.
Keep your money.

333
00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:40.636
Why are you drinking so much
coffee at night, though?

334
00:20:40.636 --> 00:20:43.279
My head hurts a bit
because I didn't sleep.

335
00:20:43.279 --> 00:20:46.497
Oh, everything else is futile
if you don't have your health!

336
00:20:46.497 --> 00:20:51.391
Work and all that stuff means nothing in
the face of death, in my experience.

337
00:20:52.102 --> 00:20:54.148
Ah, here you are.

338
00:20:54.148 --> 00:20:56.151
Thank you for the coffee.

339
00:20:56.151 --> 00:20:57.728
Oh yeah, Doctor.

340
00:20:57.728 --> 00:20:59.748
Why do people see their lives
flash before their eyes?

341
00:20:59.748 --> 00:21:01.441
It was so fascinating.

342
00:21:01.441 --> 00:21:03.098
Your life... flashing
before your eyes?

343
00:21:03.098 --> 00:21:06.027
You know how they said that your life
flashes before your eyes before you die?

344
00:21:06.027 --> 00:21:07.622
Like, right before you
take in your final breath.

345
00:21:07.622 --> 00:21:12.492
All of the memories of my life that
I had in my head flashed before my eyes!

346
00:21:12.492 --> 00:21:14.769
And I saw all of the people
that I wanted to see.

347
00:21:14.769 --> 00:21:16.308
<i>Please, I'm begging you!</i>

348
00:21:17.038 --> 00:21:21.148
We can't set up a drunk driving
checkpoint because of a civilian report.

349
00:21:21.148 --> 00:21:24.509
Then, please, do whatever
it takes to make it happen!

350
00:21:24.509 --> 00:21:28.029
We don't even have enough staff
here today to do that.

351
00:21:28.029 --> 00:21:29.618
I'm telling you,
there will be an accident soon!

352
00:21:29.618 --> 00:21:32.200
Someone will get hit by a
drunk driver, and die!

353
00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:36.125
And how exactly do you know that?

354
00:21:45.104 --> 00:21:47.352
You know, sir.

355
00:21:47.352 --> 00:21:50.279
Ten years ago, I ran into
another psycho like that

356
00:21:50.279 --> 00:21:51.730
when I was stationed at Garam Island.

357
00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:54.064
He jumped into the stream
in the middle of the night

358
00:21:54.064 --> 00:21:57.211
saying he was going to the
future, or something.

359
00:21:57.211 --> 00:21:59.070
Seriously, he put up such a fuss!

360
00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:00.428
Mr. Kang?

361
00:22:04.128 --> 00:22:05.538
Thug?

362
00:22:06.108 --> 00:22:07.817
Um, no, I mean...

363
00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:09.582
Go Sung Jin.

364
00:22:12.355 --> 00:22:15.134
Hello, we've set up a
drunk driving checkpoint here.

365
00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:17.338
Excuse us.

366
00:22:17.981 --> 00:22:19.859
Long time no see, Kang Shin Woo.

367
00:22:23.336 --> 00:22:24.721
Yeah.

368
00:22:24.721 --> 00:22:27.480
Speaking of which, I really would've
thought you were Mr. Kang

369
00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:29.670
if you'd walked by without
saying anything.

370
00:22:30.667 --> 00:22:32.419
Well, it's been
ten years already

371
00:22:32.419 --> 00:22:34.969
so I'm sure that Mr. Kang doesn't look
the same as he did back then.

372
00:22:34.969 --> 00:22:36.038
Yeah, you're right.

373
00:22:36.617 --> 00:22:39.807
But, have you heard
about him at all?

374
00:22:39.807 --> 00:22:41.288
No, not at all.

375
00:22:41.288 --> 00:22:43.917
I haven't heard about him at all
since he left back then.

376
00:22:44.438 --> 00:22:45.820
Really?

377
00:22:46.705 --> 00:22:48.518
I really wanted to visit him, just once.

378
00:22:48.518 --> 00:22:49.580
Why?

379
00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:51.407
I had something I wanted to ask him.

380
00:22:51.407 --> 00:22:55.836
I wanted to ask if he thinks that I've
made good use of the chance he gave me.

381
00:22:56.618 --> 00:23:00.458
I bet he would've been really happy
if he could see you now.

382
00:23:01.327 --> 00:23:05.969
I'm sure that he would've been
quite proud of how you turned out.

383
00:23:08.498 --> 00:23:10.719
Anyway, thanks so much for today.

384
00:23:10.719 --> 00:23:13.348
And thanks for believing me,
despite how ridiculous I sounded.

385
00:23:13.348 --> 00:23:14.799
I'm indebted to you, after all.

386
00:23:14.799 --> 00:23:16.449
You got hit by the dean instead of me.

387
00:23:16.449 --> 00:23:17.928
Consider that debt repaid today.

388
00:23:18.901 --> 00:23:21.938
You've paid me back too generously,
including 10 years' worth of interest.

389
00:23:21.938 --> 00:23:24.490
I have to go, since it's time
for me to go do my rounds now.

390
00:23:30.205 --> 00:23:31.525
See you around!

391
00:23:31.525 --> 00:23:32.965
Wait.

392
00:23:34.279 --> 00:23:36.076
Did I tell you?

393
00:23:37.536 --> 00:23:41.746
That I'm really relieved to be
able to see you again?

394
00:23:45.494 --> 00:23:46.775
I'll be going now!

395
00:23:52.295 --> 00:23:55.425
Excuse us. We've set up a
drunk driving checkpoint here.

396
00:23:55.425 --> 00:23:58.923
I think the accident
happened around now.

397
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:05.118
Excuse us. We've set up a
drunk driving checkpoint here.

398
00:24:10.915 --> 00:24:12.663
Goodbye.

399
00:24:16.064 --> 00:24:18.945
Excuse us. We've set up a
drunk driving checkpoint here.

400
00:24:19.528 --> 00:24:21.375
Please roll down your window, sir.

401
00:24:21.375 --> 00:24:22.616
Sir?

402
00:24:22.616 --> 00:24:23.973
Sir! Sir!

403
00:24:23.973 --> 00:24:25.545
Hey, get him!

404
00:24:38.569 --> 00:24:43.569
<font color="E06287">[DramaFever Ver] E06 Longing Heart</font>

405
00:24:58.537 --> 00:24:59.928
I can't...

406
00:25:00.938 --> 00:25:02.763
I can't let it happen this time.

407
00:25:08.457 --> 00:25:09.936
<i>Please.</i>

408
00:25:09.936 --> 00:25:11.657
<i>Please!</i>

409
00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:37.451
Excuse me.

410
00:25:37.451 --> 00:25:39.060
Excuse me, sir!
Are you all right?

411
00:25:59.112 --> 00:26:00.392
Excuse me.

412
00:26:01.205 --> 00:26:02.829
Thanks...

413
00:26:04.536 --> 00:26:06.326
for...

414
00:26:07.527 --> 00:26:09.496
being here right now,
like this.

415
00:26:11.953 --> 00:26:14.046
Really, thanks so much.

416
00:26:17.346 --> 00:26:18.986
S... Shin Woo?

417
00:26:23.605 --> 00:26:24.986
Is that...

418
00:26:25.611 --> 00:26:27.825
really you, Shin Woo?

419
00:27:00.818 --> 00:27:03.244
Were you the one who treated
the car crash victim just now?

420
00:27:03.244 --> 00:27:04.317
Yeah.

421
00:27:04.317 --> 00:27:05.605
How is the patient's condition?

422
00:27:05.605 --> 00:27:06.898
He's only sustained
minor injuries.

423
00:27:06.898 --> 00:27:08.068
But, are you okay?

424
00:27:08.068 --> 00:27:10.978
I heard that the accident happened
right in front of you.

425
00:27:11.046 --> 00:27:12.549
Yeah.

426
00:27:17.749 --> 00:27:19.689
Who is that person?

427
00:27:19.689 --> 00:27:21.779
Is he someone you know?

428
00:27:29.788 --> 00:27:31.807
Mr. Kang?

429
00:27:32.869 --> 00:27:34.609
I'm Ji Soo's friend.

430
00:27:34.609 --> 00:27:36.788
I couldn't even introduce myself
to you properly before.

431
00:27:37.266 --> 00:27:38.417
Thank you.

432
00:27:38.417 --> 00:27:39.710
Ah, sure.

433
00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:41.698
I'll be going now, then.

434
00:27:50.596 --> 00:27:52.636
How long has it been?

435
00:27:52.636 --> 00:27:54.196
Around ten years, or so?

436
00:27:57.576 --> 00:27:59.467
Have you been doing okay?

437
00:27:59.467 --> 00:28:01.730
It's funny how people can
run into each other like this.

438
00:28:02.191 --> 00:28:05.215
It's funny how people can
run into each other like this.

439
00:28:06.247 --> 00:28:08.246
It's because I was looking for you.

440
00:28:10.965 --> 00:28:14.436
I... didn't think much about you guys.

441
00:28:14.436 --> 00:28:16.317
About you, or our other friends, I mean.

442
00:28:16.876 --> 00:28:18.934
Because I was too busy and
had too much going on.

443
00:28:19.714 --> 00:28:21.601
I can barely even remember the
stuff that happened back then.

444
00:28:21.601 --> 00:28:22.674
It's okay...

445
00:28:23.228 --> 00:28:25.355
because I remember it all.

446
00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:31.999
Sorry, I don't have much time to spare.

447
00:28:31.999 --> 00:28:34.008
I need to go.

448
00:28:34.738 --> 00:28:36.278
I liked you.

449
00:28:41.358 --> 00:28:44.970
I liked you.

450
00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:46.557
Quite a lot.

451
00:28:53.588 --> 00:28:54.954
Really?

452
00:28:54.954 --> 00:28:58.276
But that was way too
long ago in the past.

453
00:28:58.276 --> 00:29:00.704
Let's talk about the past
some other time.

454
00:29:00.704 --> 00:29:02.635
Later, when we get the chance to.

455
00:29:09.752 --> 00:29:11.752
Well, not for me.

456
00:29:13.877 --> 00:29:16.265
To me, this isn't just
something from the past.

457
00:29:16.265 --> 00:29:20.061
I remember everything from back then
so clearly, as if it were only yesterday.

458
00:29:20.861 --> 00:29:23.191
And same goes for my
feelings for you from back then.

459
00:29:23.191 --> 00:29:25.182
For me, all of that...

460
00:29:25.721 --> 00:29:27.759
is something that I want to
keep in the past.

461
00:29:28.285 --> 00:29:29.575
So...

462
00:29:30.068 --> 00:29:32.116
You want us to never
see each other again?

463
00:29:32.709 --> 00:29:33.805
Why?

464
00:29:33.805 --> 00:29:35.767
Were we in each others' lives
for a bad reason again this time?

465
00:29:35.767 --> 00:29:37.736
I don't care.

466
00:29:37.736 --> 00:29:40.076
I don't care if we were meant to be,
or if we're bad for each other.

467
00:29:40.076 --> 00:29:42.175
I don't care about any
of that stuff anymore.

468
00:29:42.836 --> 00:29:45.757
I'm not going to live with the
same regrets, Ji Soo.

469
00:29:46.906 --> 00:29:48.506
Han Ji Soo!

470
00:29:50.606 --> 00:29:52.337
Senior.

471
00:29:58.443 --> 00:29:59.916
I heard that you almost
got into an accident.

472
00:29:59.916 --> 00:30:02.375
Are you trying to make me worried sick?

473
00:30:04.586 --> 00:30:06.056
You're not hurt anywhere?

474
00:30:06.056 --> 00:30:07.836
Are you really okay?

475
00:30:08.938 --> 00:30:12.198
I didn't get hurt, but my friend did.

476
00:30:12.198 --> 00:30:14.457
You've seen him before,
right, Shin Woo?

477
00:30:14.457 --> 00:30:16.509
He was our senior,
back in high school.

478
00:30:18.698 --> 00:30:20.979
I want to make things official
between us, and go out with you.

479
00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:24.348
<i>That third year... from back then?</i>

480
00:30:24.348 --> 00:30:27.856
Oh, so this is the friend that
Doctor Kim Min Jung mentioned.

481
00:30:28.922 --> 00:30:31.730
Nice to meet you.
I'm Ji Soo's boyfriend.

482
00:30:58.519 --> 00:31:00.307
You're back, Shin Woo?

483
00:31:15.318 --> 00:31:18.198
I can't accept this handshake.

484
00:31:18.979 --> 00:31:20.888
You still don't know the rules,
just like back then, huh?

485
00:31:20.888 --> 00:31:24.866
I mean, who lies when they're
introducing themselves?

486
00:31:24.866 --> 00:31:26.598
And what kind of girlfriend looks
this uncomfortable

487
00:31:26.598 --> 00:31:29.192
when they're introducing their
boyfriend to someone?

488
00:31:29.192 --> 00:31:30.526
In my opinion...

489
00:31:31.105 --> 00:31:33.176
Ji Soo has that same expression on
her face that she had back then.

490
00:31:33.176 --> 00:31:37.346
You know, when she rejected you back then
after you confessed to her 10 years ago.

491
00:31:38.587 --> 00:31:40.882
Well, you're not completely wrong.

492
00:31:40.882 --> 00:31:42.961
So let me reintroduce myself
properly, then.

493
00:31:43.862 --> 00:31:47.563
I'm someone who will become
Ji Soo's boyfriend soon.

494
00:31:47.563 --> 00:31:48.951
Senior!

495
00:31:48.951 --> 00:31:50.202
Says who?

496
00:31:54.661 --> 00:31:57.980
Well, people should be free to entertain
whatever dreams they want to have.

497
00:31:58.443 --> 00:32:00.220
Because everyone wakes up
from their dreams eventually.

498
00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:02.903
But you know, if you're Ji Soo's
friend from back in high school

499
00:32:02.903 --> 00:32:04.292
that means that you're my junior.

500
00:32:04.292 --> 00:32:06.116
And yet, you're speaking
informally to me.

501
00:32:06.116 --> 00:32:08.460
<i>And I was your teacher too, you punk.</i>

502
00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:13.037
If you're so fond of formal speech,
feel free to keep using it.

503
00:32:18.027 --> 00:32:20.776
But, why did you call me, Senior?

504
00:32:20.776 --> 00:32:22.436
It was about the doctors' meeting.

505
00:32:22.436 --> 00:32:24.797
I was wondering why you missed it.

506
00:32:25.828 --> 00:32:27.703
Hey, you should hurry and go.

507
00:32:27.703 --> 00:32:29.578
The professor is looking for you.

508
00:32:32.011 --> 00:32:34.780
Thanks... for today.

509
00:32:36.839 --> 00:32:38.830
Ji Soo!

510
00:32:39.461 --> 00:32:40.829
It's too bad.

511
00:32:40.829 --> 00:32:42.983
But these are the rules
of the hospital.

512
00:32:49.809 --> 00:32:51.442
Wow!

513
00:32:56.250 --> 00:33:00.339
Ugh, that damned third year was by
Ji Soo's side all this time?

514
00:33:00.339 --> 00:33:02.028
Ugh!

515
00:33:04.949 --> 00:33:06.398
Yeah, Big Sis?

516
00:33:06.398 --> 00:33:08.470
<i>Where are you right now,
Kang Shin Woo?</i>

517
00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:09.583
Why?

518
00:33:09.583 --> 00:33:11.880
<i>Someone who says that he's a student
from your class is here to see you.</i>

519
00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:15.628
What are you talking about? I haven't
even started work at this school yet.

520
00:33:15.628 --> 00:33:16.749
Oh!

521
00:33:17.919 --> 00:33:19.259
What was that?

522
00:33:20.799 --> 00:33:22.097
What's going on?

523
00:33:22.097 --> 00:33:25.281
He definitely said that
he was my junior.

524
00:33:25.281 --> 00:33:27.497
So why can't I bring myself to
speak informally to him?

525
00:33:28.616 --> 00:33:30.356
It makes no sense.

526
00:33:32.859 --> 00:33:34.337
Senior!

527
00:33:38.222 --> 00:33:39.676
What is this?

528
00:33:39.676 --> 00:33:40.794
It says it, right there.

529
00:33:40.794 --> 00:33:42.576
A notice stating that you're
being sent to Garam Island.

530
00:33:42.576 --> 00:33:44.381
Why is my name here?

531
00:33:44.381 --> 00:33:45.865
Because my name
is there, too.

532
00:33:46.846 --> 00:33:48.076
Senior.

533
00:33:48.747 --> 00:33:53.664
Well, my dad is telling me to go there,
get it together, and become a new man.

534
00:33:53.664 --> 00:33:55.782
And I told him that I'd go
if he sent you, too.

535
00:33:55.782 --> 00:33:59.384
I'm going to go to the chairman and
tell him that I'm not going there.

536
00:33:59.384 --> 00:34:01.101
No, rather, that I can't go.

537
00:34:02.443 --> 00:34:06.061
I bet that he'll care a lot more his
rehabilitation project for his only son

538
00:34:06.061 --> 00:34:07.525
than some second-year intern.

539
00:34:07.525 --> 00:34:08.639
Oh!

540
00:34:08.639 --> 00:34:10.422
I'm sure he'll care more if I tell him
that you're his daughter-in-law-to-be.

541
00:34:10.422 --> 00:34:12.085
Do you seriously have
Alzheimer's or something, Senior?

542
00:34:12.085 --> 00:34:13.086
Huh?

543
00:34:13.086 --> 00:34:15.045
Doctor Yeon Mi Jung
from the Emergency Department!

544
00:34:15.045 --> 00:34:16.434
Doctor Gu Jung Hee from the
neurosurgery department!

545
00:34:16.434 --> 00:34:18.143
Doctor Oh Young Joo from
the plastic surgery department!

546
00:34:18.143 --> 00:34:19.835
And other interns and patients
besides those doctors, too!

547
00:34:19.835 --> 00:34:21.692
I know all about your ex-girlfriends

548
00:34:21.692 --> 00:34:22.914
so do you really want to
act this way toward me, Senior?

549
00:34:22.914 --> 00:34:24.264
Come on.

550
00:34:24.264 --> 00:34:27.813
Despite everything, the only one
I want to go there with is you.

551
00:34:28.425 --> 00:34:29.501
Senior!

552
00:34:29.501 --> 00:34:32.653
It'll be a serious struggle
to live on that island.

553
00:34:32.653 --> 00:34:35.693
Why do you think crazy things happen
on secluded islands, after all?

554
00:34:37.759 --> 00:34:41.338
Well, so, who knows?

555
00:34:41.338 --> 00:34:44.849
You might finally accept my feelings
if we go there together.

556
00:34:45.838 --> 00:34:47.998
Oh, whatever!
I don't want to do long-distance!

557
00:34:47.998 --> 00:34:50.157
I can't, and won't!

558
00:34:58.434 --> 00:35:00.802
<i>[Kang Shin Woo]</i>

559
00:35:11.456 --> 00:35:13.072
Big Sis!

560
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:19.427
Who did you say was here again, Big Sis?

561
00:35:25.677 --> 00:35:27.728
Who on earth could this be?

562
00:35:36.215 --> 00:35:38.655
- You...
- You're here, Mr. Kang?

563
00:35:38.655 --> 00:35:40.916
- How are you...
- Big Sis!

564
00:35:40.916 --> 00:35:42.896
Is there any more
dish soap?

565
00:35:43.746 --> 00:35:45.275
It's below the sink.

566
00:35:47.110 --> 00:35:49.235
I'll explain everything, Big Sis.

567
00:35:49.235 --> 00:35:50.409
You see, what happened is...

568
00:35:50.409 --> 00:35:52.619
I know.
I heard everything.

569
00:35:52.619 --> 00:35:55.182
He said that he was in your class
when you were teaching in Seoul.

570
00:35:55.182 --> 00:35:57.873
And you told him to hide out
at our house for a bit.

571
00:35:59.903 --> 00:36:03.324
Since his family went broke,
and is being chased by load sharks.

572
00:36:03.324 --> 00:36:04.744
What?

573
00:36:05.675 --> 00:36:08.844
Hey, stop doing the dishes and tell
your homeroom teacher to do them now.

574
00:36:08.844 --> 00:36:10.831
He's good at doing that kind of thing.

575
00:36:17.291 --> 00:36:18.885
Hey, hey, hey!

576
00:36:19.481 --> 00:36:21.222
What's going on?
Why are you here?

577
00:36:21.222 --> 00:36:22.961
How are you even here right now?

578
00:36:22.961 --> 00:36:24.447
Where else could I go, then?

579
00:36:24.447 --> 00:36:26.097
The night duty room at school?

580
00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:29.043
That's not what I mean!

581
00:36:29.043 --> 00:36:32.619
What I mean is, how are
you here, in the year 2017?

582
00:36:32.619 --> 00:36:34.431
I followed you, Mr. Kang.

583
00:36:35.170 --> 00:36:36.221
What?

584
00:36:36.221 --> 00:36:38.300
- Oh, goodness!
- Mr. Kang!

585
00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:42.831
- Oh my goodness!
- Oh no!

586
00:37:02.519 --> 00:37:04.525
T-then...

587
00:37:04.525 --> 00:37:07.659
why weren't you there
when they found me?

588
00:37:07.659 --> 00:37:09.400
I think the tides carried me off
to somewhere else.

589
00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:12.509
When I woke up, I was at Naram Island,
the island next to this one.

590
00:37:12.509 --> 00:37:15.038
And I was late getting here since
I had to wait for the ferry.

591
00:37:15.038 --> 00:37:18.043
Hey, you... wait, turn off the faucet.

592
00:37:18.043 --> 00:37:19.244
Wow.

593
00:37:19.244 --> 00:37:21.599
You came from a time
where there wasn't any LTE

594
00:37:21.599 --> 00:37:23.971
so how is it that you got adjusted to
this place faster than the speed of LTE?

595
00:37:23.971 --> 00:37:24.983
Huh?

596
00:37:24.983 --> 00:37:27.157
Hey, this is the year 2017!
Are you aware of that?

597
00:37:27.157 --> 00:37:30.170
Aren't you curious about anything?
Aren't you surprised at all?

598
00:37:31.458 --> 00:37:32.679
Well, that's why...

599
00:37:33.349 --> 00:37:35.019
I'm here right now.

600
00:37:37.898 --> 00:37:39.929
Where's our mom?

601
00:37:45.172 --> 00:37:46.958
Mr. Kang.

602
00:37:48.027 --> 00:37:50.668
Why isn't our mom here?

603
00:37:51.442 --> 00:37:52.677
Huh?

604
00:38:49.201 --> 00:38:51.389
You'll turn to stone like that woman
who waited for husband.

605
00:38:51.389 --> 00:38:53.230
How many days have you
been here, already?

606
00:38:54.461 --> 00:38:56.181
You're here early.

607
00:38:56.967 --> 00:38:59.469
I told you to get a good look
at how things have changed in 2017

608
00:38:59.469 --> 00:39:01.775
so why are you staying here, like this?

609
00:39:01.775 --> 00:39:04.405
Not much has changed, anyway.

610
00:39:05.425 --> 00:39:07.206
Still.

611
00:39:10.164 --> 00:39:13.541
You have to go back to '07 soon.

612
00:39:13.541 --> 00:39:15.496
But it'd be a shame to
have you just leave like this.

613
00:39:15.496 --> 00:39:20.485
Is there any way for me to go back
if I wanted to, though?

614
00:39:20.485 --> 00:39:22.199
You want to go back?

615
00:39:24.387 --> 00:39:26.643
What would I even do if
I stayed here any longer?

616
00:39:27.422 --> 00:39:30.512
It doesn't matter if I'm here, or there.

617
00:39:31.251 --> 00:39:33.443
Either way, Mom is no longer
neither here nor there.

618
00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:38.851
Mr. Kang.

619
00:39:39.751 --> 00:39:41.902
Will I ever...

620
00:39:42.771 --> 00:39:44.784
feel okay, eventually?

621
00:39:49.731 --> 00:39:53.481
I feel like there's too big of a hole
that's formed, right here.

622
00:39:55.811 --> 00:39:57.855
And every time I breathe...

623
00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:01.742
it hurts so much that
I feel like I'll die.

624
00:40:04.929 --> 00:40:06.900
So, will there ever come a day...

625
00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:11.541
when this hole will be mended?

626
00:40:15.329 --> 00:40:17.889
I'm sure you must know, Mr. Kang.

627
00:40:18.971 --> 00:40:21.179
Because you're me.

628
00:40:22.891 --> 00:40:24.510
No.

629
00:40:28.681 --> 00:40:31.103
There's still a hole
inside of my heart, too.

630
00:40:31.103 --> 00:40:32.853
Right here.

631
00:40:33.728 --> 00:40:35.438
But...

632
00:40:36.318 --> 00:40:39.940
you'll learn how to live
with a hole in your heart.

633
00:40:41.018 --> 00:40:44.106
The hole won't ever disappear.

634
00:40:44.106 --> 00:40:48.286
But on some days, flowers will
blossom around this hole.

635
00:40:48.286 --> 00:40:50.239
And on some days, it will rain.

636
00:40:50.708 --> 00:40:52.695
And on some days,
there's a rainbow.

637
00:40:53.335 --> 00:40:58.784
And on some days, you forget the
fact that there's a hole here at all.

638
00:40:59.945 --> 00:41:02.365
And so, there will come a day
when you'll be able to smile again.

639
00:41:03.108 --> 00:41:05.884
Right now, I find that hard to believe.

640
00:41:14.086 --> 00:41:16.065
But the very thing
proving that it's true

641
00:41:16.065 --> 00:41:17.440
is by your side, right now.

642
00:41:19.972 --> 00:41:21.972
Because you're alive...

643
00:41:22.583 --> 00:41:24.675
you'll learn how to live on.

644
00:41:24.675 --> 00:41:26.853
Just as I did.

645
00:41:29.003 --> 00:41:32.182
So let's find a way to
get you back, no matter what.

646
00:41:32.182 --> 00:41:34.463
You're still so young...

647
00:41:35.193 --> 00:41:38.961
and knowing what'll happen in the future
is too heavy of a burden for you to bear.

648
00:41:41.585 --> 00:41:43.351
All right.

649
00:41:46.101 --> 00:41:48.257
You head home first, Mr. Kang.

650
00:41:48.257 --> 00:41:50.081
I'll stay here a bit longer before I go.

651
00:41:51.322 --> 00:41:53.003
All right.

652
00:41:57.164 --> 00:41:58.833
Mr. Kang.

653
00:42:02.309 --> 00:42:04.090
What about Ji Soo?

654
00:42:04.090 --> 00:42:06.291
Ji Soo... is doing well, right?

655
00:42:06.291 --> 00:42:07.485
Yeah!

656
00:42:07.485 --> 00:42:09.541
Of course!
Ji Soo is doing fine.

657
00:42:09.541 --> 00:42:11.300
Ji Soo is in Seoul right now.

658
00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:16.445
So, how did it go between me and her...
no, I mean, between you and her?

659
00:42:16.445 --> 00:42:20.275
Didn't you say before that you couldn't
confess your feelings to your first love

660
00:42:20.275 --> 00:42:22.273
and that you regretted it?

661
00:42:22.273 --> 00:42:25.226
Oh, no!
I did confess to her!

662
00:42:25.226 --> 00:42:27.713
Things between me and Ji Soo
are going great right now!

663
00:42:27.713 --> 00:42:32.804
So, don't worry about a thing
and just go back.

664
00:42:32.804 --> 00:42:34.112
All right.

665
00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:36.548
I'll be going now.

666
00:42:42.878 --> 00:42:44.748
See?
I'm telling you.

667
00:42:44.748 --> 00:42:47.579
Knowing the future
is like a curse.

668
00:42:51.623 --> 00:42:54.036
If he knows that we didn't
see each other for ten years...

669
00:42:54.588 --> 00:42:57.072
and that our relationship is in
this state after 10 years...

670
00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:16.911
Drink this.

671
00:43:17.909 --> 00:43:20.257
I know you always get like this
whenever you get on a boat.

672
00:43:20.257 --> 00:43:22.592
I don't understand how anyone
could get this seasick.

673
00:43:24.583 --> 00:43:26.753
Thank you, Senior.

674
00:43:27.346 --> 00:43:28.842
You're even having cold sweats.

675
00:43:28.842 --> 00:43:30.373
Are you sure you're not sick?

676
00:43:30.373 --> 00:43:31.572
Senior.

677
00:43:31.572 --> 00:43:33.663
Have you ever seen your life
flash before your eyes?

678
00:43:33.663 --> 00:43:35.021
My life flash before my eyes?

679
00:43:35.021 --> 00:43:37.882
I saw it, a couple of days ago.

680
00:43:38.536 --> 00:43:40.534
They say that people see their
lives flash before their eyes

681
00:43:40.534 --> 00:43:42.724
when they have a
near-death experience.

682
00:43:43.612 --> 00:43:45.574
And it turns out that was true.

683
00:43:46.393 --> 00:43:49.963
The happiest memories
that I had while I was alive...

684
00:43:49.963 --> 00:43:51.793
my most painful moments...

685
00:43:52.496 --> 00:43:54.181
and the people I wanted to see.

686
00:43:55.782 --> 00:43:59.653
I saw all of those things
flash before my eyes.

687
00:43:59.653 --> 00:44:01.293
So...

688
00:44:02.163 --> 00:44:04.077
what did you see?

689
00:44:07.981 --> 00:44:09.635
This place.

690
00:44:10.425 --> 00:44:14.166
This is what I saw.
This place.

691
00:44:27.818 --> 00:44:30.346
You go ahead to the hospital, Senior.

692
00:44:30.346 --> 00:44:32.251
I have to visit a certain place
before I go.

693
00:44:32.251 --> 00:44:33.581
Where?

694
00:44:35.648 --> 00:44:38.119
All right.
I'll be going, then.

695
00:45:27.668 --> 00:45:29.673
Ms. Lee.

696
00:45:31.992 --> 00:45:34.311
I don't think I was able
to forget anything, either...

697
00:45:35.130 --> 00:45:37.351
if I'm being honest with myself.

698
00:45:40.335 --> 00:45:42.106
So...

699
00:45:42.775 --> 00:45:45.905
I don't think I should hold
onto this any longer.

700
00:45:49.456 --> 00:45:51.666
I'm sorry to be returning this to you...

701
00:45:52.646 --> 00:45:54.135
so late.

702
00:46:40.994 --> 00:46:51.068

<i>Everyone will recognize you,
since you came from the past.</i>

716
00:47:24.340 --> 00:47:26.050
<i>How will you explain
yourself then? Huh?</i>

717
00:47:26.050 --> 00:47:29.362
<i>I came all this way, so it'd be a shame
if I were to just leave.</i>
