1
00:01:32.584 --> 00:01:34.485
We're at the intersection by the railroad.

2
00:01:34.554 --> 00:01:36.185
It's a huge accident.

3
00:01:36.185 --> 00:01:37.485
You have to hurry.

4
00:02:17.965 --> 00:02:18.995
What's going on?

5
00:02:27.634 --> 00:02:28.974
May I borrow your phone?

6
00:02:33.745 --> 00:02:35.444
(Episode 19)

7
00:02:41.685 --> 00:02:42.685
Hello?

8
00:02:43.215 --> 00:02:45.254
It's me. I got into a small accident.

9
00:02:45.254 --> 00:02:46.824
I'll take care of this and go home.

10
00:02:46.824 --> 00:02:48.025
An accident?

11
00:02:48.595 --> 00:02:49.595
Soo Ho.

12
00:02:50.025 --> 00:02:53.664
Hello? Soo Ho?

13
00:02:57.504 --> 00:02:58.835
He got into an accident?

14
00:02:59.264 --> 00:03:01.734
Nothing was wrong with it until I got to the hotel.

15
00:03:01.734 --> 00:03:03.704
Someone did something to my car on purpose.

16
00:03:04.444 --> 00:03:06.275
When was the last tune up?

17
00:03:07.474 --> 00:03:08.845
Please check the security cameras...

18
00:03:08.845 --> 00:03:10.615
in the hotel parking lot and the vicinity.

19
00:03:10.944 --> 00:03:12.484
Also, check if it was...

20
00:03:13.785 --> 00:03:15.085
done by Chairman Park.

21
00:03:18.224 --> 00:03:20.254
Okay. I'll look into it.

22
00:03:22.454 --> 00:03:24.525
I could've gotten hurt or killed.

23
00:03:25.125 --> 00:03:27.935
Sure. Don't worry.

24
00:03:27.935 --> 00:03:30.305
You can go home. I'll contact you.

25
00:03:31.264 --> 00:03:32.365
Excuse me.

26
00:03:32.965 --> 00:03:35.104
I almost got killed in this accident.

27
00:03:38.004 --> 00:03:39.474
Please do a thorough investigation.

28
00:03:39.645 --> 00:03:41.414
Don't answer just for the sake of it.

29
00:03:49.215 --> 00:03:50.384
What happened?

30
00:03:57.164 --> 00:03:58.264
Hae Ra.

31
00:04:00.194 --> 00:04:01.294
Soo Ho.

32
00:04:01.634 --> 00:04:03.065
What happened?

33
00:04:03.335 --> 00:04:05.604
I'm sorry. There was a problem with the car.

34
00:04:05.604 --> 00:04:07.835
I had to rent a car and then get the groceries.

35
00:04:08.405 --> 00:04:09.634
I'm sorry for making you wait.

36
00:04:10.875 --> 00:04:12.574
You said it was a small accident.

37
00:04:12.574 --> 00:04:13.574
Well...

38
00:04:14.414 --> 00:04:15.574
It was nothing.

39
00:04:16.845 --> 00:04:18.015
What about your phone?

40
00:04:18.015 --> 00:04:19.515
You called with someone else's.

41
00:04:19.744 --> 00:04:21.414
I dropped it.

42
00:04:21.414 --> 00:04:23.414
The screen got smashed, so I had to fix it.

43
00:04:23.414 --> 00:04:24.484
You must be hungry.

44
00:04:24.484 --> 00:04:26.554
I had them prepare everything.

45
00:04:26.554 --> 00:04:27.854
So you can just boil it in a pot.

46
00:04:28.395 --> 00:04:29.955
You can wash your hands and rest.

47
00:04:29.955 --> 00:04:31.265
I'll have dinner ready.

48
00:04:31.424 --> 00:04:32.424
Okay.

49
00:04:44.174 --> 00:04:45.275
It's done.

50
00:04:46.005 --> 00:04:47.715
Soo Ho, let's eat.

51
00:04:49.044 --> 00:04:50.585
You must be starving.

52
00:04:50.645 --> 00:04:52.145
Hurry up.

53
00:04:55.155 --> 00:04:56.314
Soo Ho.

54
00:05:09.135 --> 00:05:11.405
You should eat before you go to bed.

55
00:05:16.405 --> 00:05:17.945
Are you pretending to be asleep?

56
00:05:22.374 --> 00:05:23.744
Soo Ho.

57
00:05:28.684 --> 00:05:30.015
Why is he burning up?

58
00:05:33.655 --> 00:05:34.755
Is he sick?

59
00:05:56.515 --> 00:05:57.645
Seung Goo.

60
00:05:58.445 --> 00:06:00.914
Let's go to the market for some supplies.

61
00:06:01.114 --> 00:06:04.054
I want to decorate this with fancy beads.

62
00:06:04.085 --> 00:06:05.184
Unbelievable.

63
00:06:06.585 --> 00:06:07.825
Take a look at this.

64
00:06:08.095 --> 00:06:10.595
This is the top trending video right now.

65
00:06:14.994 --> 00:06:16.835
A car rolled over...

66
00:06:16.835 --> 00:06:18.734
at an intersection by the railroad.

67
00:06:18.734 --> 00:06:20.035
But he didn't get hurt at all.

68
00:06:20.575 --> 00:06:21.974
This is unbelievable.

69
00:06:26.775 --> 00:06:29.044
Was it because he was so flexible?

70
00:06:29.474 --> 00:06:31.044
It's a real mystery.

71
00:06:33.345 --> 00:06:34.554
Doesn't he...

72
00:06:35.814 --> 00:06:37.484
look like Moon Soo Ho?

73
00:06:41.054 --> 00:06:43.965
Wait. Now that you mention it...

74
00:06:46.325 --> 00:06:48.794
Do you remember him?

75
00:06:49.195 --> 00:06:51.405
If it's the intersection by the railroad,

76
00:06:52.604 --> 00:06:55.035
that's near their honeymoon place.

77
00:06:55.205 --> 00:06:57.674
How do you know that?

78
00:06:59.244 --> 00:07:01.275
How did he not get hurt at all?

79
00:07:01.275 --> 00:07:03.414
He's someone else's husband.

80
00:07:03.845 --> 00:07:05.114
Don't even think about him.

81
00:07:29.874 --> 00:07:31.575
Don't think about running away.

82
00:07:36.515 --> 00:07:38.145
He was weird too then.

83
00:07:40.684 --> 00:07:42.385
He was fine after one day...

84
00:07:51.325 --> 00:07:52.895
No way.

85
00:07:55.434 --> 00:07:57.804
Have you become immortal?

86
00:08:17.124 --> 00:08:18.325
Soo Ho.

87
00:08:20.554 --> 00:08:22.155
Don't be sick.

88
00:08:24.994 --> 00:08:27.494
We promised to live happily ever after.

89
00:08:54.324 --> 00:08:56.225
You should be enjoying your honeymoon.

90
00:08:56.225 --> 00:08:57.924
Why are you calling me?

91
00:08:58.424 --> 00:09:00.025
You two didn't fight, did you?

92
00:09:00.535 --> 00:09:01.594
No.

93
00:09:01.995 --> 00:09:03.834
A doctor came and just left.

94
00:09:03.834 --> 00:09:05.365
His vitals are normal.

95
00:09:05.365 --> 00:09:07.074
There's nothing wrong with him.

96
00:09:07.505 --> 00:09:10.275
He bragged about how fit he's gotten lately.

97
00:09:10.905 --> 00:09:13.005
But he's been sleeping all day,

98
00:09:13.005 --> 00:09:14.414
so I'm worried.

99
00:09:15.645 --> 00:09:18.015
The wedding must've made him really nervous.

100
00:09:18.944 --> 00:09:21.655
Things were fine when you were driving there, right?

101
00:09:21.755 --> 00:09:24.655
He went out alone and got into a small accident.

102
00:09:24.655 --> 00:09:26.285
But he came back fine.

103
00:09:26.285 --> 00:09:27.924
Nothing else happened other than that.

104
00:09:29.625 --> 00:09:31.964
Just let him sleep a little longer.

105
00:09:31.964 --> 00:09:33.525
Don't worry too much.

106
00:09:34.164 --> 00:09:37.334
Yes. Call me when he wakes up.

107
00:09:57.184 --> 00:09:58.355
I thought...

108
00:09:58.554 --> 00:10:00.495
we weren't going to see each other anymore.

109
00:10:01.395 --> 00:10:03.824
I came to give you interesting news.

110
00:10:04.064 --> 00:10:05.395
Whatever it is,

111
00:10:06.294 --> 00:10:07.694
I don't want to hear it.

112
00:10:08.094 --> 00:10:09.594
I think Moon Soo Ho...

113
00:10:11.035 --> 00:10:13.164
has become like us.

114
00:10:20.105 --> 00:10:22.375
I called the local police.

115
00:10:23.314 --> 00:10:25.015
The car was totaled.

116
00:10:25.015 --> 00:10:26.515
But he wasn't hurt at all.

117
00:10:28.214 --> 00:10:29.314
That's because Soo Ho...

118
00:10:30.584 --> 00:10:32.385
is lucky.

119
00:10:32.554 --> 00:10:35.194
Soo Ho will not grow old nor die.

120
00:10:36.395 --> 00:10:38.865
He probably got a special power too.

121
00:10:38.865 --> 00:10:42.194
Soo Ho has done nothing wrong to become like us.

122
00:10:43.495 --> 00:10:45.035
There must be a reason.

123
00:10:46.635 --> 00:10:49.235
Everything will be so hard and unfamiliar at first.

124
00:10:51.245 --> 00:10:53.005
You should console him.

125
00:11:24.704 --> 00:11:27.145
Why are you making clothes all of a sudden?

126
00:11:28.414 --> 00:11:30.344
Reduce the waistline a little more.

127
00:11:30.814 --> 00:11:32.914
I guess you have good news.

128
00:11:34.255 --> 00:11:35.314
Just because.

129
00:11:36.285 --> 00:11:38.454
I suddenly want to wear pretty clothes.

130
00:11:43.355 --> 00:11:44.365
Wait.

131
00:11:45.025 --> 00:11:46.824
- What? - Hold on.

132
00:11:50.505 --> 00:11:51.505
Gosh, that stings.

133
00:11:52.135 --> 00:11:53.405
I got your Grey hair.

134
00:11:54.275 --> 00:11:55.635
Grey hair?

135
00:11:57.645 --> 00:11:59.074
I have Grey hair?

136
00:11:59.505 --> 00:12:01.645
Let's see.

137
00:12:04.645 --> 00:12:06.985
You've got a lot on the inner side.

138
00:12:10.525 --> 00:12:12.454
Gosh, Sharon.

139
00:12:13.155 --> 00:12:14.625
You look young,

140
00:12:14.824 --> 00:12:16.525
but you can't avoid the passing of time.

141
00:12:18.225 --> 00:12:19.294
I just realized...

142
00:12:19.824 --> 00:12:23.094
your eyes are drooping a little.

143
00:12:24.005 --> 00:12:26.035
You should get facial massages.

144
00:12:32.245 --> 00:12:33.444
No way.

145
00:12:41.655 --> 00:12:42.655
Why are you here again?

146
00:12:42.755 --> 00:12:43.755
Baek Hee.

147
00:12:44.355 --> 00:12:46.054
I think I'm getting old now.

148
00:12:46.084 --> 00:12:48.495
I've got Grey hair and wrinkles around my eyes.

149
00:12:48.725 --> 00:12:50.365
I have so much Grey hair.

150
00:12:50.365 --> 00:12:51.464
What's happening to me?

151
00:12:52.824 --> 00:12:54.934
- That's good to hear. - Tell me what's going on.

152
00:12:54.934 --> 00:12:56.464
Myung So and Boon Yi...

153
00:12:57.834 --> 00:13:00.434
Soo Ho and Hae Ra got married.

154
00:13:01.804 --> 00:13:03.804
I guess your punishment ended too.

155
00:13:17.554 --> 00:13:19.324
Why do I feel bad?

156
00:13:19.655 --> 00:13:20.895
From now on,

157
00:13:22.094 --> 00:13:24.194
if you try to split the two,

158
00:13:25.525 --> 00:13:27.464
you'll get old quickly in a moment.

159
00:13:27.964 --> 00:13:29.464
You'll become an old woman.

160
00:13:29.995 --> 00:13:31.005
And...

161
00:13:31.605 --> 00:13:33.934
you'll end up living with that appearance.

162
00:13:33.934 --> 00:13:35.334
But he's become immortal...

163
00:13:35.334 --> 00:13:37.005
who never gets old.

164
00:13:37.944 --> 00:13:39.245
That's not possible.

165
00:13:44.444 --> 00:13:45.444
What's wrong?

166
00:13:45.814 --> 00:13:47.054
What do you mean?

167
00:13:48.615 --> 00:13:50.684
It's because I'm getting old.

168
00:13:53.155 --> 00:13:54.424
Try to...

169
00:13:55.655 --> 00:13:58.194
feel and enjoy the passing time too.

170
00:14:03.964 --> 00:14:05.035
I don't want to.

171
00:14:11.544 --> 00:14:13.645
Gather up, guys.

172
00:14:13.944 --> 00:14:15.344
- Gather up. - What's the matter?

173
00:14:15.344 --> 00:14:16.344
Gather up first.

174
00:14:19.084 --> 00:14:20.655
Did you watch the hot issue video?

175
00:14:20.655 --> 00:14:22.515
It's been the talk of the town since yesterday.

176
00:14:24.285 --> 00:14:26.084
You gathered us because of that?

177
00:14:26.084 --> 00:14:28.895
- Of course we watched it. - So you did.

178
00:14:28.895 --> 00:14:31.594
I watched the original version of it just now.

179
00:14:32.225 --> 00:14:33.564
It's Mr. Moon.

180
00:14:34.664 --> 00:14:36.664
- What? - Are you serious?

181
00:14:37.164 --> 00:14:38.535
That's Mr. Moon?

182
00:14:39.164 --> 00:14:40.434
Oh, my goodness.

183
00:14:41.975 --> 00:14:43.405
Is Ms. Jung all right?

184
00:14:43.944 --> 00:14:45.344
Why did she have to get married...

185
00:14:45.344 --> 00:14:46.775
when the company's so busy in the first place?

186
00:14:47.615 --> 00:14:48.775
Excuse me, sir.

187
00:14:49.115 --> 00:14:51.485
That's out of line.

188
00:14:51.515 --> 00:14:53.954
You should think before saying something.

189
00:14:55.015 --> 00:14:56.584
I'm just worried. That's all.

190
00:14:57.125 --> 00:14:58.454
Try calling her.

191
00:14:59.125 --> 00:15:00.125
You're dismissed.

192
00:15:00.395 --> 00:15:01.694
Gosh, it's so tiring.

193
00:15:02.824 --> 00:15:04.365
What's going on?

194
00:15:07.094 --> 00:15:09.434
I was also surprised when I watched the video...

195
00:15:09.434 --> 00:15:10.735
that Ju Hee sent me.

196
00:15:11.535 --> 00:15:12.564
I really...

197
00:15:12.635 --> 00:15:13.934
I'll call you again.

198
00:15:16.405 --> 00:15:17.574
Are you awake?

199
00:15:19.304 --> 00:15:20.475
What's this?

200
00:15:21.245 --> 00:15:22.314
Are you okay?

201
00:15:22.975 --> 00:15:24.615
I'm not sick, so why am I getting an IV?

202
00:15:25.944 --> 00:15:27.855
How long was I asleep for?

203
00:15:28.615 --> 00:15:29.885
About 18 hours and a half.

204
00:15:29.885 --> 00:15:31.255
Really?

205
00:15:32.855 --> 00:15:34.155
Why didn't you tell me?

206
00:15:35.225 --> 00:15:36.225
About what?

207
00:15:36.355 --> 00:15:37.824
I heard the accident was big.

208
00:15:39.564 --> 00:15:41.464
The video was uploaded, so everyone knows about it.

209
00:15:43.334 --> 00:15:45.535
I should've taken away the phone and deleted it.

210
00:15:45.535 --> 00:15:47.834
Why did you make me hear it from others?

211
00:15:47.834 --> 00:15:49.275
I didn't want you to worry.

212
00:15:49.475 --> 00:15:50.745
I'm fine.

213
00:15:51.174 --> 00:15:52.544
Let's eat breakfast and go to Seoul already.

214
00:15:52.844 --> 00:15:54.914
Get yourself checked up from head to toe, okay?

215
00:15:54.914 --> 00:15:56.475
I said I'm okay. What's wrong with you?

216
00:15:56.475 --> 00:15:58.645
You shouldn't have hidden it from me.

217
00:15:58.814 --> 00:16:00.515
You came back, collapsed,

218
00:16:00.515 --> 00:16:01.954
and didn't even wake up.

219
00:16:02.385 --> 00:16:04.625
I was so worried that I called in a doctor.

220
00:16:05.084 --> 00:16:07.125
Why did you have to do that?

221
00:16:10.094 --> 00:16:11.424
I'm sorry.

222
00:16:11.594 --> 00:16:12.625
Don't be angry.

223
00:16:12.725 --> 00:16:13.735
Forget it.

224
00:16:19.735 --> 00:16:21.434
I'm sorry. I won't do that again.

225
00:16:22.475 --> 00:16:23.875
Let's go after you eat your meal.

226
00:16:24.074 --> 00:16:26.174
Let's leave the rent car and go to Seoul by bus.

227
00:16:34.655 --> 00:16:36.554
- Who are you? - We're the police.

228
00:16:37.554 --> 00:16:38.554
Hello.

229
00:16:39.924 --> 00:16:41.625
We searched through nearby CCTVs...

230
00:16:41.625 --> 00:16:43.155
and found the suspect.

231
00:16:47.995 --> 00:16:49.794
How many times do I have to tell you?

232
00:16:49.895 --> 00:16:53.105
Detective, I don't look like I'd commit a crime.

233
00:16:53.105 --> 00:16:56.535
Him and I being bald is the only similarity.

234
00:16:56.535 --> 00:16:58.475
That's not me.

235
00:16:58.574 --> 00:17:00.475
It's you for certain.

236
00:17:00.975 --> 00:17:02.875
You are definitely him.

237
00:17:09.785 --> 00:17:11.354
He's the car owner.

238
00:17:12.425 --> 00:17:14.354
Did you watch the video by any chance?

239
00:17:16.094 --> 00:17:17.495
Did Park Chul Min order you to do it?

240
00:17:18.294 --> 00:17:20.535
I don't know what you're talking about.

241
00:17:20.695 --> 00:17:22.634
I'm telling you. It's not me.

242
00:17:22.794 --> 00:17:23.804
Look.

243
00:17:24.134 --> 00:17:25.604
You keep denying...

244
00:17:25.604 --> 00:17:29.205
that the man in this photo isn't you.

245
00:17:29.304 --> 00:17:32.705
You don't even have an alibi for that time.

246
00:17:32.705 --> 00:17:35.675
I was watching TV at home.

247
00:17:36.675 --> 00:17:39.985
I only stayed at home since yesterday.

248
00:17:40.455 --> 00:17:41.915
Are you sure it's not you?

249
00:17:42.554 --> 00:17:44.054
I'm certain of it.

250
00:17:44.154 --> 00:17:46.025
It's obvious.

251
00:17:46.354 --> 00:17:47.854
I think it's you.

252
00:17:50.725 --> 00:17:52.925
Well, you need to wear glasses...

253
00:17:56.364 --> 00:17:57.665
What happened?

254
00:17:59.965 --> 00:18:01.634
What did he do just now?

255
00:18:02.404 --> 00:18:05.445
Where did you learn such silly stuff?

256
00:18:05.445 --> 00:18:07.344
You can't put up a show here.

257
00:18:07.844 --> 00:18:08.844
Come here.

258
00:18:13.985 --> 00:18:15.054
Goodness.

259
00:18:28.435 --> 00:18:30.364
Close the windows,

260
00:18:30.364 --> 00:18:31.834
and stop winds from blowing in.

261
00:18:31.834 --> 00:18:33.235
Goodness.

262
00:18:33.235 --> 00:18:34.235
The windows?

263
00:18:35.404 --> 00:18:36.675
They're not open.

264
00:18:37.574 --> 00:18:39.574
Do a background check on him again.

265
00:18:39.945 --> 00:18:42.415
He must be related to a theft case.

266
00:19:00.165 --> 00:19:01.195
I think...

267
00:19:01.195 --> 00:19:03.235
it's possible to develop this area...

268
00:19:03.495 --> 00:19:04.535
within two years.

269
00:19:06.705 --> 00:19:08.404
Give up on the persimmon tree town.

270
00:19:08.735 --> 00:19:10.235
Stay abroad for a few years.

271
00:19:10.604 --> 00:19:13.445
Why would I give up on this valuable town?

272
00:19:13.644 --> 00:19:14.915
For the time being,

273
00:19:15.945 --> 00:19:17.614
it'll be good for you to stay low.

274
00:19:20.084 --> 00:19:21.154
Mr. Chairman.

275
00:19:22.114 --> 00:19:23.455
Things aren't good.

276
00:19:23.455 --> 00:19:24.525
What's wrong?

277
00:19:24.925 --> 00:19:26.025
The police...

278
00:19:26.025 --> 00:19:27.025
What?

279
00:19:30.324 --> 00:19:31.425
We're the police.

280
00:19:32.794 --> 00:19:34.334
What brings you here?

281
00:19:34.334 --> 00:19:36.634
We're arresting you...

282
00:19:36.634 --> 00:19:38.505
for attempted murder against Moon Soo Ho.

283
00:19:38.735 --> 00:19:40.374
You have the right to an attorney.

284
00:19:40.374 --> 00:19:41.904
You have the right to remain silent.

285
00:19:41.904 --> 00:19:45.505
Anything you say can be used against you.

286
00:19:45.644 --> 00:19:46.775
Dad.

287
00:19:47.515 --> 00:19:48.745
Call my attorney.

288
00:19:48.975 --> 00:19:51.144
I'll be released within 48 hours.

289
00:19:51.185 --> 00:19:52.814
Don't make a fuss out of this.

290
00:19:53.044 --> 00:19:54.114
Let's go.

291
00:20:08.935 --> 00:20:11.165
As you can see, the man in the video...

292
00:20:11.165 --> 00:20:12.834
is Mr. Moon Soo Ho.

293
00:20:13.564 --> 00:20:14.904
The suspect was abetted by Chairman Park Chul Min...

294
00:20:14.904 --> 00:20:16.775
who was against the revival business...

295
00:20:16.775 --> 00:20:20.175
and broke the brakes of Mr. Moon's car on purpose.

296
00:20:20.544 --> 00:20:23.215
He confessed to his crime about an hour ago.

297
00:20:25.485 --> 00:20:27.114
Why hasn't Mr. Han called me yet?

298
00:20:28.755 --> 00:20:29.755
Are you tired?

299
00:20:30.554 --> 00:20:31.624
A little.

300
00:20:32.025 --> 00:20:33.025
Get some sleep.

301
00:20:34.755 --> 00:20:35.755
The West Seoul Prosecutors' Office...

302
00:20:35.755 --> 00:20:38.124
was investigating on Chairman Park...

303
00:20:38.364 --> 00:20:40.225
and his charges of the fire case...

304
00:20:40.225 --> 00:20:41.765
which led to Mr. Moon's father's death...

305
00:20:41.765 --> 00:20:43.064
and the death of Jung Gil Young,

306
00:20:43.495 --> 00:20:44.604
the father of Mr. Moon's wife.

307
00:20:44.604 --> 00:20:45.665
He's also charged...

308
00:20:45.834 --> 00:20:48.475
with embezzlement and tax evasion.

309
00:20:50.745 --> 00:20:53.005
If we preserve our town with the least we have...

310
00:20:53.475 --> 00:20:56.715
We're strongly against the redevelopment...

311
00:20:56.715 --> 00:20:59.644
led by this shameless and despicable businessman.

312
00:21:01.255 --> 00:21:02.654
We desperately ask the residents...

313
00:21:02.814 --> 00:21:05.755
to reconsider about the issue.

314
00:21:07.725 --> 00:21:09.695
Thank you.

315
00:21:09.695 --> 00:21:11.064
Great job, Mr. Han.

316
00:21:11.064 --> 00:21:13.794
Can you prepare everything to meet their investors?

317
00:21:14.195 --> 00:21:16.695
I'll call you when I get back. Okay.

318
00:21:19.104 --> 00:21:21.074
Everything is going well. Don't worry about it.

319
00:21:21.935 --> 00:21:23.435
How are you feeling?

320
00:21:23.745 --> 00:21:25.874
Your husband is in a great condition.

321
00:21:26.245 --> 00:21:28.515
But you have to go get a checkup.

322
00:21:28.874 --> 00:21:30.844
- I promise. - It's a promise.

323
00:21:33.985 --> 00:21:35.584
Do you have water?

324
00:21:35.985 --> 00:21:38.884
I have to take medicine, but I don't have any.

325
00:21:38.884 --> 00:21:41.225
You don't? Didn't you take it?

326
00:21:41.324 --> 00:21:44.265
I forgot. What do I do?

327
00:21:44.364 --> 00:21:45.695
Are you okay?

328
00:21:45.695 --> 00:21:47.564
Do you think we'll be in Seoul soon?

329
00:21:49.564 --> 00:21:52.705
Excuse me, if it's okay, you can take this.

330
00:21:52.965 --> 00:21:54.874
- Really? - Is that okay?

331
00:21:55.304 --> 00:21:57.344
- Thank you. - Thank you.

332
00:21:57.344 --> 00:21:58.475
No problem.

333
00:22:04.344 --> 00:22:05.614
Do you speak Japanese too?

334
00:22:09.314 --> 00:22:10.455
I guess so.

335
00:22:11.685 --> 00:22:13.624
How many languages do you speak?

336
00:22:37.945 --> 00:22:40.285
I'm sorry your honeymoon was ruined.

337
00:22:42.084 --> 00:22:43.455
We can always take another trip.

338
00:22:43.854 --> 00:22:46.384
I'm so thankful that he didn't get hurt.

339
00:22:46.525 --> 00:22:49.154
We went to see a doctor, and he said he's fine.

340
00:22:49.294 --> 00:22:50.425
I'm relieved.

341
00:22:51.465 --> 00:22:54.195
I think the accident made him sleep so much.

342
00:22:54.695 --> 00:22:58.005
I think his body is trying to recover by sleeping.

343
00:22:59.035 --> 00:23:00.735
Did you experience...

344
00:23:01.735 --> 00:23:03.435
anything weird when you were with him?

345
00:23:05.604 --> 00:23:07.215
Like what?

346
00:23:10.884 --> 00:23:13.084
Like tables suddenly shaking...

347
00:23:13.915 --> 00:23:16.054
or glasses breaking.

348
00:23:31.005 --> 00:23:32.005
I did.

349
00:23:35.404 --> 00:23:36.904
Ms. Jang, you're here.

350
00:23:37.975 --> 00:23:40.445
Hey, did you sleep well?

351
00:23:40.445 --> 00:23:42.515
I'm sorry. I must've fallen asleep.

352
00:23:43.074 --> 00:23:44.844
Was I knocked out for 10 hours again?

353
00:23:44.844 --> 00:23:46.415
No, just an hour.

354
00:23:47.354 --> 00:23:49.614
It looks like Soo Ho needs some energy.

355
00:23:49.614 --> 00:23:52.285
Should we eat something hearty?

356
00:23:52.925 --> 00:23:53.925
Okay.

357
00:23:58.965 --> 00:24:00.294
I'll get something.

358
00:24:16.445 --> 00:24:17.644
Your meat is ready.

359
00:24:18.144 --> 00:24:19.185
Thanks.

360
00:24:28.294 --> 00:24:29.854
Do you need anything else?

361
00:24:30.025 --> 00:24:31.165
No.

362
00:24:42.775 --> 00:24:44.175
I must have a reason...

363
00:24:45.074 --> 00:24:47.675
when I sent a newlywed bride out alone at night.

364
00:24:48.475 --> 00:24:50.074
Do it before Hae Ra comes back.

365
00:24:51.114 --> 00:24:52.144
Hae Ra...

366
00:24:52.814 --> 00:24:54.584
will get mad if I get hurt.

367
00:24:57.455 --> 00:24:59.824
Come on. Give it a try.

368
00:24:59.824 --> 00:25:00.955
Like this.

369
00:25:12.205 --> 00:25:13.904
Why do I have to do this?

370
00:25:14.804 --> 00:25:16.175
I have a feeling...

371
00:25:17.374 --> 00:25:19.705
that something has changed about you.

372
00:25:21.114 --> 00:25:22.745
I want to make sure.

373
00:25:41.794 --> 00:25:45.435
All guys that are strong enough can do this.

374
00:25:45.435 --> 00:25:46.505
But...

375
00:25:47.334 --> 00:25:50.205
it's hard to do so without a scratch.

376
00:25:56.675 --> 00:25:58.314
Turn off the lights in the kitchen.

377
00:26:00.614 --> 00:26:01.654
No.

378
00:26:02.554 --> 00:26:03.725
With your mind.

379
00:26:09.394 --> 00:26:11.725
- Ms. Jang. - I'm not joking around.

380
00:26:11.725 --> 00:26:12.864
Do it.

381
00:26:13.265 --> 00:26:15.064
Close your eyes or keep them open.

382
00:26:15.064 --> 00:26:17.765
Stay focused and turn the lights off.

383
00:26:26.044 --> 00:26:27.515
I don't believe in these things.

384
00:26:27.574 --> 00:26:28.844
And I don't want to.

385
00:26:28.844 --> 00:26:30.384
Will you just give it a try?

386
00:26:32.715 --> 00:26:34.384
Something odd did happen.

387
00:26:35.614 --> 00:26:38.654
I understood Japanese, which I never learned.

388
00:26:38.654 --> 00:26:40.495
And I spoke some too.

389
00:26:42.925 --> 00:26:46.025
The same thing happened to me before.

390
00:26:47.364 --> 00:26:48.735
I can't do this.

391
00:26:49.535 --> 00:26:51.005
Some people suddenly develop...

392
00:26:51.005 --> 00:26:53.104
great mental power after a huge accident.

393
00:26:53.104 --> 00:26:54.404
I'm sure that's the case.

394
00:26:54.604 --> 00:26:56.205
Try to turn off the lights.

395
00:26:56.505 --> 00:26:58.144
I don't want to, Ms. Jang.

396
00:27:01.415 --> 00:27:03.015
What's on your mind?

397
00:27:07.915 --> 00:27:10.955
I'm sorry. It's hard to be with you today.

398
00:27:10.955 --> 00:27:12.425
Hae Ra will be home soon.

399
00:28:09.314 --> 00:28:10.485
Goodness.

400
00:28:10.715 --> 00:28:11.814
I'm sorry.

401
00:28:11.814 --> 00:28:13.685
I accidentally broke a glass.

402
00:28:13.685 --> 00:28:15.685
It's okay. Leave it. I'll clean it up.

403
00:28:16.654 --> 00:28:20.084
I'm so sorry, but I'm not feeling well.

404
00:28:20.285 --> 00:28:21.695
I have to go.

405
00:28:21.894 --> 00:28:23.725
What are your symptoms?

406
00:28:23.725 --> 00:28:25.064
I'll get you some medicine.

407
00:28:25.394 --> 00:28:29.265
No. I think I should call it a day.

408
00:28:29.265 --> 00:28:31.005
Where's Soo Ho?

409
00:28:33.364 --> 00:28:35.035
He seemed busy with work.

410
00:28:35.874 --> 00:28:38.675
He shouldn't treat our officiant like this.

411
00:28:39.245 --> 00:28:41.574
Soo Ho! What are you doing?

412
00:28:42.644 --> 00:28:43.685
Goodness.

413
00:28:44.114 --> 00:28:45.584
What's with these lights?

414
00:28:52.425 --> 00:28:54.025
Something must be broken.

415
00:29:02.165 --> 00:29:03.334
Soo Ho.

416
00:29:05.104 --> 00:29:06.364
Did you just see that?

417
00:29:06.804 --> 00:29:09.035
Where can I call to get some help?

418
00:29:11.445 --> 00:29:12.804
I did that, Hae Ra.

419
00:29:23.185 --> 00:29:24.185
Ms. Jang.

420
00:29:25.324 --> 00:29:26.854
What do I have to do now?

421
00:29:31.878 --> 00:29:36.878
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E19 Black Knight "Lift Your Curse"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

422
00:29:42.404 --> 00:29:44.044
This is odd.

423
00:29:46.074 --> 00:29:47.874
You suddenly got a lot of them.

424
00:29:50.445 --> 00:29:52.114
It's something I always wished for.

425
00:29:57.255 --> 00:29:59.185
But I'm not happy at all.

426
00:30:00.025 --> 00:30:03.054
Be quiet. I have to stay focused.

427
00:30:16.435 --> 00:30:18.804
I went through the same thing before.

428
00:30:20.074 --> 00:30:21.475
One day,

429
00:30:21.915 --> 00:30:24.114
I suddenly became very strong.

430
00:30:24.445 --> 00:30:26.685
After I used my power, I'd get very sleepy.

431
00:30:27.554 --> 00:30:29.814
I could control the lamps as I wished.

432
00:30:30.854 --> 00:30:31.955
Back then,

433
00:30:33.124 --> 00:30:35.094
I had no idea...

434
00:30:36.525 --> 00:30:38.665
that I became someone who doesn't...

435
00:30:39.324 --> 00:30:40.935
grow old or die.

436
00:30:44.665 --> 00:30:46.975
What do you mean by that?

437
00:30:48.874 --> 00:30:51.344
Are you saying Soo Ho is like that now?

438
00:30:53.544 --> 00:30:55.415
I really hope I'm worried for nothing.

439
00:30:55.915 --> 00:30:57.344
Why would that happen to me?

440
00:30:59.515 --> 00:31:01.084
I didn't do anything wrong.

441
00:31:09.054 --> 00:31:10.894
This makes no sense.

442
00:31:12.265 --> 00:31:13.695
Please don't say that.

443
00:31:14.465 --> 00:31:16.334
We'll be able to tell...

444
00:31:16.334 --> 00:31:18.435
if I grow old or not after 10 or 20 years.

445
00:31:18.465 --> 00:31:19.564
We can't tell...

446
00:31:19.765 --> 00:31:21.404
in a month or two.

447
00:31:26.344 --> 00:31:27.374
I don't want to spend...

448
00:31:27.374 --> 00:31:29.915
10 years stressing over it.

449
00:31:33.915 --> 00:31:35.814
I shouldn't have brought it up...

450
00:31:38.025 --> 00:31:40.255
to such beautiful newlyweds.

451
00:32:10.285 --> 00:32:12.154
Should we go traveling when it gets warmer?

452
00:32:17.864 --> 00:32:19.695
How about checking out the southern provinces?

453
00:32:20.594 --> 00:32:22.965
Like Yeosu, Mokpo, and Gwangju.

454
00:32:24.465 --> 00:32:25.465
Okay.

455
00:32:25.735 --> 00:32:27.374
Let's go there, enjoy great food,

456
00:32:27.374 --> 00:32:28.574
and have fun.

457
00:32:31.604 --> 00:32:32.705
Soo Ho.

458
00:32:34.074 --> 00:32:35.074
Yes?

459
00:32:38.844 --> 00:32:41.884
Make me float in the air.

460
00:32:44.884 --> 00:32:47.554
Come on. Do something and make me levitate.

461
00:32:48.294 --> 00:32:50.324
I'm not in the mood for making jokes.

462
00:32:52.324 --> 00:32:53.525
That means you can't do it.

463
00:32:53.794 --> 00:32:55.364
No, I can't.

464
00:32:57.104 --> 00:32:58.804
Then I'm relieved.

465
00:32:59.634 --> 00:33:02.005
Even if you can, that's okay.

466
00:33:02.035 --> 00:33:03.374
It's no problem.

467
00:33:04.044 --> 00:33:06.005
Only you and I will know.

468
00:33:14.614 --> 00:33:17.255
Even if something undesirable happens,

469
00:33:17.455 --> 00:33:18.755
there will be a way to solve it.

470
00:33:19.425 --> 00:33:21.154
Because I've always been lucky.

471
00:33:22.755 --> 00:33:23.894
Of course.

472
00:33:25.225 --> 00:33:27.465
Don't worry. I'm here.

473
00:33:32.604 --> 00:33:33.675
Hold me.

474
00:33:48.554 --> 00:33:50.884
Chairman Park's investors withdrew...

475
00:33:50.884 --> 00:33:53.154
from participating in the consortium.

476
00:33:53.525 --> 00:33:55.654
The banks have canceled the loans.

477
00:33:56.725 --> 00:33:58.425
Geumseong-dong redevelopment business...

478
00:33:58.465 --> 00:33:59.894
fell through completely.

479
00:34:03.634 --> 00:34:05.665
People don't have good opinions of Chairman Park.

480
00:34:06.404 --> 00:34:08.835
Your car accident was a huge shock.

481
00:34:09.574 --> 00:34:11.705
Everyone is furious because they found out...

482
00:34:11.705 --> 00:34:13.274
that he terrorized you at the hearing.

483
00:34:14.015 --> 00:34:16.145
Even if the warrant isn't issued in 48 hours,

484
00:34:16.415 --> 00:34:18.315
he'll be arrested for something else.

485
00:34:18.815 --> 00:34:21.515
What did I tell you?

486
00:34:22.285 --> 00:34:23.855
Don't be scared of something like this...

487
00:34:23.855 --> 00:34:25.384
when you do business.

488
00:34:26.125 --> 00:34:27.455
Redeveloping the persimmon tree town...

489
00:34:27.594 --> 00:34:28.855
is over.

490
00:34:29.424 --> 00:34:30.524
You should let it go.

491
00:34:31.895 --> 00:34:33.495
You're so timid.

492
00:34:33.694 --> 00:34:36.694
You never know what's going to happen.

493
00:34:37.964 --> 00:34:39.665
The weather's nice.

494
00:34:39.734 --> 00:34:42.335
Let's go have some hangover soup.

495
00:34:59.654 --> 00:35:00.754
Over here, Hae Ra.

496
00:35:10.304 --> 00:35:11.404
Aren't you busy?

497
00:35:11.535 --> 00:35:14.134
I am, but I still wanted to see you.

498
00:35:15.835 --> 00:35:17.245
How is your husband?

499
00:35:17.475 --> 00:35:18.574
Is he all right?

500
00:35:18.574 --> 00:35:20.174
Would you be happy if he wasn't?

501
00:35:20.444 --> 00:35:22.515
Don't say it like that.

502
00:35:23.685 --> 00:35:25.815
Gon feels terrible too.

503
00:35:25.815 --> 00:35:27.214
That's why he couldn't come here.

504
00:35:27.214 --> 00:35:28.554
He feels really bad.

505
00:35:28.855 --> 00:35:30.185
He was released because...

506
00:35:30.185 --> 00:35:32.154
a warrant for an attempted murder wasn't issued.

507
00:35:32.625 --> 00:35:34.094
He'll get arrested soon.

508
00:35:34.725 --> 00:35:36.324
So brace yourself.

509
00:35:37.694 --> 00:35:40.734
Hae Ra. Let's not talk about that today.

510
00:35:41.065 --> 00:35:43.835
We're having lunch as friends after the wedding.

511
00:35:48.535 --> 00:35:50.375
Thanks for coming to my wedding.

512
00:35:51.804 --> 00:35:54.145
I was jealous because you looked so happy.

513
00:36:00.855 --> 00:36:02.015
Long time no see.

514
00:36:05.085 --> 00:36:07.254
She called me today.

515
00:36:07.694 --> 00:36:08.995
I told her I was having lunch with you,

516
00:36:08.995 --> 00:36:10.424
and she said she'd come.

517
00:36:12.924 --> 00:36:15.234
I wanted to give you your wedding gift.

518
00:36:18.364 --> 00:36:19.535
Congratulations.

519
00:36:21.234 --> 00:36:22.574
I was upset...

520
00:36:23.234 --> 00:36:25.105
because you didn't invite me.

521
00:36:25.205 --> 00:36:27.074
What are you trying to do this time?

522
00:36:29.714 --> 00:36:31.585
Hae Ra, you've changed a lot.

523
00:36:35.185 --> 00:36:37.484
I heard Moon Soo Ho became a monster.

524
00:36:37.855 --> 00:36:40.554
A ghost of the netherworld shouldn't be saying that.

525
00:36:42.955 --> 00:36:44.864
I'm back to normal.

526
00:36:47.234 --> 00:36:50.165
He will stay young and lonely forever.

527
00:36:51.134 --> 00:36:53.565
He'll watch you grow old and die.

528
00:37:06.685 --> 00:37:07.685
Excuse me.

529
00:37:08.714 --> 00:37:11.384
We aren't interested in what you say anymore.

530
00:37:12.524 --> 00:37:14.254
Grow old gracefully, please.

531
00:37:17.125 --> 00:37:18.125
Hae Ra.

532
00:37:18.225 --> 00:37:19.295
Hae Ra!

533
00:37:21.535 --> 00:37:22.535
I guess...

534
00:37:22.535 --> 00:37:24.605
something happened between you two.

535
00:37:27.574 --> 00:37:29.904
I didn't know you had so much Grey hair.

536
00:37:30.274 --> 00:37:31.674
I didn't notice it before.

537
00:37:33.045 --> 00:37:34.074
Hae Ra!

538
00:37:38.984 --> 00:37:40.085
Hello.

539
00:37:40.855 --> 00:37:43.315
Hi. It's been so long.

540
00:37:52.625 --> 00:37:53.734
This...

541
00:37:54.895 --> 00:37:56.364
is from here, right?

542
00:38:01.404 --> 00:38:02.475
This was...

543
00:38:02.475 --> 00:38:04.004
very difficult to make.

544
00:38:05.074 --> 00:38:07.174
Someone must've given it to you as a gift.

545
00:38:08.114 --> 00:38:10.344
It doesn't look like an ordinary silver knife.

546
00:38:10.344 --> 00:38:12.515
She brought an old ring, and asked me...

547
00:38:12.515 --> 00:38:15.384
to melt it to make a new blade.

548
00:38:18.554 --> 00:38:20.524
Did the ring look like this?

549
00:38:28.234 --> 00:38:29.435
Yes.

550
00:38:29.765 --> 00:38:31.535
This is a copy...

551
00:38:31.835 --> 00:38:33.634
I made here for her.

552
00:38:43.745 --> 00:38:45.844
Seo Rin told me a long time ago...

553
00:38:46.315 --> 00:38:47.884
that Boon Yi...

554
00:38:47.984 --> 00:38:51.285
wished upon the full moon and the ring.

555
00:38:51.424 --> 00:38:53.185
When you two were in exile,

556
00:38:53.824 --> 00:38:55.924
perhaps the prayer in the ring...

557
00:38:56.625 --> 00:38:58.594
went into the knife too.

558
00:39:00.094 --> 00:39:01.234
Her wish wasn't mentioned...

559
00:39:01.234 --> 00:39:03.594
in Jeom Bok's painting or letter of prayer.

560
00:39:03.964 --> 00:39:05.165
No, it wasn't.

561
00:39:06.364 --> 00:39:08.634
Since she made that wish when we were exiled,

562
00:39:08.774 --> 00:39:10.944
it must be about returning home safely...

563
00:39:11.304 --> 00:39:14.245
or not being parted even after returning home.

564
00:39:15.245 --> 00:39:16.515
You're probably right.

565
00:39:17.085 --> 00:39:20.085
She must've prayed for you two to not be separated.

566
00:39:31.864 --> 00:39:33.225
What is it?

567
00:39:35.765 --> 00:39:37.105
Hurry up and say it.

568
00:39:40.304 --> 00:39:41.304
I...

569
00:39:42.674 --> 00:39:44.875
can't go to the office in Rome.

570
00:39:45.705 --> 00:39:46.745
Why not?

571
00:39:47.015 --> 00:39:48.574
Did Mr. Moon tell you not to go?

572
00:39:49.915 --> 00:39:52.415
That's not it. He actually encouraged me to go.

573
00:39:52.614 --> 00:39:54.355
I made this decision on my own.

574
00:39:54.355 --> 00:39:56.515
You really wanted to go to the office abroad.

575
00:39:56.754 --> 00:39:57.984
What's the real reason?

576
00:39:59.484 --> 00:40:02.424
I want to be with my husband more.

577
00:40:04.094 --> 00:40:06.895
I'll try again next time.

578
00:40:13.674 --> 00:40:15.734
- Does that make sense? - They're newlyweds.

579
00:40:21.574 --> 00:40:24.344
I dyed my hair yesterday. Why is it like this?

580
00:40:29.415 --> 00:40:31.754
People are taking pictures outside.

581
00:40:32.754 --> 00:40:34.395
They don't look like tourists.

582
00:40:35.725 --> 00:40:37.094
I think they're reporters.

583
00:40:37.765 --> 00:40:39.065
Taking pictures?

584
00:40:39.065 --> 00:40:40.065
Yes.

585
00:40:45.435 --> 00:40:47.274
Hello, Seo Rin.

586
00:40:48.274 --> 00:40:50.504
I've suffered a lot in the lockup.

587
00:40:50.674 --> 00:40:52.045
But now I'm released.

588
00:40:56.245 --> 00:40:57.484
What brings you here?

589
00:41:03.484 --> 00:41:05.554
How can I do that?

590
00:41:05.955 --> 00:41:07.355
You have a lot of properties...

591
00:41:07.355 --> 00:41:08.594
and buildings in that town.

592
00:41:08.594 --> 00:41:10.254
I know you can be influential.

593
00:41:10.254 --> 00:41:12.225
Everything went in vain because of you.

594
00:41:12.795 --> 00:41:15.694
You became a shameless and despicable swindler.

595
00:41:16.395 --> 00:41:18.004
You ordered me...

596
00:41:18.364 --> 00:41:20.004
to kill Moon Soo Ho.

597
00:41:21.504 --> 00:41:22.774
When did I?

598
00:41:22.774 --> 00:41:25.045
You instigated me saying,

599
00:41:25.045 --> 00:41:26.375
"I want you to be richer."

600
00:41:26.804 --> 00:41:30.045
You told me to get rid of everything in my way.

601
00:41:31.844 --> 00:41:33.085
I never said that.

602
00:41:36.054 --> 00:41:37.254
I brought four cameramen with me.

603
00:41:37.625 --> 00:41:40.185
They're waiting outside.

604
00:41:40.654 --> 00:41:42.225
If you don't help me,

605
00:41:42.225 --> 00:41:44.565
I'll reveal everything.

606
00:41:57.304 --> 00:41:58.944
I'll tell them that Choi Seo Rin is immortal...

607
00:41:58.944 --> 00:42:01.515
and that she's behind this accident.

608
00:42:05.045 --> 00:42:07.654
Please sign the redevelopment agreement.

609
00:42:08.114 --> 00:42:10.054
Do that for me, Seo Rin.

610
00:42:11.585 --> 00:42:13.024
If you can't do it,

611
00:42:14.154 --> 00:42:16.654
teach me your secret...

612
00:42:17.295 --> 00:42:18.924
to stay immortal.

613
00:42:20.935 --> 00:42:23.904
I have a lot to do,

614
00:42:24.605 --> 00:42:25.705
but sometimes,

615
00:42:27.274 --> 00:42:29.375
I feel too weak and unhealthy.

616
00:42:30.844 --> 00:42:32.404
I'll count on you.

617
00:42:49.054 --> 00:42:50.094
Soo Ho.

618
00:42:52.565 --> 00:42:54.464
I told the company...

619
00:42:55.194 --> 00:42:57.105
that I wouldn't work in the office in Rome.

620
00:42:59.265 --> 00:43:00.335
Why?

621
00:43:00.605 --> 00:43:02.105
I don't want to stay apart from you.

622
00:43:08.714 --> 00:43:10.315
I thought you'd be happy to hear it.

623
00:43:11.145 --> 00:43:12.984
Why did you make such a decision alone?

624
00:43:14.855 --> 00:43:16.114
I'm your husband.

625
00:43:16.114 --> 00:43:18.785
If it's important to you, it's important to me too.

626
00:43:19.785 --> 00:43:20.955
Why did you decide it on your own?

627
00:43:20.955 --> 00:43:22.154
And why are you announcing it to me now?

628
00:43:22.654 --> 00:43:24.995
Announcing? How could you say that?

629
00:43:25.824 --> 00:43:27.895
I didn't give up on it because I wanted to.

630
00:43:28.395 --> 00:43:29.995
What changed your mind?

631
00:43:32.864 --> 00:43:34.105
I was worried.

632
00:43:34.105 --> 00:43:35.134
About what?

633
00:43:35.134 --> 00:43:36.674
How can I not be worried...

634
00:43:36.674 --> 00:43:37.975
after seeing such a thing yesterday?

635
00:43:37.975 --> 00:43:39.304
I'm still the same.

636
00:43:39.504 --> 00:43:41.015
And nothing happened today.

637
00:43:45.915 --> 00:43:46.915
All right.

638
00:43:47.654 --> 00:43:49.754
I did it because I wanted to stay with you.

639
00:43:51.125 --> 00:43:52.424
Are you satisfied now?

640
00:44:45.475 --> 00:44:47.444
I'm sorry that I made you worry.

641
00:44:50.315 --> 00:44:51.384
It's okay.

642
00:44:54.015 --> 00:44:56.585
I was too childish to think that you'd like it.

643
00:44:59.685 --> 00:45:01.795
I expected you'd be happy to hear...

644
00:45:02.054 --> 00:45:04.225
that I wouldn't go. That's why I got upset.

645
00:45:06.194 --> 00:45:07.535
Of course I'm happy.

646
00:45:09.364 --> 00:45:10.835
But I'm sorry at the same time.

647
00:45:13.804 --> 00:45:16.535
Something unpleasant happened to me today.

648
00:45:17.504 --> 00:45:19.475
I met Young Mi for lunch.

649
00:45:19.475 --> 00:45:21.274
And Sharon showed up,

650
00:45:21.975 --> 00:45:24.085
saying she prepared a wedding gift for me.

651
00:45:25.645 --> 00:45:27.815
I heard Moon Soo Ho became a monster.

652
00:45:28.884 --> 00:45:31.785
He will stay young and lonely forever.

653
00:45:32.824 --> 00:45:35.225
He'll watch you grow old and die.

654
00:45:37.165 --> 00:45:39.094
She said that in front of Young Mi?

655
00:45:39.364 --> 00:45:40.395
Yes.

656
00:45:41.535 --> 00:45:44.205
I don't think Baek Hee told her about it.

657
00:45:44.205 --> 00:45:46.435
She must've done it after watching the video.

658
00:45:49.734 --> 00:45:50.875
Forget it.

659
00:45:51.975 --> 00:45:54.975
If she appears again, I'll report her to the police.

660
00:46:10.295 --> 00:46:11.765
Hae Ra, I'll step outside for a bit.

661
00:46:12.924 --> 00:46:13.995
What?

662
00:46:43.225 --> 00:46:44.594
I warned you.

663
00:46:44.594 --> 00:46:46.625
I have no regrets about you anymore.

664
00:46:46.625 --> 00:46:48.864
I wanted to see how you've become a monster.

665
00:46:49.435 --> 00:46:51.134
If you show up in front of Hae Ra again,

666
00:46:51.734 --> 00:46:53.364
I won't let it slide.

667
00:46:54.705 --> 00:46:57.375
The prayer carried in the ring made you like that.

668
00:46:58.844 --> 00:47:00.844
I heard you outside the door at that time.

669
00:47:00.844 --> 00:47:03.375
Shut it. I didn't come here to hear you talk.

670
00:47:03.545 --> 00:47:04.685
Boon Yi's prayer...

671
00:47:04.685 --> 00:47:06.585
If you show up before Hae Ra one more time,

672
00:47:07.984 --> 00:47:10.285
I'll expose your secret to everyone.

673
00:47:10.924 --> 00:47:12.125
You better think through.

674
00:47:14.024 --> 00:47:15.594
It's simple to lift the curse.

675
00:47:16.824 --> 00:47:18.395
If you break up with Hae Ra...

676
00:47:19.594 --> 00:47:22.364
If you cut ties, you can escape from that curse.

677
00:47:37.415 --> 00:47:39.214
No matter what happens,

678
00:47:41.214 --> 00:47:43.384
I will never break up with her.

679
00:47:46.285 --> 00:47:47.995
I'll stay with her until the end.

680
00:47:58.234 --> 00:48:01.304
You don't know how painful it is to live forever.

681
00:48:45.815 --> 00:48:47.285
What have you done?

682
00:48:55.995 --> 00:48:57.895
I hope you get old slowly like that.

683
00:49:00.864 --> 00:49:02.265
Let's not see each other again.

684
00:49:18.085 --> 00:49:19.185
Soo Ho?

685
00:49:20.085 --> 00:49:21.254
Why aren't you sleeping?

686
00:49:21.785 --> 00:49:23.855
Where did you go?

687
00:49:24.085 --> 00:49:25.455
Did something happen?

688
00:49:28.154 --> 00:49:30.295
Choi Seo Rin won't show up again.

689
00:49:30.824 --> 00:49:31.895
What?

690
00:49:54.315 --> 00:49:55.984
It wasn't like this for Baek Hee.

691
00:49:59.324 --> 00:50:00.455
This isn't right.

692
00:51:00.185 --> 00:51:01.455
I prayed...

693
00:51:03.154 --> 00:51:06.054
they would not ask you to drink poison.

694
00:51:10.094 --> 00:51:12.324
This is a ring with your dearest wish.

695
00:51:12.524 --> 00:51:14.694
It should be touching my body.

696
00:51:20.535 --> 00:51:22.105
Do not die.

697
00:51:23.335 --> 00:51:24.645
I will not die.

698
00:51:25.944 --> 00:51:26.975
Never.

699
00:51:29.674 --> 00:51:30.685
Not ever.

700
00:52:13.254 --> 00:52:14.395
Hae Ra.

701
00:52:15.154 --> 00:52:16.324
Hello, Ms. Jang.

702
00:52:17.265 --> 00:52:18.265
I...

703
00:52:18.594 --> 00:52:21.364
just had a weird dream.

704
00:52:23.035 --> 00:52:24.835
And it was so odd.

705
00:52:25.705 --> 00:52:26.734
I think...

706
00:52:27.804 --> 00:52:29.774
I just saw the same thing.

707
00:52:32.105 --> 00:52:34.114
May I come over right now?

708
00:52:45.984 --> 00:52:47.094
Hae Ra.

709
00:52:54.694 --> 00:52:55.835
(I'm going over to Ms. Jang's.)

710
00:53:05.475 --> 00:53:06.504
Come in.

711
00:53:21.024 --> 00:53:22.795
Did you also see...

712
00:53:23.795 --> 00:53:25.495
what I saw in my dream?

713
00:53:30.665 --> 00:53:32.165
Was he not killed...

714
00:53:32.165 --> 00:53:33.734
because that ring had Boon Yi's wish?

715
00:53:36.435 --> 00:53:38.804
So will he have to live forever now?

716
00:53:40.515 --> 00:53:41.574
No.

717
00:53:42.245 --> 00:53:43.245
This is...

718
00:53:43.645 --> 00:53:45.145
not your fault.

719
00:53:47.685 --> 00:53:49.384
He will come back to his place...

720
00:53:49.384 --> 00:53:51.085
only after all ties are cut off with you.

721
00:53:52.254 --> 00:53:53.694
If you are with him,

722
00:53:54.154 --> 00:53:56.455
he'll have to live on just like us.

723
00:53:57.924 --> 00:53:59.094
Get out of here!

724
00:54:04.835 --> 00:54:06.705
Why do you have that?

725
00:54:08.335 --> 00:54:09.335
Give it back to me.

726
00:54:21.585 --> 00:54:23.054
What's wrong with your hand?

727
00:54:28.824 --> 00:54:30.225
Fix this.

728
00:54:30.594 --> 00:54:31.995
Your hand isn't like this.

729
00:54:31.995 --> 00:54:33.225
Why's mine like this?

730
00:54:35.565 --> 00:54:38.065
You're getting punished and returning to your age.

731
00:54:48.344 --> 00:54:49.674
It's all because of you.

732
00:55:07.065 --> 00:55:08.295
Stop it already.

733
00:55:08.734 --> 00:55:09.964
It's time to stop.

734
00:55:10.265 --> 00:55:11.605
Put an end to this.

735
00:55:13.565 --> 00:55:15.634
Why is no one on my side?

736
00:55:17.344 --> 00:55:18.404
Why?

737
00:55:36.824 --> 00:55:38.024
You really have...

738
00:55:38.995 --> 00:55:40.594
become a monster.

739
00:55:41.535 --> 00:55:44.165
You should have left me to live as a beggar's kid.

740
00:55:48.004 --> 00:55:49.004
Fine.

741
00:55:49.705 --> 00:55:51.105
Just kill me.

742
00:55:51.545 --> 00:55:52.674
Kill me...

743
00:55:53.045 --> 00:55:54.344
and vent your spite.

744
00:56:18.234 --> 00:56:19.364
Ms. Jang.

745
00:56:38.924 --> 00:56:40.924
I will kill you.

746
00:56:43.524 --> 00:56:44.725
Are you crazy?

747
00:57:45.384 --> 00:57:46.384
Are you okay?

748
00:57:48.654 --> 00:57:49.824
Ms. Jang is...

749
00:57:51.194 --> 00:57:53.065
- Ms. Jang. - Ms. Jang.

750
00:57:55.835 --> 00:57:56.835
Ms. Jang.

751
00:58:01.375 --> 00:58:03.475
Everything...

752
00:58:06.444 --> 00:58:08.714
is over.

753
00:58:15.114 --> 00:58:16.285
Soo Ho.

754
00:58:17.824 --> 00:58:18.984
Yes, Ms. Jang.

755
00:58:25.265 --> 00:58:26.694
I want...

756
00:58:29.435 --> 00:58:30.835
you two...

757
00:58:32.864 --> 00:58:35.535
to be happy forever.

758
00:58:40.875 --> 00:58:43.444
No matter what happens.

759
00:58:57.524 --> 00:58:58.524
Ms. Jang.

760
00:59:17.444 --> 00:59:18.444
Ms. Jang.

761
00:59:25.125 --> 00:59:26.125
Ms. Jang...

762
00:59:33.634 --> 00:59:34.995
(The last episode will be aired tomorrow.)
