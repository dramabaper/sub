00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.124
Do you get it now?

3
00:00:27.304 --> 00:00:30.010
The person who should've
gotten on that boat on that day...

4
00:00:30.437 --> 00:00:32.068
was me.

5
00:00:32.773 --> 00:00:36.257
If only I hadn't given your mother
my ferry ticket

6
00:00:36.257 --> 00:00:37.825
then...

7
00:00:38.712 --> 00:00:40.370
so...

8
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.566
don't you ever forgive me.

9
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:44.999
Hate me and resent me...

10
00:00:46.315 --> 00:00:49.124
and when you get tired of hating me...

11
00:00:51.531 --> 00:00:53.321
when that time comes...

12
00:00:53.321 --> 00:00:55.062
just forget about everything.

13
00:00:57.254 --> 00:00:59.187
I'll forever live on...

14
00:00:59.752 --> 00:01:01.900
without ever forgetting.

<i>and everything...</i>

20
00:02:35.454 --> 00:02:37.939
<i>ended with this note.</i>

21
00:02:38.857 --> 00:02:41.193
This makes no sense.

22
00:02:42.645 --> 00:02:45.900
How is it that the only person
who can't say...

23
00:02:47.218 --> 00:02:49.987
that I'm glad that nothing
happened to her...

24
00:02:51.236 --> 00:02:54.560
and that I'm glad that she's safe...

25
00:02:56.965 --> 00:02:59.305
is me, of all people?

26
00:03:02.703 --> 00:03:04.066
How?

27
00:03:21.936 --> 00:03:26.389
When, in the function f(x),
x equals a...

28
00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:32.145
and when the value of f(x)
approaches the value of a...

29
00:03:32.145 --> 00:03:34.175
- Huh?
- Whose is that?

30
00:03:34.175 --> 00:03:35.374
it becomes a divergent sequence.

31
00:03:35.374 --> 00:03:36.493
Mr. Kang.

32
00:03:36.493 --> 00:03:38.292
I think that's your phone.

33
00:03:38.292 --> 00:03:39.636
Huh?

34
00:03:43.447 --> 00:03:44.636
Oh.

35
00:03:44.636 --> 00:03:45.894
Just a second.

36
00:03:47.424 --> 00:03:49.903
Aren't you neglecting me a bit too much?

37
00:03:49.903 --> 00:03:51.405
What kind of guardian are you?

38
00:03:51.405 --> 00:03:54.346
You've been leaving a minor all alone
by himself for several days.

39
00:03:54.346 --> 00:03:56.695
I've been busy
because of school.

40
00:03:56.695 --> 00:03:57.899
What is it?

41
00:03:57.899 --> 00:04:00.072
- They said that I can be discharged.
- Really?

42
00:04:00.072 --> 00:04:02.206
Want me to go to the hospital?

43
00:04:02.206 --> 00:04:04.818
No. I took care of all of the
discharge procedures.

44
00:04:04.818 --> 00:04:06.529
I'll be at home.

45
00:04:06.529 --> 00:04:07.660
All right.

46
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.694
Um...

47
00:04:09.694 --> 00:04:11.904
have you seen Ji Soo lately?

48
00:04:11.904 --> 00:04:14.296
I see her right now.

49
00:04:15.772 --> 00:04:18.911
<i>I'm only telling you this because I don't
want to keep this bottled up inside me</i>

50
00:04:18.911 --> 00:04:22.733
<i>but I haven't been able to talk to her
properly these past couple of days.</i>

51
00:04:23.161 --> 00:04:24.279
Because...

52
00:04:24.776 --> 00:04:28.771
she's been in the ER for the past couple
of days without eating or resting.

53
00:04:32.887 --> 00:04:35.533
<i>You said that you wanted to
see me, right?</i>

54
00:04:35.533 --> 00:04:37.046
Well, I...

55
00:04:38.012 --> 00:04:40.808
lived all this time, hoping that
I wouldn't see you.

56
00:04:40.808 --> 00:04:42.789
Remember what I said last time?

57
00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:45.038
About how we should never
see each other again?

58
00:04:46.221 --> 00:04:48.089
I meant that.

59
00:04:54.916 --> 00:04:56.502
<i>Me first, me first!</i>

60
00:04:56.502 --> 00:04:58.108
- Me first!
- No, me!

61
00:04:58.108 --> 00:05:00.240
- Me too, me too!
- My name is Seo Joon.

62
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.342
Just a second.

63
00:05:01.342 --> 00:05:02.399
Me too, me too!

64
00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:03.694
Wow, thank you!

65
00:05:04.329 --> 00:05:06.642
What are you all doing?
Aren't you going back to the classroom?

66
00:05:06.642 --> 00:05:08.454
- Ugh.
- Man.

67
00:05:09.884 --> 00:05:11.144
Eh?

68
00:05:13.618 --> 00:05:14.909
Why did you come to school?

69
00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:17.106
I told you that I was coming
to the school today.

70
00:05:17.777 --> 00:05:18.873
Oh.

71
00:05:18.873 --> 00:05:21.724
Mokzart called me in.

72
00:05:21.724 --> 00:05:24.000
He wanted me to do that thing...
what's it called?

73
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.550
It's that thing... uh, "dotori!"
(means "acorn")

74
00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:27.024
You mean, "mentoring?"

75
00:05:27.024 --> 00:05:28.586
Yeah, that!
Yep.

76
00:05:28.586 --> 00:05:29.839
Jeez.

77
00:05:31.875 --> 00:05:33.575
I wonder if those kids know...

78
00:05:34.057 --> 00:05:37.382
that you can't even tell the difference
between "mentoring" and "dotori."

79
00:05:38.038 --> 00:05:41.051
You're not going to tell them, are you?

80
00:05:45.527 --> 00:05:46.743
Wow.

81
00:05:46.743 --> 00:05:48.714
This really takes me back.

82
00:05:48.714 --> 00:05:50.582
You must feel like you're back
in high school every day

83
00:05:50.582 --> 00:05:52.082
when you look at them.

84
00:05:54.846 --> 00:05:57.449
Oh yeah, I went to
Min Seok's house yesterday.

85
00:05:58.396 --> 00:06:01.200
Do you really
still like Ji Soo?

86
00:06:02.353 --> 00:06:03.418
Hey.

87
00:06:03.418 --> 00:06:05.479
Why not give it
another shot with her, then?

88
00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:07.111
It was really nice...

89
00:06:07.783 --> 00:06:09.425
back when we were that age.

90
00:06:13.755 --> 00:06:16.305
When we were out there together

91
00:06:16.305 --> 00:06:18.998
and when I was watching
you guys from here...

92
00:06:19.481 --> 00:06:21.445
I was really happy.

93
00:06:23.728 --> 00:06:25.546
That really was...

94
00:06:26.471 --> 00:06:28.471
the happiest time of my life.

95
00:06:29.051 --> 00:06:30.361
And so...

96
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.887
I've decided to be
satisfied...

97
00:06:34.587 --> 00:06:36.346
with just that.

98
00:06:36.346 --> 00:06:37.760
What are you talking about?

99
00:06:38.858 --> 00:06:40.777
I liked Ji Soo.

100
00:06:42.045 --> 00:06:43.654
I liked her.

101
00:06:46.913 --> 00:06:49.926
I have to go to class now,
so I'll be going now.

102
00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.312
You can look around the
school more if you want.

103
00:07:23.365 --> 00:07:24.365
Huh?

104
00:07:24.634 --> 00:07:26.707
Wasn't that book your most
treasured possession?

105
00:07:26.707 --> 00:07:28.202
I'm going to get rid of it.

106
00:07:28.716 --> 00:07:30.882
Because I'm never
going to read it again.

107
00:07:44.142 --> 00:07:46.348
<i>Now, everything really is...</i>

108
00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.217
<i>over.</i>

109
00:07:49.899 --> 00:07:52.075
<i>My very, very long...</i>

110
00:07:54.003 --> 00:07:55.462
<i>first love.</i>

111
00:08:07.557 --> 00:08:10.841
I no longer feel that I can be
a useful contributor

112
00:08:10.841 --> 00:08:13.461
to the goals and missions
of the organization.

113
00:08:13.461 --> 00:08:17.238
Oh, and the phrase,
"no longer feel to" over here

114
00:08:17.238 --> 00:08:20.534
means that they don't
feel a certain way anymore.

115
00:08:20.534 --> 00:08:21.635
Remember that part.

116
00:08:21.635 --> 00:08:23.491
Memorize everything
that we covered today.

117
00:08:23.491 --> 00:08:25.738
We'll have a test on it
during the next class.

118
00:08:25.738 --> 00:08:26.997
What the...

119
00:08:26.997 --> 00:08:29.407
- Which bastard is it today?
- Goodbye, Teacher.

120
00:08:38.064 --> 00:08:39.533
A blind date?
A marriage meeting?

121
00:08:39.533 --> 00:08:41.134
Or are you just using them?

122
00:08:41.134 --> 00:08:42.592
Which one is it today?

123
00:08:42.592 --> 00:08:44.076
What are you talking about?

124
00:08:44.076 --> 00:08:45.860
That hairpin.

125
00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:48.472
Who are you meeting up with
that you have it on today?

126
00:08:48.929 --> 00:08:51.857
A man, who else?

127
00:08:51.857 --> 00:08:53.388
You told me to put it on
whenever I'm meeting up with a man.

128
00:08:53.388 --> 00:08:54.656
Yeah, so...

129
00:08:55.379 --> 00:08:56.441
Who's the man?

130
00:08:59.158 --> 00:09:00.754
A nice, new Benz.

131
00:09:02.719 --> 00:09:04.522
What do you mean, "a Benz..."

132
00:09:10.711 --> 00:09:12.300
Want to go somewhere to eat?

133
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.387
There's something I want to eat

134
00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:16.853
but apparently, they will only
serve two servings or more.

135
00:09:17.357 --> 00:09:19.555
- Ms. Baek.
- I'm going to drink alcohol, too.

136
00:09:19.555 --> 00:09:21.682
Do you want to take off that pin
before we go, then?

137
00:09:21.682 --> 00:09:23.294
You can bite down
on some other things instead.

138
00:09:23.294 --> 00:09:24.920
- Ugh!
- Ow!

139
00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.166
Hurry up and get in!

140
00:09:37.414 --> 00:09:39.074
What are you doing?

141
00:09:39.074 --> 00:09:41.325
I really didn't take you for that
kind of person, Mr. Kang

142
00:09:41.325 --> 00:09:43.122
but you really are petty.

143
00:09:43.547 --> 00:09:44.556
What do you mean?

144
00:09:44.556 --> 00:09:46.714
You hid them on purpose, didn't you?
The previous questions on the CSAT!

145
00:09:46.714 --> 00:09:48.147
So that I couldn't see!

146
00:09:48.147 --> 00:09:49.398
What are you talking about?

147
00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:52.147
And here, I was planning to memorize
all of the answers for the CSAT

148
00:09:52.147 --> 00:09:53.849
and change how my life ended up.

149
00:09:57.972 --> 00:10:00.589
I'm planning to head back.

150
00:10:02.305 --> 00:10:03.892
To the year 2007.

151
00:10:08.993 --> 00:10:10.921
I was so envious...

152
00:10:11.368 --> 00:10:13.035
of my friends

153
00:10:13.035 --> 00:10:14.839
who could have a drink
with their parents

154
00:10:14.839 --> 00:10:16.860
after they grew up.

155
00:10:17.286 --> 00:10:20.762
Then, who did you learn
drinking etiquette?

156
00:10:26.555 --> 00:10:30.109
Jeez, how many times does your damned
company have staff dinners per week?

157
00:10:30.109 --> 00:10:31.403
Shut it!

158
00:10:32.887 --> 00:10:33.910
Huh?

159
00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:35.300
You got released from
the hospital, I see!

160
00:10:37.844 --> 00:10:40.633
What are you guys
doing right now?

161
00:10:41.117 --> 00:10:42.829
Well, um...

162
00:10:42.829 --> 00:10:46.171
Mr. Kang said that it's best to learn
drinking etiquette from an adult, so...

163
00:10:46.171 --> 00:10:49.531
Hey! What are you
doing to the kid?

164
00:10:50.728 --> 00:10:54.586
Who the hell educates people on drinking
etiquette with beer, of all things?

165
00:10:54.586 --> 00:10:55.816
Isn't there any soju?

166
00:10:56.326 --> 00:10:58.743
I'll teach him properly.

167
00:10:58.743 --> 00:10:59.975
Give me a sec.

168
00:11:01.597 --> 00:11:02.741
Take care of this situation.

169
00:11:03.217 --> 00:11:05.406
It's okay!
It's totally fine.

170
00:11:05.406 --> 00:11:07.405
Oh, there's soju inside!

171
00:11:07.405 --> 00:11:08.536
Yes!

172
00:11:08.536 --> 00:11:11.751
Yes, go inside.
Straight inside.

173
00:11:15.867 --> 00:11:18.724
Now you see who you would've learned
drinking etiquette from, right?

174
00:11:18.724 --> 00:11:20.590
On the day that you turn
twenty years old

175
00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:23.331
you'll feel as if
you'd be better off dead...

176
00:11:24.368 --> 00:11:26.480
because you'll wake up vomiting
from being so hung over.

177
00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.763
It's such a relief to know that
beforehand.

178
00:11:35.415 --> 00:11:36.850
When you go back...

179
00:11:37.843 --> 00:11:39.796
take good care of Big Sis.

180
00:11:40.563 --> 00:11:43.055
You've already mourned over Mom
while you were here...

181
00:11:43.752 --> 00:11:46.432
but for Big Sis, it'll be the
toughest time of her life.

182
00:11:47.003 --> 00:11:48.003
All right.

183
00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.063
Oh.

184
00:11:50.063 --> 00:11:52.960
Is there anything you heard
from Ji Soo?

185
00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.200
I heard her say...

186
00:11:56.084 --> 00:11:57.792
that she likes you.

187
00:11:59.277 --> 00:12:02.728
Ji Soo said that
she likes you!

188
00:12:03.151 --> 00:12:04.151
So...

189
00:12:04.657 --> 00:12:05.917
I'm planning to go back.

190
00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:08.703
Everything ended well.

191
00:12:09.706 --> 00:12:12.040
So I just need to
try my best now.

192
00:12:13.618 --> 00:12:14.903
Yeah.

193
00:12:15.512 --> 00:12:17.031
I'll do my best.

194
00:12:17.544 --> 00:12:19.273
But, you know, Mr. Kang.

195
00:12:20.049 --> 00:12:21.743
Did you know...

196
00:12:22.325 --> 00:12:26.107
that you can even be
jealous of yourself?

197
00:12:26.816 --> 00:12:31.314
Now, I've even found out
that you're me from the future.

198
00:12:31.314 --> 00:12:33.251
But even so...

199
00:12:34.535 --> 00:12:37.071
I was envious of you.

200
00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:42.003
Ji Soo's first love
was you.

201
00:12:43.119 --> 00:12:46.871
And the one that she likes
right now is you, too.

202
00:12:47.643 --> 00:12:50.483
The one that Ji Soo likes
has never been...

203
00:12:51.816 --> 00:12:54.142
me, at this age.

204
00:12:56.539 --> 00:12:58.443
I never go to hear...

205
00:12:59.299 --> 00:13:02.224
Ji Soo say to me...

206
00:13:04.915 --> 00:13:06.633
that she likes me.

207
00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:13.140
But, did you know...

208
00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:16.073
that, in this world...

209
00:13:17.267 --> 00:13:20.714
there will be some things
that you wish you'd never heard?

210
00:13:21.915 --> 00:13:23.604
That...

211
00:13:24.335 --> 00:13:26.521
would have been the less painful
of the two options.

212
00:13:29.766 --> 00:13:33.200
You'll find out what I mean
when you become an adult.

213
00:13:45.988 --> 00:13:49.671
Ugh, go away, already!

214
00:13:49.671 --> 00:13:52.532
I tend to sleep on my left side!

215
00:13:52.532 --> 00:13:56.742
Do you think I'd tend to sleep
on my right side, then?

216
00:14:01.967 --> 00:14:04.166
Ugh, come on!

217
00:14:06.701 --> 00:14:08.701
"Ugh, come on!"

218
00:14:11.728 --> 00:14:12.983
Mr. Kang.

219
00:14:13.498 --> 00:14:14.640
What?

220
00:14:15.243 --> 00:14:16.825
Is college nice?

221
00:14:18.373 --> 00:14:20.103
It's just whatever.

222
00:14:20.862 --> 00:14:23.133
Is it nice when you
become an adult?

223
00:14:23.133 --> 00:14:24.360
No.

224
00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:26.099
Not really.

225
00:14:27.825 --> 00:14:31.210
But still, it's nice to make
your own money, right?

226
00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:33.821
Are you kidding me?

227
00:14:33.821 --> 00:14:37.233
It's the best when someone else
is making money for you.

228
00:14:37.233 --> 00:14:42.642
You have to instill some hope
in me about the future!

229
00:14:42.642 --> 00:14:45.427
Haven't you ever heard of
a "white lie?"

230
00:14:46.025 --> 00:14:48.084
What did you actually
enjoy in your life, then?

231
00:14:52.209 --> 00:14:53.961
Waiting.

232
00:14:57.243 --> 00:14:58.647
I thought that...

233
00:15:00.705 --> 00:15:02.765
today, or maybe the next day...

234
00:15:03.847 --> 00:15:06.180
or maybe the day after that...

235
00:15:07.584 --> 00:15:11.297
I'd run into her,
maybe just once.

236
00:15:11.916 --> 00:15:13.590
And I waited.

237
00:15:15.722 --> 00:15:17.465
For who?

238
00:15:18.443 --> 00:15:20.443
Who do you think?

239
00:15:22.026 --> 00:15:23.496
But now...

240
00:15:24.117 --> 00:15:25.804
I know...

241
00:15:27.205 --> 00:15:28.682
that...

242
00:15:30.094 --> 00:15:33.439
I'll have to wait ten years
to see Ji Soo again.

243
00:15:39.004 --> 00:15:42.829
But still, you can cling to the hope that
you'll see her in ten years.

244
00:15:42.829 --> 00:15:45.305
That'll help you
press onward.

245
00:15:47.002 --> 00:15:49.075
You said that you heard it yourself.

246
00:15:49.772 --> 00:15:51.991
And you told me that
Ji Soo said that likes me.

247
00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:53.647
So now...

248
00:15:53.647 --> 00:15:55.959
wouldn't the future
that's in store for both of us

249
00:15:55.959 --> 00:15:58.073
that I don't know about
be a happy ending?

250
00:16:02.651 --> 00:16:05.489
That's a pretty hopeful future you've got
waiting for you, don't you think?

251
00:16:17.454 --> 00:16:18.717
Mr. Kang.

252
00:16:19.617 --> 00:16:21.037
I...

253
00:16:22.151 --> 00:16:24.940
was so happy to have
met you.

254
00:16:25.878 --> 00:16:29.554
Because I found out that I grew up
to become quite a decent adult.

255
00:16:58.825 --> 00:17:00.440
I'm sorry...

256
00:17:00.921 --> 00:17:04.232
that I keep lying to you.

257
00:17:05.409 --> 00:17:09.003
But the reason why
I keep lying to you...

258
00:17:10.334 --> 00:17:13.834
is because I want to leave it for you
to deal with when you're an adult...

259
00:17:15.218 --> 00:17:17.591
when you're ready to handle.

260
00:17:18.994 --> 00:17:20.884
And let's not...

261
00:17:22.367 --> 00:17:24.420
get angry...

262
00:17:24.972 --> 00:17:28.737
or resent that thing
called fate.

263
00:17:30.273 --> 00:17:31.902
<i>After all...</i>

264
00:17:32.911 --> 00:17:34.933
<i>we did get to smile a lot...</i>

265
00:17:35.676 --> 00:17:37.802
<i>and had our hearts
skip a beat a lot...</i>

266
00:17:38.809 --> 00:17:40.967
<i>and got to be quite happy.</i>

267
00:17:43.707 --> 00:17:45.748
That's more than good enough.

268
00:17:46.892 --> 00:17:48.260
Right?

269
00:18:00.361 --> 00:18:02.176
You've worked so hard.

270
00:18:03.547 --> 00:18:05.617
Good job, Kang Shin Woo.

271
00:18:08.733 --> 00:18:09.819
<i>[Orthopedic Surgeon: Shin Joo Hwan]</i>

272
00:18:09.819 --> 00:18:11.097
Han Ji Soo.

273
00:18:11.603 --> 00:18:13.331
Remember that promise you made me?

274
00:18:13.331 --> 00:18:14.441
I want to use it today.

275
00:18:14.441 --> 00:18:16.046
I get to have you today.

276
00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:21.482
Yeah, the time will be...

277
00:18:23.232 --> 00:18:24.531
What's your problem?

278
00:18:24.531 --> 00:18:25.789
<i>[No talking on the phone
during appointments]</i>

279
00:18:25.789 --> 00:18:27.798
I'm a patient whose appointment is now.

280
00:18:27.798 --> 00:18:29.060
Didn't you get discharged?

281
00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:30.847
I'm here for my treatment.

282
00:18:36.389 --> 00:18:37.676
Damn.

283
00:18:40.232 --> 00:18:41.442
There we go.

284
00:18:41.442 --> 00:18:42.903

<i>Meet me at the front door

286
00:18:50.526 --> 00:18:51.884
Doctor.

287
00:18:51.884 --> 00:18:53.578
I'm leaving today.

288
00:18:53.578 --> 00:18:55.043
Leaving?

289
00:18:55.043 --> 00:18:56.448
So...

290
00:18:57.059 --> 00:18:59.103
Hang out with me,
just for today.

291
00:19:01.803 --> 00:19:03.591
Yes, this is the hospital, correct?

292
00:19:03.591 --> 00:19:07.147
Please connect me to Doctor Shin Joo
Hwan in the Orthopedics Department.

293
00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:11.053
Whoa!

294
00:19:15.166 --> 00:19:16.512
Let's go.

295
00:20:25.226 --> 00:20:28.435
Oh, coming to places like this
reminds me of the past.

296
00:20:28.953 --> 00:20:30.034
Me too.

297
00:20:30.502 --> 00:20:31.633
Hey.

298
00:20:31.633 --> 00:20:34.052
There's a huge generational
gap between us.

299
00:20:34.694 --> 00:20:37.198
You grew up watching
Pororo, right?

300
00:20:37.198 --> 00:20:40.145
Back in our days,
we watched "Young Shim" and "Ha Ni."

301
00:20:40.145 --> 00:20:41.643
"Run, Ha Ni!"

302
00:20:42.291 --> 00:20:44.113
Do you even know those shows?

303
00:20:44.113 --> 00:20:45.548
Of course I do.

304
00:20:45.548 --> 00:20:48.156
I watched those shows a lot
back in kindergarten.

305
00:20:48.636 --> 00:20:49.647
Huh?

306
00:20:49.647 --> 00:20:51.598
They still aired that show
when you were young?

307
00:20:51.598 --> 00:20:52.640
Of course.

308
00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:53.831
I even remember the times
that they aired.

309
00:20:53.831 --> 00:20:56.360
Sundays and Mondays, at 1 o' clock!
Right after "National Singing Contest."

310
00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:57.698
Yeah, that's right!

311
00:20:57.698 --> 00:21:00.386
I watched a lot of other
cartoons too, besides "Ha Ni."

312
00:21:00.386 --> 00:21:03.665
"Fly, Superboard," "Pokemon,"
"Duchi and Puku."

313
00:21:03.665 --> 00:21:05.496
Yeah, that's right.

314
00:21:06.213 --> 00:21:09.721
But, why doesn't it feel like
you're like the other kids your age?

315
00:21:09.721 --> 00:21:12.369
It almost feels as if I'm talking
to my friends right now.

316
00:21:12.369 --> 00:21:15.989
I have no idea who's who
when I watch TV nowadays.

317
00:21:16.565 --> 00:21:18.651
Back in our day, the top
idol group was

318
00:21:18.651 --> 00:21:20.136
- Girls' Generation.
- Girls' Generation.

319
00:21:24.087 --> 00:21:26.874
But, isn't there anything
that you want?

320
00:21:26.874 --> 00:21:29.469
I want to buy you something since
you're going far away.

321
00:21:29.469 --> 00:21:30.640
Then...

322
00:21:31.426 --> 00:21:33.270
give me that.

323
00:21:34.781 --> 00:21:35.808
This?

324
00:21:35.808 --> 00:21:38.003
Yes, as my birthday present.

325
00:21:38.003 --> 00:21:39.526
Oh, it's your birthday?

326
00:21:39.526 --> 00:21:41.607
No, my birthday has already passed.

327
00:21:42.228 --> 00:21:44.215
But I still want this from you
as a birthday gift.

328
00:21:44.215 --> 00:21:47.992
All right then, I'll give you your
present for next year early.

329
00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:49.869
Happy birthday.

330
00:21:53.248 --> 00:21:54.745
Now...

331
00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:57.434
all of my wishes
have come true.

332
00:21:59.053 --> 00:22:00.680
And finally...

333
00:22:01.579 --> 00:22:04.667
there's a place that
I want to go to, with you.

334
00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:09.489
I really wanted to...

335
00:22:10.072 --> 00:22:12.203
say my final farewell
to you here.

336
00:22:19.743 --> 00:22:21.609
I once had a friend.

337
00:22:22.413 --> 00:22:24.706
But I didn't even know that
would be the last time I'd see her...

338
00:22:26.249 --> 00:22:28.117
and I didn't even get to say
what I wanted to say to her.

339
00:22:28.117 --> 00:22:30.205
And we parted ways here.

340
00:22:32.595 --> 00:22:34.088
What did you want to say to her?

341
00:22:39.009 --> 00:22:40.578
"I like you."

342
00:22:42.165 --> 00:22:43.637
"I..."

343
00:22:44.636 --> 00:22:47.463
"really like you, quite a bit."

344
00:22:52.144 --> 00:22:53.632
That friend...

345
00:22:54.396 --> 00:22:56.501
was my first love.

346
00:22:58.714 --> 00:23:00.954
I was happy that...

347
00:23:03.024 --> 00:23:05.532
I was able to meet that friend...

348
00:23:07.603 --> 00:23:09.223
and was able to
fall for her.

349
00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:11.484
Quite a bit.

350
00:23:13.657 --> 00:23:15.547
It was the same for me.

351
00:23:16.354 --> 00:23:17.896
Because...

352
00:23:18.932 --> 00:23:20.866
I also had a first love.

353
00:23:21.984 --> 00:23:23.934
By your first love

354
00:23:23.934 --> 00:23:26.192
do you mean your homeroom
teacher from high school?

355
00:23:26.779 --> 00:23:29.697
You said that last time
to your friends.

356
00:23:30.286 --> 00:23:31.581
No.

357
00:23:32.408 --> 00:23:34.664
The person whom I liked...

358
00:23:34.664 --> 00:23:36.665
was my friend.

359
00:23:38.032 --> 00:23:39.811
Kang Shin Woo.

360
00:23:40.925 --> 00:23:42.202
That was...

361
00:23:42.202 --> 00:23:44.182
his name.

362
00:23:45.508 --> 00:23:47.730
I liked that friend of mine...

363
00:23:48.363 --> 00:23:50.111
quite a lot.

365
00:24:07.685 --> 00:24:09.140
Thank you for everything up until now...

366
00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:10.649
Doctor.

367
00:24:11.223 --> 00:24:13.143
I'm thankful too.

368
00:24:14.096 --> 00:24:15.637
Whenever I was with you...

369
00:24:15.637 --> 00:24:19.031
I felt as if I'd gone back to the past.

370
00:24:19.031 --> 00:24:22.540
It felt like I could be happy again.

371
00:24:24.062 --> 00:24:25.893
Just like I was back then.

372
00:24:36.703 --> 00:24:38.214
Here.

373
00:24:38.214 --> 00:24:40.425
This is a farewell gift.

374
00:24:42.072 --> 00:24:44.481
I heard that it's raining this evening.

375
00:24:44.481 --> 00:24:48.155
A long time ago, when
I part ways with that friend...

376
00:24:48.155 --> 00:24:49.739
it was raining.

377
00:24:50.904 --> 00:24:53.582
So, for the past ten years...

378
00:24:54.117 --> 00:24:56.326
in my memory,
that friend of mine...

379
00:24:56.948 --> 00:24:59.562
<i>was always being rained on.</i>

380
00:25:01.007 --> 00:25:03.319
And that pained me so much.

381
00:25:05.598 --> 00:25:07.598
Be healthy...

382
00:25:08.264 --> 00:25:09.716
and take care.

383
00:25:10.201 --> 00:25:11.818
You too, Doctor.

384
00:25:14.446 --> 00:25:16.869
I must have grown attached to you
in this short amount of time.

385
00:25:16.869 --> 00:25:18.242
Doctor.

386
00:25:19.607 --> 00:25:21.007
I...

387
00:25:22.044 --> 00:25:25.305
would like it if you
weren't in pain anymore.

388
00:25:27.134 --> 00:25:28.398
So....

389
00:25:30.148 --> 00:25:31.615
as soon as you leave
from this place...

390
00:25:32.154 --> 00:25:33.709
turn your phone on
right away.

391
00:25:45.398 --> 00:25:48.158
You want me to make it so that
Ji Soo can leave Garam Island?

392
00:25:48.158 --> 00:25:50.271
You have the power to do that.

393
00:25:50.271 --> 00:25:51.945
You can get her back to Seoul

394
00:25:51.945 --> 00:25:53.919
or wherever else
that isn't here.

395
00:25:53.919 --> 00:25:55.856
I just don't get it.

396
00:25:56.397 --> 00:25:58.338
Didn't you like Ji Soo?

397
00:25:58.338 --> 00:26:00.996
And yet, here you are, asking
another man who likes this woman

398
00:26:00.996 --> 00:26:04.329
to help her leave,
when you like her.

399
00:26:05.808 --> 00:26:07.703
To put it in your terms

400
00:26:07.703 --> 00:26:09.221
I don't think you're
"following the rules."

401
00:26:09.221 --> 00:26:10.339
No.

402
00:26:10.339 --> 00:26:12.959
This is the final rule
that is left to me now.

403
00:26:12.959 --> 00:26:15.495
To make sure that Ji Soo leaves
here, no matter what it takes...

404
00:26:16.312 --> 00:26:18.296
and make it so that she won't
have to see me anymore.

405
00:26:18.296 --> 00:26:19.694
And what...

406
00:26:20.547 --> 00:26:21.723
is the reason for this?

407
00:26:21.723 --> 00:26:23.829
Because Ji Soo will feel
more and more unhappy...

408
00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:27.211
the more she sees me.

409
00:26:32.471 --> 00:26:34.000
But before that

410
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.636
I must know what happened
between you and Ji Soo.

411
00:26:39.262 --> 00:26:40.592
But...

412
00:26:41.099 --> 00:26:42.877
did you and Deok Goo
plan this, by any chance?

413
00:26:43.346 --> 00:26:44.450
Deok Goo?

414
00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:46.982
Why is it that both of you came
to see me, and said the same things?

415
00:26:54.803 --> 00:26:56.069
Doctor.

416
00:26:56.501 --> 00:26:57.598
Yeah?

417
00:26:57.598 --> 00:26:59.271
I have a favor to ask of you.

418
00:26:59.271 --> 00:27:03.415
Isn't it too much of a waste to keep
Doctor Han Ji Soo in the countryside?

419
00:27:04.053 --> 00:27:07.521
I feel like Seoul suits her better.

420
00:27:08.044 --> 00:27:09.597
Please make that happen.

421
00:27:09.597 --> 00:27:12.209
If you do that...

422
00:27:12.886 --> 00:27:14.979
then I'll give up my place
as first in line to you.

<i>Don't you ever forgive me.</i>

Hate me and resent me...

429
00:28:10.818 --> 00:28:13.405
and when you get tired
of hating me

430
00:28:13.405 --> 00:28:16.540
just forget about everything.

Ugh!

We lived together for only
a couple of days

448

I thought you fixed that
bad habit when you grew up

00:30:35.976 --> 00:30:37.880
How much older do you need to get
to stop doing this, already?

This wasn't me!

457
00:30:39.331 --> 00:30:42.469
Only you and I live here, so
who else would've done it?

458
00:30:43.229 --> 00:30:45.184
There was one other person here!

Oh, as if!

You're trying to blame him, when
his life is pitiful enough?

How could there be another kid with

Aren't you even worried?

Why don't you worry about the brother

00:32:26.552 --> 00:32:30.023
Oh, I made a three-pointer
with a basketball, and...

488
00:32:30.473 --> 00:32:32.018
Wait, no.
Was it the bus?

489
00:32:32.018 --> 00:32:34.056
- Oh, come on!
- What the...

490
00:32:34.056 --> 00:32:35.190
Did you go out with her?

491
00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:36.328
Did you confess?

492
00:32:36.328 --> 00:32:37.861
Oh, as for my confession...

493
00:32:37.861 --> 00:32:40.823
when I met her for the first time
in 10 years, in Seoul...

494
00:32:40.823 --> 00:32:44.244
No, ten years ago,
at Firefly Bridge...

495
00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:50.059
Wait, no.
That wasn't ten years ago.

496
00:32:50.059 --> 00:32:53.017
- Huh?
- What's with him?

497
00:32:57.221 --> 00:32:58.581
Hey, there.

498
00:33:01.366 --> 00:33:03.905
<i>[My Honey]</i>

499
00:33:04.432 --> 00:33:06.028
So you are dating, Na Hee.

500
00:33:06.028 --> 00:33:08.088
Oh my gosh!
N-no, I'm not!

501
00:33:08.088 --> 00:33:09.320
Oh, as if.

502
00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:10.690
Who is that?

503
00:33:10.690 --> 00:33:12.419
Is that the man that you went
on a blind date with, last time?

504
00:33:12.419 --> 00:33:14.240
That's a definite no!

505
00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:16.687
I won't look, so chat away
to your heart's content!

506
00:33:19.723 --> 00:33:21.933
What about you?
Have you been seeing someone lately?

507
00:33:21.933 --> 00:33:25.110
You're always on your phone these days.

508
00:33:28.125 --> 00:33:30.091
<i>After he went back</i>

509
00:33:30.091 --> 00:33:33.937
<i>I started getting letters
from the past.</i>

510
00:33:33.937 --> 00:33:35.421
Hey there.

511
00:33:35.986 --> 00:33:37.837
Hi.

512
00:33:37.837 --> 00:33:39.292
<i>Mr. Kang.</i>

513
00:33:39.292 --> 00:33:41.597
<i>You were waiting for my
email again, weren't you?</i>

514
00:33:43.014 --> 00:33:46.643
<i>Because I'm probably the
only one who contacts you.</i>

515
00:33:46.643 --> 00:33:49.251
<i>Look at him, acting like the
same doesn't apply to him.</i>

516
00:33:51.831 --> 00:33:53.403
<i>[2007]</i>

517
00:33:53.403 --> 00:33:54.911
That's right.

518
00:33:54.911 --> 00:33:57.290
Who am I kidding?

519
00:33:57.915 --> 00:34:00.265
I'm the same as you
in that regard.

520
00:34:07.194 --> 00:34:08.640
Damn it.

521
00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:11.655
I shouldn't have gotten it fixed
after it got water damaged.

522
00:34:13.548 --> 00:34:15.394
Huh?
What is this?

523
00:34:15.394 --> 00:34:16.428
<i>[Voice Mail]</i>

524
00:34:16.428 --> 00:34:17.720
When did I get this?

525
00:34:20.696 --> 00:34:23.149
Do they send spam through
voice mails now, too?

526
00:34:29.156 --> 00:34:32.412
<i>At any rate, I'm only sending this
because I feel bad for the 28-year-old me</i>

527
00:34:32.412 --> 00:34:36.863
<i>who'll be all by his lonesome
in the chilly autumn weather.</i>

528
00:34:37.303 --> 00:34:38.475
<i>Oh yeah.</i>

529
00:34:38.475 --> 00:34:41.258
<i>I almost forgot to tell you since
things have been so hectic, but...</i>

530
00:34:51.937 --> 00:34:54.629
<i>I think that there is
something going on</i>

531
00:34:54.629 --> 00:34:56.850
<i>between Geun Deok
and Na Hee.</i>

532
00:34:58.359 --> 00:35:00.609
<i>Or, as you'd say
in 2017 lingo...</i>

533
00:35:00.609 --> 00:35:04.450
<i>they're "flirting up a storm."</i>

534
00:35:05.283 --> 00:35:08.812
<i>On the day that all of our friends
met up together in 2017</i>

535
00:35:08.812 --> 00:35:11.086
<i>I saw the two of them on
my way back to the hospital.</i>

536
00:35:24.173 --> 00:35:25.461
Yeah.

537
00:35:26.035 --> 00:35:27.285
That's right.

538
00:35:27.285 --> 00:35:29.180
Of course I miss you, too.

539
00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:30.318
I love you!

540
00:35:32.517 --> 00:35:35.767
Then, the guy she was talking to
before was Choo Geun Deok?

541
00:35:36.992 --> 00:35:39.356
Oh gosh, I saw something
that I shouldn't have seen!

542
00:35:39.356 --> 00:35:41.780
Ugh, I'm getting goosebumps!

543
00:35:42.234 --> 00:35:43.798
Where are you going?

544
00:35:43.798 --> 00:35:46.336
What are you doing?
Just focus on studying.

545
00:35:46.336 --> 00:35:47.921
Come on, where are you going?

546
00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:52.124
Ugh, I'm getting goosebumps.

547
00:35:53.131 --> 00:35:55.463
Oh gosh, I saw something
that I shouldn't have seen!

548
00:35:59.479 --> 00:36:00.883
<i>Mr. Kang.</i>

549
00:36:00.883 --> 00:36:03.062
<i>You know everything now, right?</i>

550
00:36:03.524 --> 00:36:07.048
<i>About how I lied and pretended
not to know about Ji Soo.</i>

551
00:36:07.812 --> 00:36:09.359
<i>But let's just agree...</i>

552
00:36:09.908 --> 00:36:11.883
<i>to let that one slide.</i>

553
00:36:12.339 --> 00:36:14.461
<i>After all, you lied too.</i>

554
00:36:14.461 --> 00:36:16.729
You really were great at lying.

555
00:36:16.729 --> 00:36:19.220
You were really great at lying, Mr. Kang.

556
00:36:20.339 --> 00:36:21.531
Number two.

557
00:36:21.531 --> 00:36:23.627
<i>- So...</i>
- X minus one...

558
00:36:23.627 --> 00:36:26.508
<i>how are you doing now,
Mr. Kang?</i>

559
00:36:27.218 --> 00:36:30.053
<i>I won't fall for your lies anymore.</i>

560
00:36:30.939 --> 00:36:32.314
<i>Because...</i>

561
00:36:32.921 --> 00:36:34.738
<i>right now, I...</i>

562
00:36:36.466 --> 00:36:38.394
<i>am not okay.</i>

563
00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:41.972
<i>So...</i>

564
00:36:43.011 --> 00:36:45.437
<i>there's no way that
you'd be okay.</i>

565
00:36:47.595 --> 00:36:51.022
<i>[I told you that I'd tell you my name.
It's Kang Shin Woo.]</i>

566
00:36:56.131 --> 00:36:58.283
Here's what you asked for, Doctor.

567
00:36:59.298 --> 00:37:02.466
The only personal information we have on
this patient is about his guardian.

568
00:37:02.466 --> 00:37:05.651
You could contact his guardian if you
need anything, couldn't you?

569
00:37:05.651 --> 00:37:07.267
It's fine.

570
00:37:07.267 --> 00:37:11.176
I just had a suspicion about something,
but it would just make no sense.

571
00:37:11.176 --> 00:37:12.687
But, Doctor.

572
00:37:12.687 --> 00:37:14.847
I'm so sad that we couldn't have a
proper farewell party for you.

573
00:37:14.847 --> 00:37:16.392
Today's your last day here, isn't it?

574
00:37:16.392 --> 00:37:17.396
Yes.

575
00:37:17.396 --> 00:37:19.396
Today's my last day.

576
00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:24.191
The plane is taking off
tomorrow afternoon

577
00:37:24.191 --> 00:37:26.075
so let's leave early tomorrow morning.

578
00:37:26.901 --> 00:37:30.285
I'd want to have the airplane come
here and pick us up, if I could

579
00:37:30.285 --> 00:37:32.397
but that's not quite within
my level of authority.

580
00:37:34.557 --> 00:37:36.952
If you just endure the
boat ride tomorrow

581
00:37:36.952 --> 00:37:39.185
I'll make it so that you'll only ever
take planes for the rest of your life.

582
00:37:39.185 --> 00:37:40.865
It's too bad, though

583
00:37:40.865 --> 00:37:44.426
since I don't know if I'll be
needing to take a plane ever again.

584
00:37:45.117 --> 00:37:48.624
I'm heading to the U.S. now
because of the training program

585
00:37:48.624 --> 00:37:51.722
but I'm thinking about staying there,
since I'm making the trip over anyway

586
00:37:51.722 --> 00:37:53.731
since my parents are
both over there, too.

587
00:37:53.731 --> 00:37:55.615
Then I'll come and settle down
there with you.

588
00:37:55.615 --> 00:37:57.992
Can't you be serious for once, Senior?

589
00:37:57.992 --> 00:38:00.540
Last time, when I saw your text
and came to meet you

590
00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:03.017
I was so surprised since you asked me to
come to the U.S. with you out of nowhere.

591
00:38:03.017 --> 00:38:05.062
I told you, my father
told me to go.

592
00:38:05.062 --> 00:38:08.347
He said it'd be best for me to go far
away, where he won't be able to see me

593
00:38:08.347 --> 00:38:09.555
since he can't stand me.

594
00:38:09.555 --> 00:38:12.731
How will you get used to living there,
when all you eat is Korean food?

595
00:38:12.731 --> 00:38:15.385
It's not important what I eat,
whether it may be bread or rice.

596
00:38:16.026 --> 00:38:18.035
What's important is that
I'll be eating with you.

597
00:38:25.511 --> 00:38:27.008
I'm sorry.

598
00:38:29.365 --> 00:38:34.093
<i>If I'd known sooner, I never
would have brought you here.</i>

599
00:38:35.968 --> 00:38:40.169
I'm sorry I can't hang out with you
when today is your last day in Korea.

600
00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:43.405
I have to go say farewell
to a lot of people.

601
00:38:43.405 --> 00:38:46.417
I have a place that I need to visit, too.

602
00:38:49.216 --> 00:38:52.323
It'll go well with your skin tone.

603
00:38:53.097 --> 00:38:54.926
Welcome!

604
00:38:56.234 --> 00:38:57.544
So Ra!

605
00:38:57.544 --> 00:38:59.725
Oh, Ji Soo!

606
00:39:02.629 --> 00:39:04.118
Here we go.

607
00:39:05.615 --> 00:39:07.211
Are you enjoying your job?

608
00:39:07.211 --> 00:39:09.316
It's not ever easy working
for someone else.

609
00:39:09.316 --> 00:39:10.564
It's just whatever.

610
00:39:10.564 --> 00:39:11.691
But still.

611
00:39:11.691 --> 00:39:12.926
You seem a lot happier.

612
00:39:13.205 --> 00:39:16.249
I guess the working mom life suited me
more than being a housewife.

613
00:39:16.249 --> 00:39:18.247
But, what brings you here?

614
00:39:19.944 --> 00:39:22.392
I'm leaving tomorrow, So Ra.

615
00:39:22.821 --> 00:39:25.720
This time, I wanted to tell you
properly before I left.

616
00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:27.019
To where?

617
00:39:27.019 --> 00:39:28.492
Are you going back to Seoul?

618
00:39:28.492 --> 00:39:30.104
I'm going to the U.S.

619
00:39:30.711 --> 00:39:32.218
And this time...

620
00:39:32.747 --> 00:39:34.443
I don't think I'll be coming back.

621
00:39:34.443 --> 00:39:37.118
Does Shin Woo know, too?

622
00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:42.533
But I think that...

623
00:39:43.001 --> 00:39:45.925
Shin Woo will be relieved
that I chose to do this.

624
00:39:49.267 --> 00:39:52.501
<i>If you ever bring up Han Ji Soo
in front of me, I'll kill you!</i>

625
00:39:52.501 --> 00:39:53.575
You got that?

626
00:39:53.575 --> 00:39:55.343
You all better remember that.

627
00:39:55.343 --> 00:39:58.714
I don't want to hear about
a wench like her

628
00:39:58.714 --> 00:40:00.680
so don't even say the "Han"
part of "Han Ji Soo!"

629
00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:02.557
But still, she must have
had her reasons.

630
00:40:02.557 --> 00:40:03.798
What reason?

631
00:40:03.798 --> 00:40:08.213
What reason could she have for leaving
without even a call, or showing her face?

632
00:40:08.213 --> 00:40:10.877
Could you do that to us,
if you were in her shoes?

633
00:40:10.877 --> 00:40:12.035
That's a valid point.

634
00:40:12.035 --> 00:40:16.164
Forget about us. I'm sure she knew
that Shin Woo's mother passed away, too.

635
00:40:16.164 --> 00:40:17.511
Exactly!

636
00:40:18.084 --> 00:40:20.301
How could she do that
to Shin Woo, too?

637
00:40:20.301 --> 00:40:22.622
And after all that Shin Woo
did for her, too!

638
00:40:26.169 --> 00:40:29.347
Ji Soo actually did contact me.

639
00:40:29.347 --> 00:40:32.164
There was a note inside of
the book you gave me, Min Seok.

640
00:40:32.164 --> 00:40:33.301
She wanted to meet up.

641
00:40:33.301 --> 00:40:34.537
So?

642
00:40:34.537 --> 00:40:36.017
Did you meet with her?

643
00:40:36.017 --> 00:40:37.368
No.

644
00:40:37.368 --> 00:40:38.542
Why not?

645
00:40:38.542 --> 00:40:40.493
I knew what she would say, anyway.

646
00:40:40.999 --> 00:40:42.778
So there was no need for her
to relive such a miserable experience.

647
00:40:42.778 --> 00:40:44.251
What do you mean?

648
00:40:44.251 --> 00:40:46.868
What was Ji Soo
going to say?

649
00:40:46.868 --> 00:40:48.095
Just...

650
00:40:48.669 --> 00:40:50.618
a confession that
I didn't need to hear.

651
00:40:51.131 --> 00:40:52.874
A confession that
she didn't need to make.

652
00:40:52.874 --> 00:40:54.370
Just something like that.

653
00:40:55.397 --> 00:40:56.993
It would have just been painful...

654
00:40:57.620 --> 00:40:59.714
for both of us.

655
00:41:03.847 --> 00:41:05.278
So...

656
00:41:05.834 --> 00:41:08.301
don't be too hard on
Ji Soo, you guys.

657
00:41:08.301 --> 00:41:09.588
Just...

658
00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:13.213
think things like...

659
00:41:13.839 --> 00:41:15.946
"she must have had a
good reason..."

660
00:41:17.171 --> 00:41:19.627
and "I hope she's doing well," okay?

661
00:41:24.745 --> 00:41:26.455
Ugh, how frustrating!

662
00:41:28.225 --> 00:41:30.444
What? What?
What is it this time?

663
00:41:30.444 --> 00:41:33.026
I threw away the food waste,
and cleaned the bathroom!

664
00:41:33.026 --> 00:41:35.156
And the kids are eating
at my mom's place.

665
00:41:35.156 --> 00:41:36.732
I didn't say anything.

666
00:41:36.732 --> 00:41:38.144
What is it, then?

667
00:41:38.144 --> 00:41:39.488
Want me to give you a massage?

668
00:41:39.488 --> 00:41:42.477
I told you to use your hands
for drawing, not for massaging!

669
00:41:42.477 --> 00:41:45.256
Ugh, I can't stand it anymore.
I have to tell him.

670
00:41:45.256 --> 00:41:47.861
Despite what may have
happened between those two

671
00:41:47.861 --> 00:41:50.149
I can't just sit here and do nothing.

672
00:41:50.149 --> 00:41:51.149
Ugh!

673
00:41:57.091 --> 00:41:58.555
Yeah, So Ra?

674
00:42:00.635 --> 00:42:01.986
Tomorrow?

675
00:42:04.173 --> 00:42:05.832
<i>Mr. Kang.</i>

676
00:42:05.832 --> 00:42:07.160
<i>The fact that...</i>

677
00:42:07.651 --> 00:42:10.142
<i>I didn't go to meet
Ji Soo on that day...</i>

678
00:42:10.142 --> 00:42:12.042
<i>was the right decision to make, right?</i>

679
00:42:13.604 --> 00:42:15.792
<i>But, to be honest...</i>

680
00:42:16.776 --> 00:42:19.095
<i>I wanted to see her one more time...</i>

681
00:42:20.325 --> 00:42:21.874
<i>if only even like that.</i>

682
00:42:23.562 --> 00:42:24.903
I know.

683
00:42:25.897 --> 00:42:28.218
Because I feel the same way right now.

684
00:42:29.066 --> 00:42:30.426
<i>Mr. Kang.</i>

685
00:42:31.037 --> 00:42:32.318
<i>If...</i>

686
00:42:32.874 --> 00:42:34.707
<i>If I hadn't met Ji Soo on the bus</i>

687
00:42:34.707 --> 00:42:37.363
<i>on the day that she'd
transferred to our school...</i>

688
00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:40.444
<i>do you think that I wouldn't
have ended up liking her?</i>

689
00:42:41.013 --> 00:42:42.557
Even if you hadn't...

690
00:42:43.691 --> 00:42:45.877
I'm sure that you would have...

691
00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:49.294
ended up falling for her
at another time instead.

692
00:42:51.265 --> 00:42:52.910
Because I went through
that same thing.

693
00:42:53.765 --> 00:42:55.452
<i>Then...</i>

694
00:42:55.452 --> 00:42:58.287
<i>is fate something that
we can't do anything about...</i>

695
00:42:58.852 --> 00:43:01.499
<i>no matter how many times...</i>

696
00:43:02.425 --> 00:43:04.638
<i>we relive the same experiences?</i>

697
00:43:05.622 --> 00:43:07.225
<i>If that's the case...</i>

698
00:43:07.805 --> 00:43:10.136
<i>even if we turn back time again...</i>

699
00:43:10.703 --> 00:43:12.602
<i>we'd probably end up
like this again.</i>

700
00:43:13.328 --> 00:43:15.734
<i>Ji Soo will feel miserable
when she looks at us.</i>

701
00:43:15.734 --> 00:43:19.086
<i>And we will feel pain again because
we will have to let Ji Soo go.</i>

702
00:43:20.289 --> 00:43:21.606
<i>This is probably our fate...</i>

703
00:43:22.312 --> 00:43:25.225
<i>and Ji Soo's fate, right?</i>

704
00:43:27.546 --> 00:43:28.883
<i>Mr. Kang...</i>

705
00:43:29.526 --> 00:43:30.870
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

706
00:43:32.647 --> 00:43:34.254
<i>That's why...</i>

707
00:43:34.752 --> 00:43:36.502
<i>I will change the future.</i>

708
00:43:37.827 --> 00:43:40.131
<i>The things that have
happened to you already</i>

709
00:43:40.131 --> 00:43:41.932
<i>are still in the future for me.</i>

710
00:43:42.539 --> 00:43:43.580
<i>So, I...</i>

711
00:43:44.542 --> 00:43:48.622
<i>will not meet with Ji Soo
10 years in the future, in Seoul.</i>

<i>[Longing Heart]</i>

714
00:44:25.026 --> 00:44:27.934
<i>Shouldn't you really throw
that photo out, now?</i>

715
00:44:27.934 --> 00:44:30.169
<i>I think I'll have to meet with
a certain person, after all.</i>

716
00:44:30.169 --> 00:44:32.153
<i>The fact that you always
treasured that photo so much</i>

717
00:44:32.153 --> 00:44:33.586
<i>was because of that friend, right?</i>

718
00:44:33.586 --> 00:44:36.669
<i>Did you get a call from Mom on the day
she got into the accident, by any chance?</i>

719
00:44:36.669 --> 00:44:38.139
<i>No, I didn't.</i>

720
00:44:38.139 --> 00:44:39.602
<i>I'll believe that.</i>

721
00:44:39.602 --> 00:44:42.148
<i>I've decided to bet
everything on that future.</i>

722
00:44:42.148 --> 00:44:45.265
<i>Because I can't have your present life
or Ji Soo's present life</i>

<i>change because of me.</i>
