00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.400
Hey, don't come close.

3
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.600
Did you catch it?

4
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.300
- How about you? Are you okay? 
 - Yeah.

5
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.400
I think I have some medicine left.

6
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.100
No, no, you got it prescribed under your name. Take it all.

7
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.900
Take it. That was my cold to begin with.

8
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.430
Because of what we did last night...

9
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.100
What you have and I have are all the same...

10
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.700
Let's go.

11
00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.500
Moon Soo... Why is Moon Soo there...

<i>[ Episode 13 ]</i>

13
00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.760
Stop looking.

14
00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.570
I said don't look.

15
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.700
What are you doing?

16
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.700
- Being jealous. 
 - Jealous?

17
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.420
He looks cool even in my eyes.

18
00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.520
In your eyes, I'm sure more so.

19
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.000
Oh, oh... Hey, it's no use looking at him now. You can't take a refund now.

20
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.300
What refund?

21
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.600
What?

22
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.000
You look especially pretty today.

23
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.600
How could a person become prettier every day so shamelessly?

24
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.600
What's wrong with you?

25
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.300
Because I can't believe it.

26
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.400
How could you reject a cool man like CEO Seo and...

27
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.560
come to me?

28
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.800
We all know that the CEO is a good man.

29
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.600
Geez.

30
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.700
But for me, you're a much better person.

31
00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.000
A good man.

32
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.200
- Hey, Gang Doo! 
 - Yes!

33
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.700
The land for the memorial park is close to the front entrance. There are lots of foot traffic.

34
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.400
Since we gave in quite a bit, you'll have to pay a special attention to it.

35
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.200
Yes. I'm in the middle of discussions with the landscape design team.

36
00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.300
You're aware that chances like this don't come around often, right?

37
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.200
Joo Won said he gave you the job trusting your ability. But I don't believe that.

38
00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.400
I'll do a good job without making mistakes.

39
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.600
That goes without saying.

40
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.500
Yes. All right then.

41
00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.700
I'm not done talking.

42
00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.370
I wish you'd keep your manners about dealing with the person who's been rejected.

43
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.400
Pardon?

44
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:10.400
Don't show off your great relationship with Lee Gang Doo in front of CEO Seo.

45
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.400
- That's... 
 - It's just that CEO Seo doesn't show his feelings.

46
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.710
He's struggling a lot because of you, Moon Soo.

47
00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.520
I thought I'd be happy if Joo Won suffered.

48
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.810
But it's harder for me as someone watching him suffer.

49
00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.870
I ask you.

50
00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.240
Unni!

51
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.000
Where's the CEO?

52
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
He went to the headquarters with Director Jeong to attend a meeting.

53
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.800
Seriously... Why today?

54
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.600
He's always at the site, so I packed lunch for him as well.

55
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.400
Wow, I'll eat it.

56
00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:19.140
What?

57
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.900
Are you going to waste it then?

58
00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:27.600
You two must be happy. You work together and dating and all. You must be so happy.

59
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.800
What a waste. There's so much of it.

60
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.900
What else? We have to eat it.

61
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.000
I have to eat it separately. I have a cold.

62
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.400
You have a cold, too? Did he catch it from you? What did you two do?

63
00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.000
Do what?

64
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
A relationship where the virus goes back and forth... It must be so nice.

65
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
What do you do when you go on a date? It's been so long for me that I can't even fathom.

66
00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.000
Have you gone to the movie theater? There are so many good movies out lately.

67
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.400
A theater feels too stuffy.

68
00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.200
Have you been to popular restaurants? Chicken and beer, pizza and beer... stuff like that?

69
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:11.400
Then, how about the ice rink by the subway station? You can fall over on top of each other. It's perfect to make the next move.

70
00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.700
We can't. What if Gang Doo hurts his leg doing that?

71
00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.000
So frustrating... frustrating...

72
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.600
Well, you meet, eat fishcake, take a walk, sit on swings so childishly...

73
00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:26.000
And you walk her home. That's not all, right?

74
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.600
If a theater is too stuffy, go to manga cafe.

75
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.500
Look at this. Isn't it clean? You can even play board games.

76
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.100
You can be alone by yourselves in the upper room.

77
00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.700
If you feel all these things are a hassle and want to take care of things in one place...

78
00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.500
If you make a reservation on the day of, the suite costs as much as a motel room.
<i>[ Shall we go together? ]</i>

79

There are places like that? So interesting.

82
00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.200
So annoying.

83
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:16.300
Thanks to me, Gang Doo oppa and site manager are so happy.

84
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.400
So unfair.

85
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Why?

86
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
I think I know her.

87
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.100
If you think you know her, say hi. Why be so serious?

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:40.260
Why did you both leave me out?

95
00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.000
Try to understand Moon Soo...

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Fine... fine... I'm the one with the problem.

What is she doing there?

98
00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.680
If you're curious, you go there yourself.

99
00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:00.430
How can you say that?

100
00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:05.800
Why should I go there?

101
00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:09.600
I'll never go there!

You and Moon Soo both, how could you...

103
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.200
Let's stop this.

104
00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:17.200
If you say stop, is it something you can stop? Is that how it is with you?

105
00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.800
Let's let go of the person if we're supposed to.

106

Yeon Soo is dead.

I... I can't let her go.

108
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.800
Do you know whose fault that was?

109
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:39.200
Who's the one who wouldn't even let me see Yeon Soo for one last time?

110
00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.400
Who was it, huh? Who?

111
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.800
Do you know how much I regretted that?

112
00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.100
I regret it, too!

113
00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:57.380
My last time seeing Yeon Soo...

114
00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:01.790
You'd regret it even if you saw her.

115
00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:12.100
If you came here to compete as to who has it harder, just go.

116
00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:23.730
It must be so nice to be at peace...

117
00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:30.800
How... how could you be perfectly fine like this?

118
00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.100
In your eyes...

119
00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:39.600
Do I seem perfectly fine living this way?

120
00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:46.800
Look... How could a parent be perfectly fine after losing a child?

121
00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:51.100
Where is such a person who is perfectly fine after going through that?

122
00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:02.200
Hi. Good job, Gang Doo.

123
00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:09.200
Gang Doo. Hey, blood...

124
00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:15.600
Are you the only one working? If this happens, you make it seem like I'm working you hard.

125
00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.800
If I'm working, I should show it off.

126
00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.800

129

Can I take a look at medical records from 2005?

130
00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:06.400
This is a pond. I think we can color it blue on the plan.

131
00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:11.400
Unni. I enjoy working like this with my hands more.

132
00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:16.100
When the design team comes back, I'll have to get back to working on the computer.

133
00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:18.200
Next time, I want to work with you from get-go...

134
00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:22.400
You'd be able to do it alone next time, So Mi.

135
00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:26.600
I'm quitting after this project.

136
00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:27.800
Why?

137
00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:31.200
I was to only work on this project from the beginning.

138
00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:35.800
Then, renew your contract. I'm sure the CEO would do it for you.

139
00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.500
That's why.

140
00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:41.460
That's why I can't work here any longer.

141
00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:47.110
When you finish coloring, get the plan from the lighting team and try posting it yourself, So Mi.

142
00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:49.800
It's a walkway along here. So, leave it blank.

143
00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:54.600
If we're going to build the memorial park at the original parking lot area, we have to request for change of plans.

144
00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:58.400
We have to get a new estimate, too. We'll talk to the vendor...

145
00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:01.000
You take care of all that yourselves.

146
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.500
That's why I'm paying you!

147
00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:09.000
The park will be connected to the neighborhood walkway. If the landscape design is worked on separately...

148
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.200
- The budget... 
 - Keep the quality, but lower the expenses.

149
00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:20.400
That's what's important to me. I don't want to know all the specifics of the process.

150
00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:26.600
And you... Stop playing hard to get and go on a blind date.

151
00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:30.570
Why?

152
00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:36.400
Kim Hwa Min's father is the Vice Minister of Ministry of Land, Transportation, and Tourism. If we can manage them well...

153
00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:39.000
For us to be here...

154
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.300
There's no need for us to be having a discussion without an answer.

155
00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:46.400
Is that something a Cheongyu Construction executive director should say?

156
00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:51.600
That's how I got married. I'm not asking only you to do it.

157
00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:56.500
After wrapping up the accident, I got married within two months.

158
00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:01.200
Father pushed me into it saying my father-in-law will be the chairman of the Architecture Industy Association.

159
00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:04.400
You think I got married because I wanted to?

160
00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:07.300
Do you know how Cheongyu...

161
00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.700
came thus far?

162
00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:15.800
Hey... You're not the only one who sacrificed.

163
00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:20.100
Speak. What do you think about that?

164
00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:29.300
If he's such a person, I guess he'd be a great help to Cheongyu.

165
00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:42.770
We'll begin the construction of the foundation work on the parking lot right away.

166
00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:46.000
- Tomorrow at the site... 
 - How about for me instead of Cheongyu?

167
00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:52.800
Going on a blind date... Do you think it's helpful to me as well?

168
00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.000
That's up to you.

169
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.500
No. Answer me. I'll do whatever you say.

170
00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:02.000
How do you want me to answer?

171
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.800
I told you not to sigh in front of me.

172
00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.800
I can only sigh.

173
00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:11.200
You whining like this... To me, you're full of it.

174
00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:16.700
Let's say your brother married someone he didn't want to. But I lost my father.

175
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.900
Even you whom I trusted the most. You turned your back to me saying you have to work for the company.

176
00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:31.220
How about you? What did you lose?

177
00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:39.370
My answer is the same. He'll be helpful to Cheongyu.

178
00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:47.000
If that's the case, I'm sure you'll marry him even if I told you not to.

179
00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.600
Open. Say ah...

180
00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:32.400
Open wide. Ah...

181
00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.250
That's right.

182
00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:40.400
I learned it from Mama. She said it'll work like magic with one spoonful of this.

183
00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:43.200
Where did you catch such a nasty cold?

184
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.200
What's wrong with you...

185
00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:57.800
What did you decide to do with this place? Mama must've told you what to do.

186
00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:01.000
She said it's the last fortress.

187
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.300
There's something like that.

188
00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:08.500
How did you know about that noodle place?

189
00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:11.800
What else? I went because the noodles are delicious.

190
00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:12.800
Why?

191
00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:16.400
I went there with Director Jeong and something crazy happened.

192
00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.200
We got kicked out.

193
00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.700
Noona!

194
00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:23.600
How can you take that moron there?

195
00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:26.200
That's why I'm asking you!

196
00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:29.000
It's run by Moon Soo's father.

197
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.400
What about it?

198
00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:33.800
He must've recognized Jeong Yoo Taek as someone from Cheongyu.

199
00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:38.600
You should've told me in advance. I wouldn't have taken him there.

200
00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:43.200
By chance, Noona... Do you like that moron?

201
00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.600
I told you he's my client.

202
00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:48.400
You went there with your client to eat some noodles?

203
00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:52.300
Is that... Are you kidding me?

204
00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:58.000
You said you're going to date a single man. Don't you know he has a wife?

205
00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
I know. I know, but...

206
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000
He's so childish and petty... More I see him, I felt sorry for him.

207
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Picking up guys because you feel sorry for him... Make me the last person for you to do that.

208
00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:14.900
Or take care of the cats. There are so many out there.

209
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.100
Don't fall for him. You're too good for him.

210
00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:32.740
In any case... he sure does know how to sweet talk.

211
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.700
You're home.

212
00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:50.200
Let's eat. Auntie brought some cabbage, so I made some bean paste stew.

213
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000
What are you doing? Sit down.

214
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000
I don't feel like eating.

215
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.300
Still eat.

216
00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:05.200
You eat a lot.

217
00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.500
What are you doing over there?

218
00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:32.800
Did you come to eat noodles?

219
00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:35.100
No.

220
00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:36.700
Then?

221
00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:42.100
I was thinking. Why did I come here?

222
00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:47.000
I want to yell at someone...

223
00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:50.600
But I have nowhere to go.

224
00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:52.400
Do you even know what kind of place this is?

225
00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:56.000
I know. It's Ha Moon Soo's father's restaurant.

226
00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.700
Wait.

227
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.200
Have a drink with me.

228
00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:06.900
Why should I?

229
00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:09.400
Just because.

230
00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:13.510
I don't think I should leave you alone.

231
00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:21.500
You're so handsome. So handsome.

232
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.200
Wow. He's more of a hyung than Hyung. A real hyung.

233
00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:32.300
- Wow. Hyungnim! Hyungnim! 
 - Aigoo...

234
00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:35.100
Is he sleeping over? Do you want some blankets?

235
00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:37.180
No, it's okay. Give me one ramen.

236
00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:39.500
One won't be enough.

237
00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:46.500
Wow, you're an awesome hyung. A total hyung.

238
00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:50.300
- I'll pay you back tomorrow. 
 - Take these, too.

239
00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:52.000
Let's go.

240
00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:56.900
Hyung, I'll bring up some kimchi.

241
00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:13.410
My room is too small.

242
00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:26.130
You'll get warm if you eat this. Eating ramen when it's cold is so cool.

243
00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.920
What were you talking about earlier?

244
00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:42.780
Yell at whom?

245
00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:47.400
By chance... Moon Soo?

246
00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:54.300
No way. You don't hate someone you like overnight.

247
00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:57.930
Then who?

248
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.100
Me? Were you waiting for me?

249
00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:10.310
Lee Gang Doo... I envy you. I don't hate you.

250
00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:19.030
Lee Gang Doo, since when did you start liking Ha Moon Soo?

251
00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:22.200
For us to be talking about that...

252
00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:27.200
I was attracted to her from the beginning.

253
00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:31.600
Do you want to live in a place like this? Can you live here with your children?

254
00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:36.000
It'd be nice if we had buildings that were 100, 200 years old.

255
00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:38.370
Right?

256
00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:44.750
The subsurface exploration... You'll begin with reevaluating the report, right?

257
00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:48.560
<i>[ Monthly Planner ]</i>

258
00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:51.940
I met someone with same heart as me first time in a long time.

259
00:24:53.050 --> 00:24:57.970
I was happy. She got me excited.

260
00:24:57.970 --> 00:25:01.000
I didn't think I'd feel that way again.

261
00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:11.140
Tell me, Lee Gang Doo. So that I can understand and give her up.

262
00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:16.610
- Just because. 
 - Just because?

263
00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:19.240
Just because.

264
00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:25.260
I saw her today, but I want to see her again tomorrow.

265
00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:29.530
Doesn't that mean I like her?

266
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.640
I...

267
00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:41.540
only had to survive for the day.

268
00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:45.830
But after meeting Moon Soo...

269
00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:52.100
I'm curious about tomorrow. I'm waiting for it.

270
00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:07.710
Hyung! Hyungnim! Kimchi. Kimchi...

271
00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:40.860
I'll be back.

272
00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:42.410
Okay.

273
00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:07.390
So cold! What do you want to see coming all the way here?

274
00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:10.200
Oh?

275
00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:23.990
So pretty... Why did you want to come here?

276
00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:27.040
You know this doesn't suit you at all, right?

277
00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:29.130
What do you mean it doesn't suit me?

278
00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:33.760
When I was in school, I used to be the chairman of the Bird Research Society.

279
00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:39.390
To take a picture of the hooded crane, I went all over the country every season.

280
00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:41.490
You took photos, too?

281
00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:47.860
Hey, if I didn't get into this industry because of my dad, I would've become a documentary director.

282
00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:53.640
My dream was to make a National Geographic Korean version.

283
00:27:54.870 --> 00:28:00.250
I lived in nature traveling all over the world.

284
00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:06.450
Hey, do you know how loud it is when a tundra swan makes a noise when flying?

285
00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:08.600
If they all fly away together...

286
00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:11.260
Then it's as loud as a helicopter.

287
00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:14.610
And over there... light brown and white. Do you see that?

288
00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:19.220
They come from Russia for 366 km distance roundtrip without taking a break.

289
00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:24.330
They fly to Khabarovsk exactly in two weeks from here. Does that make sense?

290
00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:30.760
I guess you don't realize how fast that is. It's as fast as...

291
00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:34.750
Stop explaining. It's no fun knowing everything.

292
00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:39.850
They'll stay like that and leave again without regrets.

293
00:28:39.850 --> 00:28:42.210
That's all I need to know.

294
00:28:53.450 --> 00:28:55.640
- I'm leaving. 
 - Why are you leaving so early?

295
00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:58.730
What do you mean leaving early? I've been here since early morning.

296
00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:02.300
Hey, hey, wow... your clothes... it's different.

297
00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:04.820
Aren't you going home?

298
00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:09.280
Is there still work left to do?

299
00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:14.030
Aigoo, don't mention it. I thought it would end if we continue to dig and deliver everything.

300
00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:17.090
But there are so many concrete pillars stuck all of the place.

301
00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:20.470
Bam, bam, bam... They're breaking everything up.

302
00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:22.950
My head is still shaking.

303
00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:25.960
I don't think I can hear well either.

304
00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:30.050
Hey! I thought you were going home. Why are you going that way?

305
00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:11.960
What? You said you had to buy something.

306
00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:14.500
Let's go somewhere else.

307
00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:24.130
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Fated Lovers Team @ viki</i>

308
00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:13.980
I'm really fine. I don't need anything.

309
00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:16.660
Yeah. You're fine.

310
00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:21.700
No matter how dense I may be, would I ask you to pick out your own gift?

311
00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:23.050
Then?

312
00:32:23.050 --> 00:32:27.290
Jae Yeong. I want to buy her a gift.

00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:30.090
What would be good?

314
00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:32.500
- A birthday gift? 
 - No.

315
00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:36.240
She's finishing up her internship next month. Congratulating her finishing up.

316
00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:39.260
She's cool. A doctor.

317
00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:43.000
What would be good?

318
00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:48.850
What did you buy her for her birthday? What does she like?

319

What?

321
00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:58.230
The day of the accident was Jae Yeong's birthday.

322
00:32:58.230 --> 00:33:00.740
It's also Father's memorial day.

323
00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:06.540
She's never had a happy birthday ever since turning 13.

324

That's why I want to get her something.

325
00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:16.420
She grew up all alone. I don't know what would be good for her.

326
00:33:23.530 --> 00:33:28.560
She liked things like this when she was little. But not now, right?

I heard a lot about you from the executive director.

I really hate blind dates.

I met the Vice Minister at a Industrial Estate Planning Meeting.

334
00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:18.280
Not to mention... there was a business report meeting at the Ministry of Land, Transportation, and Tourism.

335
00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:23.820
He's supporting so that Cheongyu Biotown will become Moksan area's main business.

336
00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:27.050
So, that must be why we're meeting like this, right?

337
00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:28.590
What?

338
00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:37.940
Architecture major falls under engineering. You must've been very popular.

I guess only you and I didn't know.

The group project... Do you want to work with me?

347

Do you know who I am?

348
00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.620
I know. Jeong Yoo Jin of entering class of 2004.

349
00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:36.150
If it's okay, do the project with me.

350
00:35:51.090 --> 00:35:55.940
Sunbaenim, I sent you a group text saying our class got cancelled last week. But why didn't you come to our gathering?

351
00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:58.460
We drank in the afternoon that day.

352
00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:01.560
Oppa, did you decide on the team for your group project?

353
00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:03.290
You're doing it with us, right?

354
00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:07.360
Oppa, are you working on your group project with Yoo Jin sunbae?

355
00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:12.160
- Who's that? 
 - Jeong Yoo Jin. The construction company that's building Wooseokdong.

356
00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:14.730
She's infamous for getting into our school with her dad's connections.

357
00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:17.110
That Sunbae lured you, huh?

358
00:36:17.110 --> 00:36:19.450
No, I asked her to work with me first.

359
00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:24.160
Why? I heard she sticks with a good student and walks away with a good grade.

360
00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:27.640
Even the professors give her high marks on other assignments.

361
00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:29.620
So, everyone avoids her for that reason.

362
00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:32.640
For that reason, she works extra hard.

363
00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:36.060
Being afraid that things would turn out like the rumor, she's not even tardy once.

364
00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:40.780
She's talented, too. I'm thinking of taking advantage of her this time.

365
00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:42.280
Bye.

366

Hey, what the heck?

367
00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:57.670
The next project for the Ministry of Land, Transportation, and Tourism is building residences.

368
00:36:57.670 --> 00:37:01.870
If Moksan city wins the bid, the land near biotown will be assigned.

369
00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:03.970
Regarding that project, Father...

370

If we're going to talk about work, let's meet again at the office. Not here.

00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:15.950
Or did you wish I had died instead of Yeon Soo?

472
00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:22.570
How could you say that to your mother?

473
00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:28.550
I can't?

474
00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:32.950
You say everything you want to say, Mom.

475
00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:34.720
You b****...

476
00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:36.990
Why am I the only bad person?

477
00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:41.100
You're the one who sent us there that day.

478
00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:46.880
Then, you should feel bad for me. Why do you keep making me feel bad?

479
00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:48.680
Get out...

480
00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:54.200
Get out... get out... get out! Get out!

481
00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:57.680
Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out!

482
00:49:57.680 --> 00:50:00.440
Get out! Get out!

483
00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:03.620
You b****! Get out!

484
00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:07.380
Get out! Get out! Get out!

485
00:50:37.330 --> 00:50:41.470
Dad... Go over to our house.

486
00:50:41.470 --> 00:50:43.280
What's wrong?

487
00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:46.140
Go and stay with Mom.

488
00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:50.250
Did you come out like this? Your shoes...

489
00:50:50.250 --> 00:50:55.320
Don't worry about me. Go and take care of Mom.

490
00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:58.630
I don't think Mom should be alone.

491
00:51:00.650 --> 00:51:02.030
Your mom said yesterday...

492
00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:05.540
Just go! Hurry up and go!

493
00:51:15.220 --> 00:51:19.710
<i>So that Seo Joo Won won't ruin the project making a mistake like his father did.</i>

494
00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:23.800
<i>Open your eyes wide and watch him at the construction site.</i>

495
00:51:50.830 --> 00:51:53.100
What are you doing here in this cold?

496
00:52:06.550 --> 00:52:08.880
What are you doing here in this cold?

497
00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:11.060
Why are you here?

498
00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:29.290
I was just thinking that I miss you. You really came.

499
00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:32.410
It's neat.

500
00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:35.880
Aren't you cold?

501
00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:38.970
What brings you here?

502
00:52:38.970 --> 00:52:40.780
Telepathy.

503
00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:44.490
I thought you might miss me.

504
00:52:46.770 --> 00:52:49.730
Why don't you go inside? Why are you out here?

505
00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:52.140
Stand up.

506
00:52:59.310 --> 00:53:01.620
Why?

507
00:53:01.620 --> 00:53:03.840
I don't want to go inside.

508
00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:11.540
Then, let's go somewhere. You'll catch your cold again.

509
00:53:28.820 --> 00:53:31.020
I'm okay.

510
00:53:31.890 --> 00:53:34.280
Let me down.

511
00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:37.860
I'll let you down when I see a shoes store.

512
00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:39.980
Stay on my back for awhile.

513
00:53:41.660 --> 00:53:45.880
♫ <i>Somehow we are</i> ♫

514
00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:47.680
It's nice.

515
00:53:49.340 --> 00:53:53.360
I like your scent.

516
00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:56.740
Why do you like sweat smell?

517
00:53:56.740 --> 00:54:01.570
Your sweat smell is different. I like it.

518
00:54:02.790 --> 00:54:07.410
You have such a unique taste. You've completely fallen for me.

519
00:54:09.610 --> 00:54:11.310
Yeah.

520
00:54:16.180 --> 00:54:18.850
I don't want to go home tonight.

521
00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:26.610
I don't want to go.

522
00:54:26.610 --> 00:54:33.110
Don't go then. Stay with me.

523
00:54:35.570 --> 00:54:38.760
I...

524
00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:42.940
...really hate myself.

525
00:54:42.940 --> 00:54:44.930
♫ <i>You're...</i> ♫

526
00:54:44.930 --> 00:54:49.650
Then, I guess I have to like you even more.

527
00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:55.120
I want to run away.

528
00:54:55.120 --> 00:54:59.460
Sure, why not? Where do you want to go?

529
00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:02.920
♫ <i>Inside this cold story</i> ♫

530
00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:06.190
I don't know. I've never gone away.

531
00:55:06.190 --> 00:55:10.230
♫ <i>You are a warm place</i> ♫

532
00:55:12.130 --> 00:55:14.080
Let's go somewhere.

533
00:55:17.470 --> 00:55:19.130
Okay.

534
00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:29.940
♫ <i>The day my heart melted,
You were by my side</i> ♫

535
00:55:43.610 --> 00:55:46.130
This is the only place I know.

536
00:55:46.130 --> 00:55:51.070
Or I felt like I'd run away with her.

537
00:55:51.070 --> 00:55:54.390
Oh... lay her down first.

538
00:56:10.570 --> 00:56:12.300
What's wrong with her?

539
00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:14.830
I don't know what happened.

540
00:56:14.830 --> 00:56:17.520
I came running because Moon Soo's dad called me.

541
00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:22.740
Aigoo... How upset was she alone that she's been knocked out?

542
00:56:22.740 --> 00:56:24.830
Let her sleep. I'll go.

543
00:56:24.830 --> 00:56:27.940
Oh, wait... wait...

544
00:56:27.940 --> 00:56:31.360
We were about to go out.

545
00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:35.110
Oh, yes. We were about to leave.

546
00:56:35.110 --> 00:56:37.670
I don't think you should leave her alone.

547
00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:41.320
Why don't you stay with her until she wakes up?

548
00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:42.940
Let's go.

549
00:56:43.970 --> 00:56:45.810
Pack up.

550
00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:12.260
- So cold. 
 - Didn't you have to go somewhere?

551
00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:13.830
- Why did you come out? 
 - Hey.

552
00:57:13.830 --> 00:57:17.720
You're an assistant to a romantic genre work. Yet you have no sense?

553
00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:21.490
Who do you think Moon Soo wants to see when she wakes up?

554
00:57:23.170 --> 00:57:24.990
You're a good friend.

555
00:57:24.990 --> 00:57:27.820
It's nice to get some air. Isn't it?

556
00:57:28.700 --> 00:57:32.530
How did you and Moon Soo meet?

557
00:57:32.530 --> 00:57:34.960
At the hospital.

558
00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:38.360
Moon Soon was in the building collapse accident and I was in a motorcycle accident.

559
00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:40.210
Motorcycle?

560
00:57:40.210 --> 00:57:43.970
I enjoyed fast speed in my younger days.

561
00:57:43.970 --> 00:57:44.940
Motorcycle...

562
00:57:44.940 --> 00:57:49.970
Don't look for words of consolation. I got what I deserved.

563
00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:55.460
I was out of mind acting all strong and bluffing.

564
00:57:55.460 --> 00:58:01.020
Gosh, I was totally crazy and completely annoying.

565
00:58:02.770 --> 00:58:06.610
So, how much of a fit do you think I threw?

566
00:58:06.610 --> 00:58:10.540
Saying I'd rather die than live on a wheelchair for the rest of my life.

567
00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:20.820
Do you think this was easy from the beginning?

568
00:58:20.820 --> 00:58:24.130
I'm finally okay with it now.

569
00:58:27.050 --> 00:58:31.280
I would've never made it thus far if I were alone.

570
00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:38.960
Thanks to that frustrating Moon Soo... She stuck around hearing all kinds of crap from me.

571
00:58:39.940 --> 00:58:44.860
So... I have to be good to Moon Soo.

572
00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:51.910
Ah! I thought of a place I want to go to. Let's go.

573
00:59:05.590 --> 00:59:07.840
Just a moment. Did it get caught somewhere?

574
00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:12.070
Take your time. I'm used to waiting.

575
00:59:14.930 --> 00:59:18.460
Um... the customers are complaining it's cold. I'll close the door...

576
00:59:18.460 --> 00:59:20.440
Ah, I'm sorry.

577
00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:24.160
There used to be a slope here, but it's gone.

578
00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:27.650
The customers kept tripping over it and falling down.

579
00:59:27.650 --> 00:59:30.120
How about wheelchairs if you remove that?

580
00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:33.260
We don't have any disabled customers.

581
00:59:33.260 --> 00:59:36.050
It's not that you don't have any disabled customers. You just don't accept them.

582
00:59:36.050 --> 00:59:38.830
We're packed right now. I'm sorry.

583
00:59:38.830 --> 00:59:42.560
What do you mean it's packed? We're perfectly fine.

584
00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:44.290
Let's go. They're looking at us.

585
00:59:44.290 --> 00:59:47.390
Who cares? Did we do something wrong?

586
00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:52.310
It's not that they don't exist just because you don't see them. They can't come here because it's so inconvenient.

587
00:59:52.310 --> 00:59:55.050
Let's go, Wan Jin. Let's go to a nicer place.

588
00:59:58.150 --> 01:00:01.350
I heard there's no threshold in Australia.

589
01:00:01.350 --> 01:00:05.150
In the US, there's a slope in the movie theaters so that disabled people can watch movies, not stairs.

590
01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:08.240
Yes, President, it's me.

591
01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:13.140
You know the dessert cafe on the first floor of our commercial building? When does the contract expire?

592
01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:16.720
Right? March is when they renew their contract, right?

593
01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:18.430
I don't want to have that store anymore.

594
01:00:18.430 --> 01:00:23.820
I know they do good business. But I don't want to do that this time around.

595
01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:28.210
No, I have more than enough rent as is.

596
01:00:28.210 --> 01:00:30.340
Am I doing this over money?

597
01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:34.730
If they have a good mindset, I can even lower their rent.

598
01:00:34.730 --> 01:00:38.090
In any case, tell this to the owner.

599
01:00:38.090 --> 01:00:44.410
Tell him to think it over as to what the problem is and if he's willing to fix it, I'll reconsider renewing the contract.

600
01:00:45.290 --> 01:00:47.430
Okay, goodnight.

601
01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:51.890
Do you own this building?

602
01:00:51.890 --> 01:00:55.820
Yeah. My family is a bit rich.

603
01:00:55.820 --> 01:01:01.210
Isn't that fortunate? Come see when they renew the contract.

604
01:01:01.210 --> 01:01:04.480
Should I talk to Moon Soo and remodel the place?

605
01:01:05.250 --> 01:01:08.460
Should I get rid of all the stairs in the building? Let's go.

606
01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:10.800
- Yes. 
 - Where are you?

607
01:02:11.770 --> 01:02:14.090
Wan Jin unni's place.

608
01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:17.000
How is Mom?

609
01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:21.700
She's sleeping. Don't worry. I'll be here until Auntie comes tomorrow.

610
01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:22.700
No, I'll come.

611
01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:25.300
<i>It's okay. Rest there.</i>

612
01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:27.650
<i>Moon Soo.</i>

613
01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:32.400
Your mom and I...

614
01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:39.800
We'll continue to be this way. It will be hard to change now.

615
01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:42.980
<i>So, don't get hurt unnecessarily.</i>

616
01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:49.000
<i>And don't be too concerned with us. But know this one thing.</i>

617
01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.800
Your mom acting this way...

618
01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:58.700
She's hurting. It's not because of you.

619
01:03:00.110 --> 01:03:02.180
I know.

620
01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.600
Yes.

621
01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:09.950
Yes.

622
01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:43.240
I thought you left.

623
01:03:47.590 --> 01:03:50.110
Where would I go leaving you here?

624
01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:54.520
Where is Unni?

625
01:03:55.420 --> 01:03:58.300
I think she left on purpose.

626
01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:12.900
Why are you out here?

627
01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:19.400
When I see you, I keep wanting to touch you.

628
01:04:31.830 --> 01:04:34.510
Do you feel better now?

629
01:04:42.930 --> 01:04:44.510
What?

630
01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:49.400
What would I have done without you?

631
01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:53.700
What do you mean without me? I'm here.

632
01:04:56.460 --> 01:04:59.710
I remember seeing you.

633
01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:05.700
There...

634
01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:11.600
I wasn't alone. I was glad you were there.

635
01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:14.500
I remember thinking that.

636
01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:21.000
I was like that, too.

637
01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.300
But I don't have other memories.

638
01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:31.200
We were together, but why did we meet just now?

639
01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:39.300
Tell me. You remember everything.

640
01:05:55.820 --> 01:05:59.030
Just leave what you don't remember.

641
01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:03.870
It's because you don't need to remember.

642
01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:08.000
That's for my own comfort.

643
01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:11.500
Then, do you want everyone to feel uncomfortable?

644
01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:14.300
It's better if one of us feel comfortable.

645
01:06:18.550 --> 01:06:20.260
Why?

646
01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:26.400
I think I said some mean things to my mom.

647
01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:30.000
It's okay to throw a fit every once in awhile.

648
01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.800
It's too exhausting to live kindly all the time.

649
01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:37.600
Why are you always on my side?

650
01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:43.400
Are you stupid? Because I like you.

651
01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:45.800
I like you, too.

652
01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:51.000
I like you so much...

653
01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:57.600
that I wonder if it's okay for me to feel this way.

654
01:06:57.600 --> 01:06:59.300
It's okay.

655
01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:03.780
You have to.

656
01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:15.200
If it weren't for that accident, I'm sure everything would've been perfect.

657
01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:25.100
Oppa.

658
01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
You came.

<i>After we allowed them three goals, we scored two goals 10 minutes into the second half chasing after them fiercely.</i>

660
01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:52.000
<i>Due to that, the offensive has been much more stronger.</i>

661

No, let's go together.

667
01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:23.300
I told you to eat slowly. I'll be back.

We will win.

01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:26.700
Yes, coming.

<i>It's a nerve racking moment.</i>

676

<i>Lee Gang Doo is ready to make the penalty kick.</i>

<i>Lee Gang Doo did it!</i>

681
01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:53.600
<i>He performed a miracle in the history of Korean soccer!</i>

<i>And everyone in Korea! Korea did it!</i>

<i>A dramatic penalty kick by Lee Gang Doo!</i>

684
01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:20.770
So, we have to work hard...

We have to be happier than anyone out there.
