00:00:07.906 --> 00:00:08.705
(Episode 44)

2
00:00:08.706 --> 00:00:11.036
Let's date, Ji An.

3
00:00:14.045 --> 00:00:15.876
I don't want to marry you.

4
00:00:16.675 --> 00:00:17.675
But...

5
00:00:18.815 --> 00:00:20.146
I want to at least date you.

6
00:00:21.916 --> 00:00:23.015
So...

7
00:00:24.116 --> 00:00:26.885
let's just date, Ji An.

8
00:00:32.226 --> 00:00:33.325
Let's do it.

9
00:00:35.196 --> 00:00:36.266
Dating only.

10
00:00:39.035 --> 00:00:40.236
At least that.

11
00:00:48.376 --> 00:00:49.406
Okay.

12
00:00:54.385 --> 00:00:55.416
Dating only.

13
00:00:57.416 --> 00:00:58.416
Fine.

14
00:01:00.855 --> 00:01:01.986
Dating only.

15
00:01:18.906 --> 00:01:20.445
But let's date for only a week.

16
00:01:24.115 --> 00:01:25.775
That's too short.

17
00:01:26.315 --> 00:01:27.716
What do you mean?

18
00:01:27.716 --> 00:01:30.456
They say the lord created the world in seven days.

19
00:01:31.285 --> 00:01:33.085
It's not fun if it's too long.

20
00:01:35.626 --> 00:01:36.626
Sure.

21
00:01:37.796 --> 00:01:39.326
It's not fun when it's too long.

22
00:01:45.766 --> 00:01:48.365
Then from now on, we...

23
00:02:10.196 --> 00:02:11.525
I'll call you later.

24
00:02:11.655 --> 00:02:14.425
But what happened to your work?

25
00:02:15.525 --> 00:02:18.095
Oh, right. I don't have time for a chat.

26
00:02:18.666 --> 00:02:19.835
I'll call you on my way there.

27
00:02:28.345 --> 00:02:29.875
What have I done?

28
00:02:41.155 --> 00:02:43.155
What? Is something wrong?

29
00:02:43.155 --> 00:02:44.995
I'm reporting to my girlfriend.

30
00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:47.196
What?

31
00:02:47.196 --> 00:02:49.736
Yong Gook just set me up with a junk shop.

32
00:02:50.196 --> 00:02:52.335
They know a few small factories,

33
00:02:52.335 --> 00:02:54.106
so I'm on my way to look for the machines.

34
00:02:54.106 --> 00:02:55.365
Really?

35
00:02:55.365 --> 00:02:57.335
I'm going to buy the machines today if I can.

36
00:02:57.476 --> 00:03:00.076
If the factory's okay, I'm going to take it too.

37
00:03:00.606 --> 00:03:04.215
Aren't you driving for way too long today?

38
00:03:04.416 --> 00:03:06.986
I have Secretary Yoo. We'll take turns driving.

39
00:03:08.016 --> 00:03:09.516
Be careful.

40
00:03:10.085 --> 00:03:11.555
Are you worried about me?

41
00:03:12.016 --> 00:03:13.425
Seriously.

42
00:03:14.025 --> 00:03:16.456
You shouldn't be on the phone while driving.

43
00:03:16.456 --> 00:03:17.756
I'll pick you up when you're off.

44
00:03:17.756 --> 00:03:18.796
See you later.

45
00:03:29.036 --> 00:03:30.175
Ji An!

46
00:03:30.536 --> 00:03:32.805
Ji An. Ji An.

47
00:03:33.446 --> 00:03:34.546
Ji Soo.

48
00:03:34.946 --> 00:03:36.275
What's wrong with you?

49
00:03:36.275 --> 00:03:38.115
It's just dating.

50
00:03:38.115 --> 00:03:40.046
Isn't that what people do at our age?

51
00:03:40.946 --> 00:03:42.115
What are you talking about?

52
00:03:42.115 --> 00:03:44.685
Are you going to marry Do Kyung now...

53
00:03:44.685 --> 00:03:46.486
if his family doesn't oppose to it?

54
00:03:46.486 --> 00:03:48.185
That's not true, right?

55
00:03:48.185 --> 00:03:51.256
People don't get married right away.

56
00:03:51.256 --> 00:03:52.525
They don't do that.

57
00:03:52.525 --> 00:03:55.625
You should date them first to know about them.

58
00:03:55.766 --> 00:03:57.536
So what is your problem?

59
00:03:57.536 --> 00:03:59.066
You should date him first.

60
00:04:00.236 --> 00:04:01.736
Haesung is worried...

61
00:04:01.736 --> 00:04:03.435
only about you joining the family.

62
00:04:03.435 --> 00:04:06.546
They only block you since they don't want marriage.

63
00:04:06.576 --> 00:04:09.476
So just tell them you won't do that for now.

64
00:04:09.476 --> 00:04:10.516
Also,

65
00:04:11.345 --> 00:04:13.546
as you date Do Kyung,

66
00:04:13.546 --> 00:04:15.345
you might not like him anymore.

67
00:04:15.345 --> 00:04:17.616
Even I don't know how I'll end up with Hyuk.

68
00:04:19.585 --> 00:04:21.655
Is that what you came up with all night?

69
00:04:22.426 --> 00:04:25.256
I'm sorry. This is all I can say.

70
00:04:25.256 --> 00:04:28.595
But after seeing how Mother treats me and Hyuk,

71
00:04:28.926 --> 00:04:31.436
I can't tell you...

72
00:04:31.436 --> 00:04:33.506
to pursue for love no matter what.

73
00:04:35.605 --> 00:04:37.235
We've already decided to do that.

74
00:04:38.076 --> 00:04:39.076
What?

75
00:04:39.506 --> 00:04:40.545
We...

76
00:04:41.545 --> 00:04:43.246
decided to date only.

77
00:04:43.876 --> 00:04:44.876
You did?

78
00:04:44.876 --> 00:04:46.215
Just for a week.

79
00:04:46.285 --> 00:04:47.446
"A week"?

80
00:04:48.045 --> 00:04:51.516
I just didn't want to do it for long.

81
00:04:51.516 --> 00:04:53.186
It'll be dangerous if it becomes long.

82
00:04:53.655 --> 00:04:55.285
I want to do something for him,

83
00:04:55.285 --> 00:04:57.756
but it's sad that I can't do anything...

84
00:04:57.756 --> 00:04:59.095
because we don't have rights to do that.

85
00:04:59.926 --> 00:05:01.095
A week only.

86
00:05:02.095 --> 00:05:04.235
Wouldn't that be okay?

87
00:05:38.535 --> 00:05:40.105
What are you doing?

88
00:05:43.576 --> 00:05:45.605
Tell your boss that you got punched.

89
00:05:48.775 --> 00:05:50.576
I'll kill you if you follow me again.

90
00:05:53.145 --> 00:05:54.715
He punched you?

91
00:05:56.956 --> 00:05:59.116
Do Kyung threw a punch at you?

92
00:05:59.826 --> 00:06:01.186
Are you sure it was Do Kyung?

93
00:06:05.295 --> 00:06:06.295
All right then.

94
00:06:11.595 --> 00:06:13.566
He threw a punch?

95
00:06:18.335 --> 00:06:20.045
It's turning nicely, right?

96
00:06:20.676 --> 00:06:23.016
- It looks as good as new. - It does.

97
00:06:27.585 --> 00:06:28.616
Hello.

98
00:06:29.145 --> 00:06:30.155
Hello.

99
00:06:30.285 --> 00:06:31.316
This is the place.

100
00:06:31.985 --> 00:06:33.256
That's the office you're looking at.

101
00:06:33.256 --> 00:06:36.496
If you turn around, you can see the wood.

102
00:06:36.795 --> 00:06:39.326
And this is the factory.

103
00:06:40.595 --> 00:06:41.626
Do you like it?

104
00:06:42.465 --> 00:06:43.496
This is nice.

105
00:06:46.735 --> 00:06:47.936
This is so nice.

106
00:06:53.275 --> 00:06:55.676
- Isn't it cold outside? - Hello.

107
00:06:55.975 --> 00:06:58.845
Mr. Baker said tonight's dinner is pizza.

108
00:06:58.845 --> 00:07:01.285
He let me make the dough, so I can practice.

109
00:07:02.215 --> 00:07:05.085
You don't need to. I'm cooking dumpling stew.

110
00:07:06.655 --> 00:07:10.126
Well, Ji Soo's dad handled everything.

111
00:07:10.326 --> 00:07:12.196
We don't need to worry about anything now.

112
00:07:12.496 --> 00:07:15.465
I'm sorry to have troubled you,

113
00:07:15.595 --> 00:07:18.136
but everything worked out now.

114
00:07:19.266 --> 00:07:20.535
Did it?

115
00:07:23.706 --> 00:07:25.905
(Mother from Haesung Group)

116
00:07:30.616 --> 00:07:32.145
Aren't you going to answer it?

117
00:07:33.215 --> 00:07:34.215
I will.

118
00:07:39.316 --> 00:07:40.556
Hello?

119
00:07:41.585 --> 00:07:43.525
It's cold. I don't want to eat pizza.

120
00:07:44.456 --> 00:07:45.996
- I'll cook dumpling stew. - Okay.

121
00:07:50.436 --> 00:07:51.735
Okay.

122
00:07:58.006 --> 00:08:00.746
What is it? Does your scary mother want to meet?

123
00:08:02.475 --> 00:08:03.616
Yes.

124
00:08:04.316 --> 00:08:07.386
Judging from her actions,

125
00:08:07.746 --> 00:08:10.316
before educating you and improving your status,

126
00:08:10.785 --> 00:08:13.056
she didn't want to put you on her registry, right?

127
00:08:13.386 --> 00:08:15.355
Yes. Even now, she probably...

128
00:08:15.355 --> 00:08:17.795
wants to meet me so she can persuade me.

129
00:08:18.256 --> 00:08:19.496
To send me abroad.

130
00:08:19.795 --> 00:08:22.996
I'm saying she has no right to force it on you.

131
00:08:23.535 --> 00:08:26.136
You're not her daughter.

132
00:08:26.266 --> 00:08:27.266
Legally speaking.

133
00:08:37.416 --> 00:08:39.786
It's just that you'd been living poorly,

134
00:08:40.546 --> 00:08:42.816
but you're a precious daughter by birth.

135
00:08:42.816 --> 00:08:44.816
I had not been living poorly.

136
00:08:44.816 --> 00:08:46.956
The fact that you think so is the problem.

137
00:08:47.686 --> 00:08:51.196
You haven't seen the world in your limited world.

138
00:08:52.995 --> 00:08:53.995
I'm sorry.

139
00:08:56.566 --> 00:08:57.896
I came to your family...

140
00:08:59.235 --> 00:09:02.536
on an impulse to rebel against my parents.

141
00:09:03.635 --> 00:09:04.975
I sincerely apologize.

142
00:09:05.975 --> 00:09:06.975
"To rebel"?

143
00:09:08.745 --> 00:09:10.446
When I was being dragged to the airport,

144
00:09:11.745 --> 00:09:13.485
I thought I couldn't' be Seo Ji Soo anymore.

145
00:09:14.345 --> 00:09:17.715
I thought I'd be back as a stranger, Choi Eun Seok.

146
00:09:18.416 --> 00:09:19.956
When I had this thought,

147
00:09:20.326 --> 00:09:22.056
I saw many things I hadn't seen before.

148
00:09:23.255 --> 00:09:26.865
I realized the love from my old parents was real.

149
00:09:27.865 --> 00:09:31.235
I missed Ji An, and I was sad to leave Hyuk.

150
00:09:31.735 --> 00:09:33.566
I was really sad and full of regrets.

151
00:09:34.206 --> 00:09:35.765
And I was so scared.

152
00:09:35.835 --> 00:09:39.306
Have you forgotten what they did to you?

153
00:09:39.706 --> 00:09:41.576
That wasn't important.

154
00:09:42.745 --> 00:09:45.245
I wasn't happy for the few months...

155
00:09:46.186 --> 00:09:48.146
which I lived with my real parents.

156
00:09:53.355 --> 00:09:55.355
It's because you haven't tried it yet.

157
00:09:55.786 --> 00:09:57.556
You haven't enjoyed the life yet.

158
00:09:58.556 --> 00:10:00.566
This is not a mere problem about money.

159
00:10:01.026 --> 00:10:02.896
No one can mistreat you.

160
00:10:03.036 --> 00:10:05.265
You can do everything you want in your life.

161
00:10:06.965 --> 00:10:10.036
How can you not understand my desire to give back...

162
00:10:10.235 --> 00:10:11.776
the best life you can have?

163
00:10:12.536 --> 00:10:14.505
Do you remember giving me your credit card?

164
00:10:15.206 --> 00:10:17.515
Have I used it even once?

165
00:10:19.316 --> 00:10:20.446
You're right.

166
00:10:21.245 --> 00:10:23.916
Why didn't you? It doesn't have a limit.

167
00:10:23.916 --> 00:10:26.085
I'm comfortable enough with the money I earn.

168
00:10:26.926 --> 00:10:29.286
I don't need money that much.

169
00:10:29.896 --> 00:10:32.026
To me, every food is delicious,

170
00:10:32.426 --> 00:10:33.725
and because of your good genes,

171
00:10:33.725 --> 00:10:35.365
I look good in anything.

172
00:10:35.595 --> 00:10:37.896
So I don't like going to famous restaurants,

173
00:10:37.896 --> 00:10:39.436
and I don't like going shopping either.

174
00:10:40.265 --> 00:10:41.566
That's why...

175
00:10:41.566 --> 00:10:43.306
I was happy for years with part-time jobs.

176
00:10:44.176 --> 00:10:45.806
I didn't need anything more.

177
00:10:46.546 --> 00:10:47.546
That's...

178
00:10:48.505 --> 00:10:51.646
You've grown accustomed to living poorly.

179
00:10:51.916 --> 00:10:54.446
That disappoints and upsets me.

180
00:10:54.446 --> 00:10:56.956
But because of that, I don't want to return.

181
00:10:57.456 --> 00:10:59.156
I don't want to live as Choi Eun Seok.

182
00:11:01.225 --> 00:11:02.255
What?

183
00:11:02.385 --> 00:11:04.225
I don't feel like...

184
00:11:05.125 --> 00:11:06.365
you're my mother at all.

185
00:11:09.196 --> 00:11:11.066
I'm not sad to let go...

186
00:11:12.036 --> 00:11:13.406
of all the privileges I can enjoy at Haesung.

187
00:11:14.465 --> 00:11:16.135
The only reason...

188
00:11:16.406 --> 00:11:17.936
I am grateful to you...

189
00:11:19.135 --> 00:11:20.546
is giving birth to me.

190
00:11:25.816 --> 00:11:26.946
Ji Soo.

191
00:11:28.446 --> 00:11:30.656
You don't need to go abroad for the time being

192
00:11:31.316 --> 00:11:33.956
Date that Sunwoo Hyuk you mentioned too.

193
00:11:34.786 --> 00:11:36.625
But come back home.

194
00:11:36.956 --> 00:11:38.426
Let's work this out step by step...

195
00:11:38.426 --> 00:11:39.666
It's too late.

196
00:11:40.896 --> 00:11:42.125
"It's too late"?

197
00:11:42.796 --> 00:11:44.965
What do you mean?

198
00:11:46.095 --> 00:11:47.936
Thank you for bringing me to this world.

199
00:11:48.335 --> 00:11:50.276
I just wanted to thank you for that.

200
00:11:51.735 --> 00:11:52.776
Goodbye now.

201
00:11:53.875 --> 00:11:54.906
You.

202
00:11:58.146 --> 00:11:59.646
You will regret it.

203
00:12:30.576 --> 00:12:31.946
Five minutes before arrival.

204
00:12:54.306 --> 00:12:55.335
Ji An.

205
00:12:59.505 --> 00:13:00.676
You're here.

206
00:13:02.505 --> 00:13:05.475
Let's go. I want to take the subway with you.

207
00:13:05.715 --> 00:13:08.985
We only have a week. Let's do everything others do.

208
00:13:09.515 --> 00:13:10.556
Should we?

209
00:13:10.556 --> 00:13:12.826
Let's hurry. I booked movie tickets.

210
00:13:17.255 --> 00:13:19.426
No, not that way. This way. Come here.

211
00:13:22.835 --> 00:13:25.135
Couples always stand over here.

212
00:13:30.335 --> 00:13:31.536
What on earth...

213
00:13:32.306 --> 00:13:34.576
It's dangerous near the door. Move away.

214
00:14:01.166 --> 00:14:03.235
It's unusually packed today.

215
00:14:45.215 --> 00:14:48.316
Don't you prefer watching me rather than the film?

216
00:15:12.335 --> 00:15:14.975
You're the ones who are clueless.

217
00:15:15.975 --> 00:15:19.316
Only the mother knew the truth.

218
00:15:24.416 --> 00:15:26.755
Because the mother of Kim Ja Hong...

219
00:15:26.755 --> 00:15:29.156
was unconscious at that time,

220
00:15:29.495 --> 00:15:32.255
the children were left behind.

221
00:15:32.255 --> 00:15:33.625
How dare you use those children?

222
00:15:33.625 --> 00:15:38.865
This is not acceptable. Did you understand that?

223
00:16:01.585 --> 00:16:03.826
That idiot.

224
00:16:04.026 --> 00:16:05.995
He was too sorry to see you.

225
00:16:06.196 --> 00:16:07.566
That's why he worked so hard...

226
00:16:07.566 --> 00:16:09.066
and he gave you all his money...

227
00:16:09.066 --> 00:16:11.936
even if he couldn't come home.

228
00:16:12.806 --> 00:16:15.936
He's an idiot.

229
00:16:16.235 --> 00:16:19.306
He was like that all his life.

230
00:16:19.776 --> 00:16:21.706
He was like that...

231
00:16:22.005 --> 00:16:23.676
all his life.

232
00:16:35.485 --> 00:16:38.026
My son...

233
00:16:38.456 --> 00:16:39.566
I...

234
00:17:18.465 --> 00:17:21.505
Do you think you would pass all seven trials?

235
00:17:21.866 --> 00:17:24.876
No. I lost my chance to be reincarnated.

236
00:17:24.876 --> 00:17:27.575
So I am going to give it my best shot in this life.

237
00:17:27.775 --> 00:17:29.745
I thought I'd be with you in our next life,

238
00:17:29.745 --> 00:17:30.815
but I guess not.

239
00:17:31.715 --> 00:17:33.245
You can't be reincarnated either.

240
00:17:33.245 --> 00:17:35.315
You will be found guilty for lying.

241
00:17:36.116 --> 00:17:37.485
You pretended not to like me.

242
00:17:37.886 --> 00:17:39.985
I never said that I don't like you.

243
00:17:39.985 --> 00:17:41.555
Right.

244
00:17:42.126 --> 00:17:44.426
You yelled at me and said you liked me.

245
00:17:44.426 --> 00:17:45.956
Come on.

246
00:17:47.025 --> 00:17:49.065
I am too hungry to be upset.

247
00:17:49.126 --> 00:17:50.636
Right? You are hungry, right?

248
00:17:50.636 --> 00:17:52.196
You can choose what to eat for dinner.

249
00:17:52.196 --> 00:17:54.265
I was trying to book a restaurant too,

250
00:17:54.265 --> 00:17:55.535
but I didn't know what you like.

251
00:17:55.965 --> 00:17:57.535
I don't know what you like.

252
00:18:04.245 --> 00:18:05.545
What are all these?

253
00:18:06.075 --> 00:18:07.616
It's what I always used to eat in college.

254
00:18:07.616 --> 00:18:09.245
You can eat a variety of things.

255
00:18:09.245 --> 00:18:10.715
Tteokbokki, cheese,

256
00:18:10.715 --> 00:18:12.086
chicken feet, and Jumeokbap.

257
00:18:14.285 --> 00:18:15.525
Do you eat chicken feet?

258
00:18:18.356 --> 00:18:19.795
I know how to eat it.

259
00:18:21.525 --> 00:18:24.596
You don't eat it, do you?

260
00:18:24.596 --> 00:18:25.636
I don't.

261
00:18:45.785 --> 00:18:47.755
That's not how you eat that, is it?

262
00:18:48.356 --> 00:18:49.456
What?

263
00:18:50.295 --> 00:18:52.456
Just do what you always do.

264
00:18:52.755 --> 00:18:54.825
I can eat like this too.

265
00:18:58.436 --> 00:19:00.166
I will eat it too...

266
00:19:01.265 --> 00:19:03.305
so you can eat it.

267
00:19:24.396 --> 00:19:25.396
Soo A,

268
00:19:25.956 --> 00:19:27.926
I'm making things too difficult for you.

269
00:19:28.666 --> 00:19:30.035
If you want...

270
00:19:30.495 --> 00:19:32.035
(Seung Won)

271
00:19:34.735 --> 00:19:36.775
Yes, Seung Won. What's wrong?

272
00:19:37.275 --> 00:19:38.575
Is Soo A not well?

273
00:19:38.975 --> 00:19:40.245
That's not it.

274
00:19:41.206 --> 00:19:43.376
Soo A told me not to tell you.

275
00:19:44.015 --> 00:19:46.815
But Soo A had a miscarriage.

276
00:19:49.315 --> 00:19:50.656
"A miscarriage"?

277
00:19:51.485 --> 00:19:53.626
This afternoon, she kept saying her stomach hurt.

278
00:19:53.856 --> 00:19:56.055
She's resting in my house right now.

279
00:19:56.055 --> 00:19:59.196
I thought you should know. That's why I called.

280
00:20:05.196 --> 00:20:07.936
I used to play alone well.

281
00:20:12.235 --> 00:20:13.346
I will take the empty glasses.

282
00:20:28.856 --> 00:20:30.525
Isn't that Seo Hyun?

283
00:20:32.495 --> 00:20:34.295
No way. That can't be.

284
00:20:41.035 --> 00:20:43.406
Why did he have to work here?

285
00:20:46.035 --> 00:20:47.575
By the way, why did I run away?

286
00:20:53.586 --> 00:20:54.946
- Excuse me. - My goodness.

287
00:21:11.096 --> 00:21:13.666
No way. I must be mad.

288
00:21:13.666 --> 00:21:15.366
Why do you keep thinking about him?

289
00:21:15.366 --> 00:21:17.106
Seo Hyun, are you in love with him?

290
00:21:17.106 --> 00:21:19.136
He's the son of my family's enemy.

291
00:21:19.136 --> 00:21:20.376
Come to your senses.

292
00:21:25.075 --> 00:21:26.785
I'm back in this neighborhood again.

293
00:21:27.916 --> 00:21:29.686
You always say you'll never come back.

294
00:21:29.686 --> 00:21:30.886
But you always come back.

295
00:21:31.616 --> 00:21:34.926
I should never use the word "never".

296
00:21:35.886 --> 00:21:36.956
Right.

297
00:21:37.656 --> 00:21:40.725
The word "never" is really meaningless.

298
00:21:40.765 --> 00:21:42.325
Don't you use that word often too?

299
00:21:44.836 --> 00:21:45.936
Let's stop here.

300
00:21:50.575 --> 00:21:51.575
Let's do that.

301
00:21:52.735 --> 00:21:54.446
If your parents see us,

302
00:21:54.745 --> 00:21:55.946
they will be worried.

303
00:21:57.846 --> 00:21:59.215
Thank you for seeing me home.

304
00:22:00.045 --> 00:22:01.285
But it's what I must do.

305
00:22:02.416 --> 00:22:03.985
It must be cold to get back home.

306
00:22:04.285 --> 00:22:06.485
I am going to run to the bus station.

307
00:22:06.485 --> 00:22:07.485
It will be a good workout.

308
00:22:08.456 --> 00:22:09.626
Take care of yourself.

309
00:22:11.396 --> 00:22:12.626
What do you want to do tomorrow?

310
00:22:24.706 --> 00:22:27.045
Is there nothing you want to do with me?

311
00:22:27.575 --> 00:22:31.575
My gosh. You never expected this to happen?

312
00:22:31.575 --> 00:22:32.775
I want to go to the movies, go for a walk,

313
00:22:32.775 --> 00:22:34.015
go to an art gallery,

314
00:22:34.015 --> 00:22:36.255
work out together, talk on the phone whenever I want,

315
00:22:36.255 --> 00:22:37.856
go to a bar and a cafe,

316
00:22:37.856 --> 00:22:39.386
and go to a theme park with you.

317
00:22:43.696 --> 00:22:44.896
"I'll see you tomorrow."

318
00:22:46.426 --> 00:22:48.465
I was overwhelmed to hear you say that.

319
00:22:57.406 --> 00:22:58.636
I'll see you tomorrow,

320
00:23:00.406 --> 00:23:01.606
Ji An.

321
00:23:05.846 --> 00:23:08.446
I'll see you tomorrow.

322
00:23:41.446 --> 00:23:42.446
Good morning.

323
00:23:42.446 --> 00:23:44.055
- Did you sleep well? - Yes.

324
00:23:45.356 --> 00:23:46.356
Those are men's clothes.

325
00:23:46.686 --> 00:23:48.926
Yes. Do Kyung must've hung these on the rooftop,

326
00:23:48.926 --> 00:23:49.926
and forgotten about them.

327
00:23:51.196 --> 00:23:53.166
How can you fold a man's underwear without shame?

328
00:23:53.166 --> 00:23:54.265
What? What's wrong?

329
00:23:54.265 --> 00:23:55.965
I have two brothers, so I'm used to it.

330
00:23:56.936 --> 00:23:58.495
Hyuk, could it be...

331
00:23:58.666 --> 00:24:00.065
that you're embarrassed?

332
00:24:01.465 --> 00:24:04.606
I will fold these. You fold the towels.

333
00:24:04.606 --> 00:24:06.075
Okay.

334
00:24:08.146 --> 00:24:10.545
You became bubbly after you met your mother.

335
00:24:10.545 --> 00:24:13.715
Yes. Thinking about people who care about me...

336
00:24:13.715 --> 00:24:15.386
made me very brave.

337
00:24:15.386 --> 00:24:17.186
So I told her everything in my chest.

338
00:24:17.186 --> 00:24:18.515
It felt so liberating.

339
00:24:19.285 --> 00:24:21.856
Then I should meet your father.

340
00:24:22.956 --> 00:24:23.995
My father?

341
00:24:24.426 --> 00:24:26.965
I helped you escape.

342
00:24:26.965 --> 00:24:28.825
So I should apologize to him...

343
00:24:29.196 --> 00:24:30.896
and ask his permission to see you.

344
00:24:31.765 --> 00:24:34.106
I feel sorry to let you go through it alone.

345
00:24:35.866 --> 00:24:38.406
My father is a really nice person.

346
00:24:38.406 --> 00:24:40.075
I am sure he will like you too.

347
00:24:44.346 --> 00:24:47.485
No Jin Hee went to Europe herself...

348
00:24:47.545 --> 00:24:50.916
and purchased the land for our new resort.

349
00:24:51.586 --> 00:24:52.616
Well done.

350
00:24:54.055 --> 00:24:57.396
Thanks to Mr. Jung's local connection,

351
00:24:57.396 --> 00:24:58.696
we were able to do business in Berlin.

352
00:24:58.696 --> 00:25:01.065
If Mr. Jung didn't succeed purchasing the land,

353
00:25:01.065 --> 00:25:02.866
we would've been in big trouble, right?

354
00:25:03.735 --> 00:25:06.065
Mr. Jung surely had a lot to do with it.

355
00:25:06.366 --> 00:25:08.305
- Good job. - Don't mention it, sir.

356
00:25:17.346 --> 00:25:18.775
Ms. No Myung Hee.

357
00:25:19.515 --> 00:25:20.515
Yes, sir.

358
00:25:20.515 --> 00:25:22.215
Until when...

359
00:25:22.416 --> 00:25:24.515
will you let Haesung FNB stay stagnant?

360
00:25:25.156 --> 00:25:27.555
A burger chain, a salad bar,

361
00:25:27.555 --> 00:25:29.995
and a Korean restaurant. You only have three.

362
00:25:30.456 --> 00:25:32.656
Stagnant water is bound to rot.

363
00:25:32.656 --> 00:25:35.225
You already have too many franchises.

364
00:25:35.325 --> 00:25:37.265
When will you launch the new brand?

365
00:25:37.265 --> 00:25:39.065
I told you to do it a long time ago.

366
00:25:39.065 --> 00:25:42.366
It got delayed because of the Vietnam expansion.

367
00:25:42.366 --> 00:25:45.235
It's the golden era of franchises,

368
00:25:45.235 --> 00:25:48.575
so we are trying to do something unique.

369
00:25:48.706 --> 00:25:49.715
Soon...

370
00:25:49.715 --> 00:25:51.116
The Vietnam expansion?

371
00:25:52.616 --> 00:25:54.646
It became Mr. Choi's responsibility...

372
00:25:54.646 --> 00:25:56.686
a long time ago. So why talk about it?

373
00:25:58.555 --> 00:25:59.856
I am sorry, sir.

374
00:26:01.985 --> 00:26:04.025
But more than that, until when...

375
00:26:04.025 --> 00:26:05.596
will Chief Director Choi be on leave?

376
00:26:06.126 --> 00:26:07.465
Now that the land is purchased,

377
00:26:07.465 --> 00:26:09.196
he should get to work.

378
00:26:09.196 --> 00:26:11.336
Shouldn't he be going to work now?

379
00:26:16.376 --> 00:26:17.636
Right.

380
00:26:19.745 --> 00:26:22.446
He wanted some time off from work to recharge,

381
00:26:22.446 --> 00:26:24.475
so I let him go on a long vacation.

382
00:26:26.785 --> 00:26:28.015
I am...

383
00:26:29.116 --> 00:26:30.386
ashamed to see the board members.

384
00:26:45.596 --> 00:26:46.735
Father.

385
00:26:49.975 --> 00:26:52.206
Sir, can we have a cup of tea?

386
00:26:52.505 --> 00:26:53.505
I am busy.

387
00:26:54.505 --> 00:26:56.876
- Let's go have some tea. - Of course, sir.

388
00:27:01.285 --> 00:27:02.285
Myung Hee.

389
00:27:02.586 --> 00:27:03.755
Let's get some tea.

390
00:27:07.025 --> 00:27:08.725
Don't annoy me, and just go.

391
00:27:55.265 --> 00:27:56.936
The number you have dialed is not available....

392
00:27:58.475 --> 00:27:59.475
What are you doing?

393
00:27:59.475 --> 00:28:00.975
I wanted to ask about my niece,

394
00:28:00.975 --> 00:28:02.346
but you won't let me.

395
00:28:03.446 --> 00:28:04.916
Let me see Eun Seok.

396
00:28:06.015 --> 00:28:07.346
Eun Seok went to study abroad.

397
00:28:11.315 --> 00:28:12.485
She went abroad?

398
00:28:15.555 --> 00:28:18.356
But I am not here to ask about Eun Seok.

399
00:28:18.356 --> 00:28:20.795
- It's Do Kyung. - He'll be back soon.

400
00:28:21.525 --> 00:28:24.965
Myung Hee. I've seen Do Kyung for years.

401
00:28:25.795 --> 00:28:27.535
I don't know who that girl is,

402
00:28:28.106 --> 00:28:29.906
but what if Do Kyung ends up giving up...

403
00:28:29.906 --> 00:28:31.436
Haesung Corporation for her?

404
00:28:31.436 --> 00:28:33.305
Stop talking nonsense.

405
00:28:33.545 --> 00:28:36.545
Edward VIII even abdicated for a woman.

406
00:28:36.775 --> 00:28:38.575
He did it to marry Wallis Simpson.

407
00:28:39.785 --> 00:28:42.045
You'd know because you were once blinded by love.

408
00:28:42.045 --> 00:28:43.055
Jin Hee.

409
00:28:43.055 --> 00:28:45.686
I heard the news about Jang So Ra.

410
00:28:47.525 --> 00:28:49.725
I didn't tell Father yet.

411
00:28:50.126 --> 00:28:51.896
That would make things really bad, wouldn't it?

412
00:28:52.495 --> 00:28:55.525
You still attack people with a smile on your face.

413
00:28:55.525 --> 00:28:57.396
This is why I hate you.

414
00:28:57.396 --> 00:28:58.965
I attacked you?

415
00:29:01.965 --> 00:29:04.406
Are you talking about the day you lost Eun Seok?

416
00:29:07.045 --> 00:29:08.075
Here.

417
00:29:15.916 --> 00:29:17.485
Come to Nanny's house in Yangpyeong.

418
00:29:17.485 --> 00:29:18.485
Drop off Eun Seok there,

419
00:29:18.485 --> 00:29:19.956
and we can leave together from there.

420
00:29:21.985 --> 00:29:23.025
Hello?

421
00:29:23.096 --> 00:29:25.396
Your husband hired someone to go after you.

422
00:29:25.656 --> 00:29:27.426
Did you not get busted yet?

423
00:29:31.065 --> 00:29:32.096
Eun Seok.

424
00:29:32.765 --> 00:29:33.765
Eun Seok...

425
00:29:36.235 --> 00:29:37.235
What?

426
00:29:46.715 --> 00:29:47.815
Where did you leave Eun Seok?

427
00:29:48.946 --> 00:29:50.386
Where did you leave Eun Seok?

428
00:29:55.886 --> 00:29:58.055
If it weren't for your false guess,

429
00:29:58.055 --> 00:29:59.666
I wouldn't have lost Eun Seok.

430
00:30:00.225 --> 00:30:04.035
You think it's my fault, don't you?

431
00:30:05.696 --> 00:30:08.465
You never hold yourself accountable, do you?

432
00:30:08.666 --> 00:30:11.176
That's why I will never let you have Haesung.

433
00:30:11.206 --> 00:30:13.275
Jung Myung Soo? Not a chance.

434
00:30:13.706 --> 00:30:16.045
I will make Do Kyung inherit it directly.

435
00:30:16.106 --> 00:30:18.275
I am competitive too.

436
00:30:19.745 --> 00:30:22.215
Besides, I think Father's changing his mind.

437
00:30:23.055 --> 00:30:24.416
It's exciting, isn't it?

438
00:30:26.555 --> 00:30:27.656
My goodness, Myung Hee,

439
00:30:28.856 --> 00:30:30.426
you look worried.

440
00:30:34.096 --> 00:30:35.825
I am too scared. I should hurry off.

441
00:30:36.396 --> 00:30:38.936
I will think about how to stir Father even more.

442
00:30:58.456 --> 00:31:01.356
By the way, do we have to clean again?

443
00:31:01.586 --> 00:31:02.755
Of course.

444
00:31:04.456 --> 00:31:05.495
Here.

445
00:31:06.265 --> 00:31:07.525
I have to get it done fast and go.

446
00:31:11.166 --> 00:31:13.535
Let's hurry up and do a trial run, make samples,

447
00:31:13.535 --> 00:31:14.606
get the quality checked,

448
00:31:14.765 --> 00:31:16.305
and decide when we will open the factory...

449
00:31:16.305 --> 00:31:17.975
and the packing design for the pellets.

450
00:31:18.176 --> 00:31:19.975
Please list down everything else we need.

451
00:31:20.575 --> 00:31:21.775
Don't worry.

452
00:31:22.206 --> 00:31:24.715
You should go. You can't waste a second.

453
00:31:25.376 --> 00:31:26.416
Thank you.

454
00:31:26.886 --> 00:31:28.116
Go easy on me for just a week.

455
00:31:30.456 --> 00:31:32.686
By the way, are you okay with just a week?

456
00:31:33.025 --> 00:31:34.025
We never know.

457
00:31:34.225 --> 00:31:36.755
Some miracle might happen.

458
00:31:39.295 --> 00:31:41.295
- We will go first. - Bye.

459
00:31:41.295 --> 00:31:42.495
See you tomorrow.

460
00:31:43.196 --> 00:31:44.396
Bye.

461
00:31:55.745 --> 00:31:57.346
(Ji Soo)

462
00:31:58.215 --> 00:31:59.275
Yes, Ji Soo.

463
00:31:59.646 --> 00:32:03.715
Ji An, I am going to introduce Hyuk to Father.

464
00:32:03.715 --> 00:32:06.055
I should let Mom and Dad meet him too.

465
00:32:06.186 --> 00:32:07.555
What does Dad do these days?

466
00:32:07.555 --> 00:32:08.626
When does he have time?

467
00:32:11.225 --> 00:32:12.325
Dad...

468
00:32:12.965 --> 00:32:14.396
is not at home.

469
00:32:14.596 --> 00:32:15.725
He's staying in Jeongseon.

470
00:32:16.166 --> 00:32:18.596
Jeongseon? His hometown?

471
00:32:18.866 --> 00:32:19.906
Why is he there?

472
00:32:20.265 --> 00:32:21.565
Actually,

473
00:32:21.936 --> 00:32:24.735
something happened to Dad.

474
00:32:31.759 --> 00:32:36.759
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E44 My Golden Life "Dating Only"</font>
<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

475
00:33:43.856 --> 00:33:45.315
You're finally surprised.

476
00:33:46.686 --> 00:33:48.485
When did you come?

477
00:33:50.696 --> 00:33:51.896
About an hour ago.

478
00:33:52.356 --> 00:33:53.565
"An hour ago"?

479
00:33:54.225 --> 00:33:55.426
What did you do for an hour?

480
00:33:55.426 --> 00:33:56.636
Why didn't you call me?

481
00:33:57.465 --> 00:33:58.495
For no reason.

482
00:33:58.836 --> 00:34:00.936
You should've called me.

483
00:34:01.706 --> 00:34:03.275
It's nearly 8pm.

484
00:34:07.245 --> 00:34:08.845
It was good enough.

485
00:34:12.146 --> 00:34:14.046
The flowers are wilted a little though.

486
00:34:17.055 --> 00:34:18.216
You even brought flowers.

487
00:34:25.095 --> 00:34:26.325
It's lovely.

488
00:34:28.626 --> 00:34:29.865
Is it your father?

489
00:34:30.265 --> 00:34:31.535
How did you know?

490
00:34:31.666 --> 00:34:33.336
I've met him before.

491
00:34:34.106 --> 00:34:35.436
It looks just like him.

492
00:34:37.006 --> 00:34:38.305
Were you going to paint it too?

493
00:34:38.305 --> 00:34:40.146
No. I can do it tomorrow.

494
00:34:40.575 --> 00:34:41.845
Let's paint it and then go.

495
00:34:58.555 --> 00:35:01.466
You can try painting the jeans.

496
00:35:01.966 --> 00:35:03.896
No. I can't do it.

497
00:35:04.066 --> 00:35:05.336
What if I ruin it?

498
00:35:05.566 --> 00:35:08.035
If you mess it up, I can paint over it.

499
00:35:08.966 --> 00:35:10.305
- Give it a try. - Really?

500
00:35:12.736 --> 00:35:13.876
Should I?

501
00:35:22.245 --> 00:35:23.285
That's it.

502
00:35:40.836 --> 00:35:43.836
Didn't I ruin your plans for this evening?

503
00:35:44.236 --> 00:35:45.936
You didn't want to eat seolleongtang, did you?

504
00:35:46.075 --> 00:35:47.106
I didn't have a plan.

505
00:35:47.675 --> 00:35:50.175
I was so busy that I only thought about...

506
00:35:50.175 --> 00:35:52.115
seeing you after work.

507
00:35:52.115 --> 00:35:53.986
I couldn't think about what to do.

508
00:35:55.445 --> 00:35:56.856
- Thank you. - My pleasure.

509
00:35:57.015 --> 00:35:58.285
Thank you.

510
00:35:58.285 --> 00:35:59.885
Please enjoy.

511
00:36:00.725 --> 00:36:02.995
You finished setting up the factory in a day?

512
00:36:03.425 --> 00:36:04.595
You're amazing.

513
00:36:04.925 --> 00:36:06.526
So are you.

514
00:36:06.995 --> 00:36:08.896
You didn't even hear me calling you.

515
00:36:08.896 --> 00:36:10.666
You were completely focused on your work.

516
00:36:11.436 --> 00:36:13.236
Were you like that when you worked on my lamp?

517
00:36:13.966 --> 00:36:15.236
Oh, that lamp.

518
00:36:16.975 --> 00:36:19.706
It was so hard to concentrate back then.

519
00:36:20.006 --> 00:36:23.276
By the way, what did you do with So Ra's lamp?

520
00:36:23.745 --> 00:36:24.816
I have it.

521
00:36:26.615 --> 00:36:28.546
Why do you have it?

522
00:36:28.785 --> 00:36:29.856
Well...

523
00:36:30.285 --> 00:36:31.986
So Ra is supposed to send me her address,

524
00:36:31.986 --> 00:36:33.486
but she hasn't sent it yet.

525
00:36:33.756 --> 00:36:35.256
"So Ra"? "Yet"?

526
00:36:36.655 --> 00:36:37.925
It sounds like you two are very close.

527
00:36:38.495 --> 00:36:40.365
No, that's not true.

528
00:36:40.365 --> 00:36:41.896
We've known each other since we were kids.

529
00:36:42.495 --> 00:36:43.566
Really?

530
00:36:48.635 --> 00:36:49.675
Are you upset?

531
00:36:50.836 --> 00:36:52.135
Why would I be upset?

532
00:36:52.405 --> 00:36:53.506
I'm just hungry.

533
00:36:57.975 --> 00:36:59.885
Gosh. Just eat.

534
00:36:59.885 --> 00:37:00.885
Okay.

535
00:37:03.686 --> 00:37:05.486
What did you eat with So Ra?

536
00:37:06.686 --> 00:37:07.725
What?

537
00:37:08.325 --> 00:37:10.956
It's nothing. You must be hungry. Let's eat.

538
00:37:11.195 --> 00:37:12.225
Okay.

539
00:37:18.436 --> 00:37:19.736
Where did you go with her?

540
00:37:28.905 --> 00:37:30.515
Where have you been?

541
00:37:30.515 --> 00:37:31.916
You haven't called me all day.

542
00:37:31.916 --> 00:37:33.486
Did you not get my calls?

543
00:37:33.916 --> 00:37:36.216
If it was urgent, you should've texted me.

544
00:37:37.086 --> 00:37:39.686
Where have you been after the meeting?

545
00:37:40.256 --> 00:37:41.686
I went out for some air.

546
00:37:42.456 --> 00:37:44.825
You went out for air after going through all that?

547
00:37:45.126 --> 00:37:46.595
Did you not hear what Father said?

548
00:37:46.595 --> 00:37:48.796
He's really upset with Do Kyung.

549
00:37:48.995 --> 00:37:50.265
I suppose so.

550
00:37:50.695 --> 00:37:52.966
And he was disappointed in me long ago.

551
00:37:52.966 --> 00:37:54.166
That's what I mean.

552
00:37:54.666 --> 00:37:56.135
Why are you acting like...

553
00:37:56.135 --> 00:37:57.876
as if you've given up on everything?

554
00:37:58.436 --> 00:37:59.845
For Do Kyung,

555
00:37:59.845 --> 00:38:02.506
you should get things together.

556
00:38:02.506 --> 00:38:03.575
That's not true.

557
00:38:04.345 --> 00:38:05.776
Your father approved of our marriage...

558
00:38:05.776 --> 00:38:08.245
to use me just this much.

559
00:38:08.845 --> 00:38:10.285
I was going to act as a bridge...

560
00:38:10.756 --> 00:38:12.716
for Do Kyung just in case...

561
00:38:12.716 --> 00:38:14.785
something happened to your father.

562
00:38:15.285 --> 00:38:18.396
I just did it for you and for my son.

563
00:38:18.856 --> 00:38:20.765
But I don't want to do that anymore.

564
00:38:21.425 --> 00:38:22.425
Why?

565
00:38:22.425 --> 00:38:25.166
I want to let Do Kyung do what he wants.

566
00:38:25.535 --> 00:38:29.106
So you'll have to convince him if you want.

567
00:38:42.916 --> 00:38:43.956
Wait.

568
00:38:46.756 --> 00:38:48.126
Wearing gloves is essential.

569
00:38:52.026 --> 00:38:54.695
I didn't do this. I didn't do this to So Ra.

570
00:38:55.695 --> 00:38:56.836
I didn't say anything.

571
00:39:00.436 --> 00:39:02.805
It's not fun to skate just like this.

572
00:39:03.175 --> 00:39:04.206
Do you want a bet?

573
00:39:04.575 --> 00:39:05.635
"A bet"?

574
00:39:06.245 --> 00:39:08.975
Okay. Let's go touch the door and come back.

575
00:39:09.646 --> 00:39:12.216
The one who loses will grant the winner's wish.

576
00:39:12.216 --> 00:39:14.046
- Okay? - Agreed.

577
00:39:17.186 --> 00:39:18.916
Ready.

578
00:39:19.356 --> 00:39:20.385
Start.

579
00:39:34.305 --> 00:39:35.506
My gosh.

580
00:39:47.686 --> 00:39:49.445
Can't you be more careful?

581
00:39:54.686 --> 00:39:55.856
Are you all right?

582
00:39:56.396 --> 00:39:58.456
I'm okay. But...

583
00:39:59.695 --> 00:40:00.825
What?

584
00:40:01.466 --> 00:40:02.896
Did... Did you get hurt?

585
00:40:03.695 --> 00:40:04.695
No.

586
00:40:05.336 --> 00:40:07.635
The game isn't over yet.

587
00:40:07.836 --> 00:40:08.836
Hey!

588
00:40:10.805 --> 00:40:11.805
Take your time.

589
00:40:26.986 --> 00:40:28.925
It's been so long since I saw her smile like that.

590
00:40:33.296 --> 00:40:34.865
I did it!

591
00:40:36.896 --> 00:40:39.436
What was that? Do you have motors on your feet?

592
00:40:39.436 --> 00:40:41.666
Yes! You should grant my wish.

593
00:40:41.836 --> 00:40:43.236
My goodness.

594
00:40:43.336 --> 00:40:45.535
What's your wish? I'll do whatever you want.

595
00:40:45.535 --> 00:40:47.506
It wouldn't be fun if I told you that now.

596
00:40:47.506 --> 00:40:49.475
I'll tell you at a very important moment.

597
00:41:20.706 --> 00:41:22.475
You're driving me home?

598
00:41:22.475 --> 00:41:24.975
How would I send you alone after that?

599
00:41:25.646 --> 00:41:28.115
This is one of the things I've wanted to do.

600
00:41:28.115 --> 00:41:29.756
I wanted to drive my boyfriend home.

601
00:41:31.256 --> 00:41:32.885
- Really? - Yes.

602
00:41:33.225 --> 00:41:35.986
And my tired boyfriend falls asleep in the car.

603
00:41:36.595 --> 00:41:37.595
Really?

604
00:41:37.756 --> 00:41:40.225
Then I should do that too.

605
00:43:35.245 --> 00:43:36.276
Mother.

606
00:43:43.856 --> 00:43:46.756
Ji An, we meet again.

607
00:43:52.325 --> 00:43:54.095
Can I ask...

608
00:43:54.095 --> 00:43:55.425
what is going on?

609
00:43:56.736 --> 00:43:58.035
- Mother. - No.

610
00:43:59.365 --> 00:44:01.966
I need this to be answered by Ji An.

611
00:44:03.635 --> 00:44:04.635
We decided...

612
00:44:05.876 --> 00:44:08.206
to date each other for just a week.

613
00:44:09.615 --> 00:44:10.646
What?

614
00:44:11.776 --> 00:44:13.686
You told me you wouldn't do anything.

615
00:44:14.515 --> 00:44:15.586
I'm sorry.

616
00:44:16.155 --> 00:44:17.615
I broke my promise.

617
00:44:19.526 --> 00:44:20.825
What does that mean?

618
00:44:21.325 --> 00:44:22.325
Mother.

619
00:44:22.325 --> 00:44:24.655
Do Kyung, let me talk to her.

620
00:44:25.356 --> 00:44:27.365
I promised something to her.

621
00:44:31.936 --> 00:44:32.966
I thought...

622
00:44:34.966 --> 00:44:36.106
I could...

623
00:44:36.836 --> 00:44:39.236
date him for just a week.

624
00:44:40.445 --> 00:44:41.945
Only for a week.

625
00:44:44.316 --> 00:44:45.575
For a week?

626
00:44:47.115 --> 00:44:48.486
I suggested that.

627
00:44:49.115 --> 00:44:50.555
You're here to see me.

628
00:44:52.186 --> 00:44:54.155
I'll send Ji An home in a taxi.

629
00:44:54.956 --> 00:44:57.595
Ms. Min, please take Mother to the car.

630
00:44:59.425 --> 00:45:00.495
Let's go.

631
00:45:02.966 --> 00:45:04.365
Do Kyung, this isn't right.

632
00:45:05.035 --> 00:45:06.095
I'll go alone.

633
00:45:06.095 --> 00:45:07.566
I'll call you when I get home.

634
00:45:09.606 --> 00:45:10.776
I'm leaving.

635
00:45:28.325 --> 00:45:31.256
It's too late. No cafes would still be open.

636
00:45:33.725 --> 00:45:36.296
I'll take you to where we can talk.

637
00:45:37.535 --> 00:45:40.336
Go to your place. Let's talk in your room.

638
00:45:41.135 --> 00:45:42.936
I can't let anyone in this house.

639
00:45:43.475 --> 00:45:44.936
Other tenants live there too.

640
00:45:50.416 --> 00:45:51.416
Welcome.

641
00:45:56.816 --> 00:45:58.416
- Two bowls of soup. - Sure.

642
00:46:02.356 --> 00:46:04.526
Why did you bring me somewhere like this?

643
00:46:04.626 --> 00:46:06.595
It's the only place open right now.

644
00:46:07.865 --> 00:46:08.896
Take a seat.

645
00:46:23.046 --> 00:46:24.075
First,

646
00:46:24.845 --> 00:46:27.546
leave Ji An and me alone for a week.

647
00:46:28.186 --> 00:46:31.586
I know Grandpa won't leave her family alone...

648
00:46:32.186 --> 00:46:35.026
if it gets any longer than that.

649
00:46:35.285 --> 00:46:37.595
You know what your grandpa's like...

650
00:46:37.595 --> 00:46:40.095
and you're foolish enough to ask for a week?

651
00:46:41.666 --> 00:46:43.736
He's really angry.

652
00:46:44.765 --> 00:46:45.836
I'm sure he is.

653
00:46:47.106 --> 00:46:50.236
Do Kyung, when will you come home?

654
00:46:51.876 --> 00:46:54.106
Move back in. Start your new business there.

655
00:46:54.106 --> 00:46:55.945
I'll let you do anything.

656
00:46:56.945 --> 00:46:58.876
I know you had other ideas...

657
00:46:59.945 --> 00:47:03.615
like White Bio because you're young and curious.

658
00:47:03.885 --> 00:47:05.856
Do it. I'll let you.

659
00:47:06.586 --> 00:47:08.686
You can do that as a subsidiary business.

660
00:47:08.986 --> 00:47:10.055
That would be...

661
00:47:10.425 --> 00:47:12.325
living in Grandpa's shadow.

662
00:47:12.925 --> 00:47:14.695
I just barely managed to start.

663
00:47:15.325 --> 00:47:17.296
Shouldn't I need to succeed first?

664
00:47:18.066 --> 00:47:19.396
Start what?

665
00:47:19.936 --> 00:47:21.836
I found another factory.

666
00:47:23.405 --> 00:47:25.075
What? How?

667
00:47:25.206 --> 00:47:27.445
Grandpa isn't all-knowing or all-seeing.

668
00:47:28.745 --> 00:47:30.816
Do you think he'll let you be?

669
00:47:30.816 --> 00:47:32.546
If he stops me again,

670
00:47:33.385 --> 00:47:34.945
I'll start smaller.

671
00:47:35.416 --> 00:47:37.186
If I start with a street stall,

672
00:47:37.856 --> 00:47:39.486
how will he stop me then?

673
00:47:39.956 --> 00:47:41.086
What?

674
00:47:41.325 --> 00:47:42.356
A street stall?

675
00:47:42.825 --> 00:47:44.995
If he pushes me that far,

676
00:47:45.725 --> 00:47:47.765
I might sell all my shares.

677
00:47:48.466 --> 00:47:51.566
Even a cornered rat deserves a way out.

678
00:47:53.566 --> 00:47:56.706
Are you going to take your grandpa head-on?

679
00:47:57.936 --> 00:47:59.805
It's fun to do things by myself.

680
00:48:00.606 --> 00:48:02.445
I told him so.

681
00:48:03.646 --> 00:48:05.716
I told him that I won't come back,

682
00:48:06.316 --> 00:48:07.345
but he won't give up.

683
00:48:09.445 --> 00:48:11.155
You met him?

684
00:48:12.115 --> 00:48:13.486
He didn't tell you?

685
00:48:14.785 --> 00:48:16.325
I went to Yangpyeong myself.

686
00:48:17.526 --> 00:48:18.995
What did you tell him?

687
00:48:19.095 --> 00:48:21.396
Did you say you wouldn't come back?

688
00:48:23.265 --> 00:48:24.666
Is that why he...

689
00:48:26.736 --> 00:48:28.606
What are you doing?

690
00:48:29.265 --> 00:48:30.276
Mom.

691
00:48:31.135 --> 00:48:32.475
I can't do as I'm told...

692
00:48:33.206 --> 00:48:35.206
and live like Grandpa's dog.

693
00:48:37.475 --> 00:48:38.475
So...

694
00:48:39.615 --> 00:48:40.785
I'd like you...

695
00:48:41.546 --> 00:48:42.745
to leave me alone too.

696
00:48:57.695 --> 00:48:58.896
(Do Kyung)

697
00:49:00.706 --> 00:49:01.706
Hello?

698
00:49:02.466 --> 00:49:03.675
Did you get home safely?

699
00:49:04.405 --> 00:49:07.776
Was Ms. No very angry?

700
00:49:09.106 --> 00:49:11.046
I shouldn't have offered to drive.

701
00:49:11.945 --> 00:49:12.945
No.

702
00:49:13.345 --> 00:49:16.586
A week is more than enough to get caught.

703
00:49:21.055 --> 00:49:22.856
How could you yawn at a time like...

704
00:49:37.675 --> 00:49:39.905
You could've asked to meet at a cafe.

705
00:49:44.015 --> 00:49:45.776
Are you just dropping off the divorce papers?

706
00:49:48.115 --> 00:49:49.756
Get in the car first.

707
00:49:57.126 --> 00:49:58.225
What's this car?

708
00:50:07.606 --> 00:50:09.006
Where are we going?

709
00:50:09.776 --> 00:50:12.075
It won't take long. Get some rest.

710
00:50:22.146 --> 00:50:23.285
Where are we?

711
00:50:24.055 --> 00:50:25.055
Just get out.

712
00:50:46.876 --> 00:50:48.405
Get some rest.

713
00:50:48.776 --> 00:50:51.046
What are you doing? Let's talk first.

714
00:50:51.716 --> 00:50:53.686
Sleep for about an hour.

715
00:50:54.486 --> 00:50:56.155
You look tired. Your eyes are red.

716
00:50:57.256 --> 00:50:58.756
We can talk after that.

717
00:51:26.945 --> 00:51:28.146
What's all this?

718
00:51:29.756 --> 00:51:31.986
Why did you come out? I was about to get you.

719
00:51:33.126 --> 00:51:35.425
Sit. Let's eat.

720
00:51:49.575 --> 00:51:53.146
A miscarriage is just like giving birth.

721
00:51:55.075 --> 00:51:57.115
You need to recover from it.

722
00:51:57.975 --> 00:52:01.845
Your friend wouldn't have cooked this soup for you.

723
00:52:02.885 --> 00:52:03.916
What?

724
00:52:06.086 --> 00:52:07.885
Your mom lives abroad.

725
00:52:08.586 --> 00:52:11.296
I'm the only person you can lean on.

726
00:52:12.695 --> 00:52:14.526
You couldn't tell me you were in pain...

727
00:52:15.495 --> 00:52:17.365
or that you miscarried.

728
00:52:20.166 --> 00:52:21.405
Sorry, Soo A.

729
00:52:23.236 --> 00:52:26.106
What have I done to you?

730
00:52:32.615 --> 00:52:35.615
Have some of the soup first.

731
00:52:36.615 --> 00:52:38.115
You look terrible.

732
00:52:39.956 --> 00:52:40.986
Seo Ji Tae.

733
00:52:43.155 --> 00:52:44.526
Why are you doing this to me?

734
00:52:46.055 --> 00:52:49.126
What if I didn't miscarry? What if it was abortion?

735
00:52:49.796 --> 00:52:50.936
Even so,

736
00:52:51.765 --> 00:52:53.265
you still need to eat this.

737
00:52:53.936 --> 00:52:54.966
You should recover.

738
00:52:59.945 --> 00:53:01.945
Eat up, would you?

739
00:53:04.515 --> 00:53:05.816
I didn't miscarry.

740
00:53:07.416 --> 00:53:08.416
What?

741
00:53:09.046 --> 00:53:10.856
It's our child.

742
00:53:11.256 --> 00:53:13.856
How could I get rid of it without your permission?

743
00:53:16.325 --> 00:53:18.595
I wanted to make you give up.

744
00:53:19.666 --> 00:53:20.925
I hated it.

745
00:53:22.066 --> 00:53:23.135
What's the use...

746
00:53:23.765 --> 00:53:26.535
of having a baby if I don't have you?

747
00:53:27.805 --> 00:53:29.066
I felt like that,

748
00:53:30.135 --> 00:53:32.035
but you just wanted the baby.

749
00:53:32.135 --> 00:53:33.876
You wanted to divorce me.

750
00:53:36.276 --> 00:53:37.615
Did you lie?

751
00:53:39.245 --> 00:53:40.285
I'm sorry.

752
00:53:43.316 --> 00:53:45.055
I wanted to find out...

753
00:53:47.026 --> 00:53:48.725
what I'd mean to you...

754
00:53:49.126 --> 00:53:50.425
if I'd lost the baby.

755
00:53:51.425 --> 00:53:52.456
I'm sorry.

756
00:53:52.865 --> 00:53:54.066
Soo A.

757
00:53:54.466 --> 00:53:56.495
Don't you know what you mean to me?

758
00:53:57.195 --> 00:53:59.765
I was anti-marriage, but I married you.

759
00:53:59.905 --> 00:54:02.905
I love that baby because that baby is ours.

760
00:54:03.675 --> 00:54:06.035
I didn't want to lose you or the baby, but...

761
00:54:08.546 --> 00:54:10.216
I couldn't torture you anymore.

762
00:54:11.716 --> 00:54:13.316
I was texting to say...

763
00:54:13.986 --> 00:54:15.986
you could do what you really wanted...

764
00:54:16.515 --> 00:54:17.956
when I got the call.

765
00:54:19.086 --> 00:54:20.225
Really?

766
00:54:22.486 --> 00:54:23.856
Then what about the baby?

767
00:54:25.995 --> 00:54:27.066
I don't know.

768
00:54:27.796 --> 00:54:29.126
You raise the baby.

769
00:54:29.666 --> 00:54:31.066
I'll only give birth.

770
00:55:02.796 --> 00:55:03.995
Come with us.

771
00:55:04.796 --> 00:55:08.635
No, you two can go. That's best for your dad.

772
00:55:10.175 --> 00:55:12.405
You were never scared of Dad.

773
00:55:14.506 --> 00:55:17.316
He was never this angry.

774
00:55:17.316 --> 00:55:18.745
This is serious.

775
00:55:19.175 --> 00:55:20.816
I'll visit some time later.

776
00:55:20.885 --> 00:55:23.885
Get ready while I pack the rest.

777
00:55:29.425 --> 00:55:30.456
Ji An.

778
00:55:32.126 --> 00:55:34.695
The chivalrous Mr. Sunwoo.

779
00:55:34.695 --> 00:55:36.296
Giving me a day off, lending us your car,

780
00:55:36.296 --> 00:55:37.666
and even driving my sister here.

781
00:55:37.666 --> 00:55:38.936
And carrying this too.

782
00:55:39.606 --> 00:55:41.436
Wait in the car. You too, Ji Soo.

783
00:55:41.436 --> 00:55:42.466
Okay.

784
00:55:42.836 --> 00:55:44.905
It's just like a date. Did you enjoy the drive?

785
00:55:45.006 --> 00:55:47.146
I wouldn't have done this if I could drive myself.

786
00:55:47.146 --> 00:55:48.745
He has to get back on his own.

787
00:55:48.745 --> 00:55:50.816
Then do you want to drop him off on our way?

788
00:55:50.816 --> 00:55:52.445
- Yes. - Hey, hey.

789
00:55:52.716 --> 00:55:53.986
I'm not a kid.

790
00:55:54.385 --> 00:55:56.285
Drop me off at the bus stop.

791
00:55:56.285 --> 00:55:58.055
- Get in, it's cold. - Okay.

792
00:55:59.115 --> 00:56:00.325
My gosh, it's cold.

793
00:56:08.066 --> 00:56:10.135
You can't cry when you see him.

794
00:56:10.135 --> 00:56:12.296
We're all pretending not to care.

795
00:56:12.966 --> 00:56:14.466
I think I'll cry.

796
00:56:14.466 --> 00:56:16.106
You can't.

797
00:56:16.106 --> 00:56:18.135
The present needs to smile, not cry.

798
00:56:18.975 --> 00:56:20.106
The present?

799
00:56:20.575 --> 00:56:22.745
Your return...

800
00:56:22.745 --> 00:56:24.916
will be a huge gift to him.

801
00:56:24.916 --> 00:56:27.686
So put up your best smile. You're good at that.

802
00:56:27.916 --> 00:56:29.785
But shouldn't we apologize...

803
00:56:29.785 --> 00:56:31.686
to make him feel better?

804
00:56:32.586 --> 00:56:35.256
What good will an apology do now?

805
00:56:35.256 --> 00:56:36.396
They're just words.

806
00:56:37.356 --> 00:56:40.595
I forgot, and you forgot.

807
00:56:41.026 --> 00:56:42.896
We'd all forgotten.

808
00:56:43.836 --> 00:56:46.765
We had more good days than bad, but we forgot.

809
00:56:46.966 --> 00:56:50.106
We need to remind him that we remember all that...

810
00:56:50.106 --> 00:56:51.876
to make him feel better.

811
00:56:52.535 --> 00:56:53.706
That's true.

812
00:56:54.305 --> 00:56:55.805
It was really strange.

813
00:56:56.106 --> 00:56:57.245
Resentment and misunderstandings...

814
00:56:57.245 --> 00:56:59.175
held me back,

815
00:56:59.486 --> 00:57:02.546
but that went away when I remembered our memories.

816
00:57:03.486 --> 00:57:04.986
We loved each other.

817
00:57:05.356 --> 00:57:06.856
We had good times.

818
00:57:07.885 --> 00:57:09.925
These people meant a lot to me.

819
00:57:13.365 --> 00:57:14.526
Who are you?

820
00:57:15.126 --> 00:57:16.566
Are you really Seo Ji Soo?

821
00:57:16.966 --> 00:57:19.166
Seo Ji Soo grew up.

822
00:57:19.436 --> 00:57:21.135
You really grew up a lot.

823
00:57:21.135 --> 00:57:22.666
Is it the power of love?

824
00:57:23.236 --> 00:57:24.836
In a way.

825
00:57:25.206 --> 00:57:26.745
Hyuk told me...

826
00:57:27.575 --> 00:57:29.745
that he liked me just the way I am.

827
00:57:41.225 --> 00:57:43.356
If he pushes me that far,

828
00:57:44.055 --> 00:57:46.166
I might sell all my shares.

829
00:57:47.026 --> 00:57:50.035
Are you going to take your grandpa head-on?

830
00:57:50.336 --> 00:57:52.495
It's fun to do things by myself.

831
00:57:53.006 --> 00:57:55.236
I told him that I won't come back,

832
00:57:55.666 --> 00:57:57.106
but he won't give up.

833
00:57:59.405 --> 00:58:01.706
If Do Kyung doesn't see reason this time,

834
00:58:02.745 --> 00:58:04.475
he's out of my plans forever.

835
00:58:14.126 --> 00:58:16.456
Mr. Jung surely had a lot to do with it.

836
00:58:16.825 --> 00:58:18.856
- Good job. - Don't mention it, sir.

837
00:58:19.396 --> 00:58:22.396
He wanted some time off from work to recharge,

838
00:58:22.396 --> 00:58:24.436
so I let him go on a long vacation.

839
00:58:24.566 --> 00:58:25.796
I am...

840
00:58:26.905 --> 00:58:28.135
ashamed to see the board members.

841
00:58:46.986 --> 00:58:48.626
Have you lost your mind?

842
00:59:03.776 --> 00:59:05.276
He must've been waiting for you.

843
00:59:10.716 --> 00:59:12.015
Don't you cry.

844
00:59:21.325 --> 00:59:22.956
- Dad. - Hi.

845
00:59:25.595 --> 00:59:27.666
Yes, it's good to see you too.

846
00:59:28.825 --> 00:59:30.896
Are you okay?

847
00:59:30.896 --> 00:59:32.936
Yes, thanks to you.

848
00:59:32.936 --> 00:59:36.905
You signaled to Ji An that I was acting strange.

849
00:59:36.905 --> 00:59:39.805
That I was going abroad when I wouldn't want to.

850
00:59:40.506 --> 00:59:42.606
I just felt like that.

851
00:59:42.916 --> 00:59:46.015
I know you, so I got worried.

852
00:59:46.586 --> 00:59:49.086
This is really unfair, Dad.

853
00:59:49.086 --> 00:59:50.416
Why won't you tell Ji Soo...

854
00:59:50.416 --> 00:59:51.885
to just go away?

855
00:59:51.885 --> 00:59:53.626
I feel left out.

856
00:59:53.925 --> 00:59:55.356
She's not like you.

857
00:59:56.695 --> 01:00:00.995
Wait, are you saying she's yours and I'm not?

858
01:00:01.325 --> 01:00:04.166
This is why I got upset and left home.

859
01:00:04.595 --> 01:00:06.566
No, Ji Soo, it's not that.

860
01:00:06.566 --> 01:00:07.865
It's not that at all.

861
01:00:07.865 --> 01:00:11.376
Is it not? If not, turn it inside-out.

862
01:00:11.836 --> 01:00:12.876
What?

863
01:00:16.876 --> 01:00:18.916
You're so good at that.

864
01:00:20.186 --> 01:00:23.055
Why did you bring so much again?

865
01:00:23.055 --> 01:00:25.115
You're acting cold to me again.

866
01:00:25.115 --> 01:00:27.126
Ji Soo brought stuff too.

867
01:00:27.186 --> 01:00:28.186
Dad.

868
01:00:28.456 --> 01:00:30.756
I made this bread myself.

869
01:00:31.495 --> 01:00:32.756
- "Bread"? - Yes.

870
01:00:32.756 --> 01:00:34.695
It's really easy on the stomach.

871
01:00:34.695 --> 01:00:36.236
Why don't you try some now?

872
01:00:37.365 --> 01:00:38.865
Well, okay.

873
01:00:38.865 --> 01:00:40.135
(Block Bakery)

874
01:00:40.135 --> 01:00:42.006
Let him eat inside where it's warm.

875
01:00:42.006 --> 01:00:43.776
Dad, can we come inside?

876
01:00:44.006 --> 01:00:45.836
Yes, of course.

877
01:00:46.106 --> 01:00:47.845
I'm hungry.

878
01:00:47.945 --> 01:00:49.575
You haven't eaten yet?

879
01:00:50.515 --> 01:00:53.646
There aren't any nice restaurants nearby.

880
01:00:53.785 --> 01:00:55.546
There must be a Chinese restaurant.

881
01:00:55.546 --> 01:00:57.285
I want jjajangmyeon.

882
01:00:57.986 --> 01:00:59.186
That sounds great.

883
01:01:07.325 --> 01:01:08.325
It's so good.

884
01:01:09.836 --> 01:01:10.865
I came here...

885
01:01:11.495 --> 01:01:14.035
with your grandparents, you know.

886
01:01:15.035 --> 01:01:17.035
With our grandparents?

887
01:01:20.345 --> 01:01:22.405
- Doesn't it look good? - It looks tasty.

888
01:01:22.606 --> 01:01:23.945
Mr. Seo.

889
01:01:24.376 --> 01:01:27.316
Tae Soo does such a good job...

890
01:01:27.316 --> 01:01:29.615
delivering the food, so this is on me.

891
01:01:29.615 --> 01:01:30.716
Enjoy yourselves.

892
01:01:30.716 --> 01:01:33.126
- Thanks. I'll do my best. - Sure, you do that.

893
01:01:33.126 --> 01:01:34.186
Thanks, Tae Soo.

894
01:01:34.186 --> 01:01:35.785
- Eat all you want. - Okay.

895
01:01:36.456 --> 01:01:38.526
- Good boy. - It looks so good.

896
01:01:52.736 --> 01:01:54.305
You seem to be eating fine.

897
01:01:55.945 --> 01:01:59.376
Dad, come back home after a month, okay?

898
01:02:02.046 --> 01:02:05.015
I can't. I don't want to burden you.

899
01:02:06.986 --> 01:02:10.225
Mom's so discouraged.

900
01:02:23.776 --> 01:02:26.606
He looked like a real patient.

901
01:02:27.345 --> 01:02:30.175
I guess the mind really does govern the body.

902
01:02:31.546 --> 01:02:34.086
That's because he believes he's sick.

903
01:02:34.146 --> 01:02:35.785
It hasn't been long.

904
01:02:39.316 --> 01:02:40.356
Who is it?

905
01:02:42.626 --> 01:02:43.796
Hello?

906
01:02:44.055 --> 01:02:45.495
It's Ji Soo's dad.

907
01:02:47.466 --> 01:02:48.566
Vice Chairman Choi.

908
01:02:49.736 --> 01:02:51.236
How are you?

909
01:02:52.365 --> 01:02:55.236
I'd like to meet you today.

910
01:02:59.805 --> 01:03:00.905
Just a moment.

911
01:03:01.745 --> 01:03:02.916
The samples came out great.

912
01:03:02.916 --> 01:03:04.445
I'll send them for quality testing.

913
01:03:05.075 --> 01:03:06.986
- Okay. - Okay.

914
01:03:09.856 --> 01:03:11.686
I don't want it to look complicated.

915
01:03:11.686 --> 01:03:13.925
A simple, warm look will do.

916
01:03:14.026 --> 01:03:16.995
Yes. Call me when you have the first draft. Bye.

917
01:03:19.695 --> 01:03:21.026
(Ji An)

918
01:03:22.296 --> 01:03:24.265
Hi, Ji An, I'm done.

919
01:03:24.736 --> 01:03:27.336
Let's postpone an hour. Something came up.

920
01:03:28.066 --> 01:03:29.365
What's wrong?

921
01:03:29.365 --> 01:03:32.135
I'll tell you later. Hang up for now.

922
01:03:35.745 --> 01:03:36.945
(Father)

923
01:03:38.716 --> 01:03:39.745
Hi, Dad.

924
01:03:39.745 --> 01:03:42.046
Do Kyung, can we meet up?

925
01:04:02.206 --> 01:04:03.436
Do Kyung.

926
01:04:05.175 --> 01:04:06.876
Did my dad call you?

927
01:04:08.046 --> 01:04:09.106
Yes.

928
01:04:10.816 --> 01:04:12.146
What's going on?

929
01:04:13.486 --> 01:04:14.686
Why did he...

930
01:04:15.515 --> 01:04:17.356
call us separately?

931
01:04:36.675 --> 01:04:38.006
You came together.

932
01:04:38.776 --> 01:04:40.975
No, we met downstairs.

933
01:04:42.075 --> 01:04:43.575
Mom, you're here too.

934
01:04:45.546 --> 01:04:46.586
Sit.

935
01:04:58.695 --> 01:05:00.725
I didn't want to be disturbed,

936
01:05:00.725 --> 01:05:02.365
so I ordered tea.

937
01:05:03.695 --> 01:05:06.365
Could you serve us some tea?

938
01:05:08.506 --> 01:05:09.575
Sure.

939
01:05:23.055 --> 01:05:24.285
I'll do it.

940
01:05:29.385 --> 01:05:30.725
What a mess.

941
01:05:35.796 --> 01:05:36.896
Sit down.

942
01:06:04.126 --> 01:06:06.526
Fine. I lost.

943
01:06:10.635 --> 01:06:12.265
Let's talk with the kids.

944
01:06:13.166 --> 01:06:14.236
Have a seat.

945
01:06:24.075 --> 01:06:26.416
I admit that I lost to you.

946
01:06:33.285 --> 01:06:35.285
Mother is allowing you to get married.

947
01:06:36.526 --> 01:06:37.626
You...

948
01:06:40.566 --> 01:06:41.626
should get married.
