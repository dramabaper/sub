1
00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.580
(One winter day...)

2
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.209
(with snow piled up)

3
00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:15.380
(Master and we met.)

4
00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.320
(After a long way,)

5
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.279
(they arrived at...)

6
00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.720
(the snowy mountain...)

7
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.219
(in Inje, Gangwon Province.)

8
00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:28.129
(One man arrived there.)

9
00:00:28.129 --> 00:00:29.460
- See you tomorrow. - Yes.

10
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.460
Yes. Okay. See you tomorrow.

11
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.530
(After saying goodbye to his manager,)

12
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.530
(he enters a cafe early in the morning.)

13
00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:36.899
The sun's not even up yet.

14
00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:42.340
(Seung Gi who is energetic even in the morning is here.)

15
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.840
- Hello. - Seung Gi.

16
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.850
You're the gym man.

17
00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:50.119
(After Se Hyeong and Seung Gi, Sang Yun is here too.)

18
00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:51.119
You're here.

19
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.119
(Is white trendy?)

20
00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:57.219
- Hello. - You scared me.

21
00:00:57.659 --> 00:00:59.020
(Seong Jae is wearing white too.)

22
00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.659
- Seong Jae... - Are you all wearing matching?

23
00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:02.590
- You're all... - What's going on?

24
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.600
- I'm all alone. - No.

25
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.969
- Come in. - Your outfit isn't meant for Inje.

26
00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.700
- You're all... - Look.

27
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.099
(Chelsea boots, ragged jeans,)

28
00:01:12.099 --> 00:01:13.269
(leather jacket)

29
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.209
It looks like Se Hyeong and Boys.

30
00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:17.239
(Yang Se Hyeong and Boys)

31
00:01:17.239 --> 00:01:18.239
It looks like...

32
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:19.810
(I'm Leader Yang.)

33
00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.980
Is there a celebrity who resides in Inje, Gangwon Province?

34
00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.250
(Is there a celebrity who resides in Inje, Gangwon Province?)

35
00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:27.189
It's going to be crazy to go...

36
00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:28.819
to the broadcasting station from here.

37
00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:31.219
I think the person who lives here...

38
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.090
- stopped broadcasting. - I know.

39
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.260
(They have to cross the mountains and water...)

40
00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
(to meet the master.)

41
00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:40.799
By the way, the poem...

42
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.500
The master sent us the poem he wrote herself.

43
00:01:44.739 --> 00:01:48.170
The third master we're going to meet...

44
00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:50.840
gave us a mission to bring.

45
00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.650
Everyone must have a poem in their hearts.

46
00:01:56.019 --> 00:01:58.319
(The master's handwriting.)

47
00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:01.390
He told us to memorize...

48
00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.890
(Memorize one of your favorite poems.)

49
00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:03.890
One of our favorite poems.

50
00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:07.290
I do like poems, but I don't memorize them.

51
00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:10.799
What is my favorite poem?

52
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.069
I come to this library all the time.

53
00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.539
(Visiting the library is my life. A poem is nothing.)

54
00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:20.810
- Let's do it. Standby. - I...

55
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:21.810
Okay.

56
00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.139
(He's flustered.)

57
00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:24.340
My lie is exposed.

58
00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.439
(This is actually a drama shooting studio.)

59
00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:26.449
Which one should I pick?

60
00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:28.550
(Searching for a poetry among shooting props)

61
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.219
It has to be something I understand, right?

62
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.650
I can't just memorize it.

63
00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:38.490
Crazy. Crazy. Everyone is crazy.

64
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.990
But...

65
00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:41.960
I'm going crazy.

66
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.030
I trust my body and soul to this headphone.

67
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.370
(They're going crazy with the master's assignment.)

68
00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.569
Music is the only drug the country allows.

69
00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:54.210
(Poems they prepared by selling their souls are coming soon.)

70
00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.180
When I was told to memorize a poem,

71
00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.919
I thought it might be Lee Oi Soo since it's Gangwon Province.

72
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.020
I know.

73
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.689
- But... - If it's really Lee Oi Soo...

74
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.889
I have something to say. I've read his book, "Haak Haak".

75
00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:16.300
I think I'm the one who met Lee Oi Soo most recently.

76
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:17.930
(Really?)

77
00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.099
- Where? - When I was in the army...

78
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.469
(Reading his face)

79
00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:26.240
I went to a field trip to Hwacheon with the army.

80
00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.710
- Look at his face. - At the Gamseong village,

81
00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:31.409
I've listened to his lecture.

82
00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:33.280
Are you talking about your military life again even at 7am?

83
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.150
I had no choice.

84
00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:39.120
Did you bring something in your bag?

85
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.389
This one?

86
00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:43.259
(Did Seung Gi, who is thorough, bring a special bag again?)

87
00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:46.530
It looks quite heavy.

88
00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.659
We always pick a person to have him sleep with our master.

89
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.569
At that time when we were with Master Jeon In Kwon,

90
00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.969
he was sleeping without changing his outfit and removing his sunglasses.

91
00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:01.370
I was afraid his temple could be hurt.

92
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.879
So, I brought something for the one who gets to sleep with the master.

93
00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.610
It's pajamas for a couple.

94
00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:10.849
(Couple pajamas?)

95
00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:16.860
Wearing pajamas can raise deeper fellowship with the master.

96
00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.919
(To build fellowship,)

97
00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:23.259
(should I wear the same pajama with the master?)

98
00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:25.000
Does that mean you're going to sleep with the master?

99
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.699
No. I brought the pajamas in your size.

100
00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:30.199
It perfectly fits for you. I'll show you.

101
00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:31.639
Look how it's like.

102
00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:33.810
- It's really a pajama. - It looks cute.

103
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.769
The size is for Seong Jae.

104
00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.209
It fits well with Seong Jae.

105
00:04:39.079 --> 00:04:40.310
I think the size is for Se Hyeong.

106
00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.319
Hold on. What's this?

107
00:04:45.079 --> 00:04:46.420
Tell me what it is.

108
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.920
I prepared this just in case when the master is a lady.

109
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.189
- And there's one more for men. - Of course.

110
00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:54.389
But, I think today's master can be a lady.

111
00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.160
We had two male masters.

112
00:04:57.699 --> 00:04:59.370
(The formula of master's analysis)

113
00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.470
I think it's a good idea for sleeping together with our master.

114
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.540
And I want to suggest something to add more.

115
00:05:06.769 --> 00:05:08.970
You need to wash anyway before you go to sleep.

116
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.540
It's not fun to just wash yourself.

117
00:05:10.709 --> 00:05:11.740
How about washing each other?

118
00:05:14.649 --> 00:05:17.279
(Startled, Washing each other?)

119
00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:19.250
(Embarrassed, That's... kind of...)

120
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.819
That's like footbath.

121
00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:24.490
I think it'd be good.

122
00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.029
Footbath! Before you mentioned footbath,

123
00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:28.930
I thought about washing each other's body.

124
00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.800
That's not what I thought.

125
00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:32.629
Do you know how embarrassing it is?

126
00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:34.670
It's embarrassing, but you can get close each other.

127
00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.170
- I assure you. - But...

128
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.899
Think what footbath is like.

129
00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:40.610
Let's say I need to wash the master's feet.

130
00:05:40.769 --> 00:05:44.209
Should I clean everywhere such as between toes?

131
00:05:44.209 --> 00:05:45.910
Or should I clean them as if I'm doing a foot massage?

132
00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.149
You should put your fingers between toes like this.

133
00:05:47.149 --> 00:05:48.449
Toes look like this.

134
00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:50.949
- Should I clean even here? - Look.

135
00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.550
First, massage the foot like this.

136
00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:55.819
Then, you should put your fingers between toes and do like this.

137
00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.259
So, I told you it's kind of weird.

138
00:05:58.259 --> 00:05:59.629
I have some dead skins around here.

139
00:05:59.629 --> 00:06:01.529
But you need to do it.

140
00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:02.959
And massage the foot everywhere.

141
00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:06.430
(It's kind of embarrassing even to imagine.)

142
00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:07.829
It's getting harder.

143
00:06:07.899 --> 00:06:09.230
I think we'll get too close to the master.

144
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.199
It'll be good. But, I won't do this.

145
00:06:11.769 --> 00:06:12.970
I won't either.

146
00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:14.910
Only one person gets to do this, right?

147
00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:16.879
- It's okay if it's not my job. - Anyone is okay except me.

148
00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:18.040
- Then, I have one more. - Yes?

149
00:06:18.579 --> 00:06:19.680
In the master's ear,

150
00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.680
(In the master's ear...)

151
00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.720
how about singing him a lullaby?

152
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.420
The pupil is doing it for the master, right?

153
00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:29.990
It's fine as long as it's not my job.

154
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.889
I can't wait for the sleeping with the master today.

155
00:06:31.959 --> 00:06:34.290
Anybody who gets to sleep with the master is doomed.

156
00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:35.990
(Couple pajamas, footbath, and even lullaby)

157
00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:38.199
- Oh gosh. - I'm fully awaken now.

158
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.699
The master who will be with you today...

159
00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.500
just finished his schedule in Pyeongchang.

160
00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.370
And he's coming here to meet you.

161
00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:47.970
Then...

162
00:06:48.209 --> 00:06:49.839
In that case, I guess...

163
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:54.850
Pyeongchang Olympic is a national event now.

164
00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.550
The master can be a famous one who's promoting the Olympic.

165
00:06:58.620 --> 00:06:59.990
It can be Kim Yuna.

166
00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:03.319
The compact venue plan of Pyeongchang 2018.

167
00:07:05.319 --> 00:07:07.290
I mean here might not be the base camp.

168
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:10.230
(Smiling even by imagining it)

169
00:07:10.399 --> 00:07:13.170
- Kim Yuna... - Let's say if she comes here.

170
00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:14.430
Can you do all the things we've said?

171
00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:16.699
Let's say Kim Yuna is here.

172
00:07:16.769 --> 00:07:17.970
Can you do those things?

173
00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:22.240
- First, the pajamas sound good. - You're okay with pajamas.

174
00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:24.980
- Let's say Kim Yuna is our master. - I can wear pajamas.

175
00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.209
- Footbath? I think... - About the footbath...

176
00:07:27.209 --> 00:07:29.079
- she might kick you. - It's too much.

177
00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.279
I think I can sing a lullaby.

178
00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:32.350
In her ear?

179
00:07:32.949 --> 00:07:36.389
You know I've met Yuna several times for work.

180
00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:37.790
I've seen her before too!

181
00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:39.930
- How many times? - Once!

182
00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:41.930
- I've seen her a lot. - It's not only you who met her.

183
00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:43.329
I've met her six times.

184
00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:44.600
Have you seen her before?

185
00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.170
- I've never seen her. - Have you seen her before?

186
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:47.430
I've met her in person.

187
00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:49.540
(I've met her in person.)

188
00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:50.540
- What? - Gosh.

189
00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:52.370
(You mean our Goddess Yuna?)

190
00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:54.110
I don't like those kinds of people.

191
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:55.810
He didn't say anything until now and told us he's met her in person.

192
00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:57.209
He has to do with a lot more than we think.

193
00:07:57.209 --> 00:07:58.779
How come did you meet her privately?

194
00:07:58.779 --> 00:07:59.810
Well...

195
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:03.519
I was with my acquaintances in a cafe before.

196
00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:05.680
(One of the acquaintances are...)

197
00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.149
(Kim Yuna?)

198
00:08:07.149 --> 00:08:08.649
She came in as if she has an appointment.

199
00:08:11.519 --> 00:08:12.519
(I see.)

200
00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:14.589
And she just passed by.

201
00:08:14.589 --> 00:08:16.300
I thought you actually met her.

202
00:08:16.829 --> 00:08:19.000
When you say you meet someone in person,

203
00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:21.000
it means that you had a conversation in the same table.

204
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.269
But you two met her while you were doing your work.

205
00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:28.040
And I met her in person.

206
00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.810
I think he has...

207
00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.410
- a very different thinking. - As an elite, he's persuasive.

208
00:08:33.449 --> 00:08:34.480
He actually saw her in person then.

209
00:08:34.709 --> 00:08:36.120
(Am I not right?)

210
00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.580
- From Seong Jae... - The schedule...

211
00:08:39.389 --> 00:08:41.220
I hope there's skating.

212
00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:42.289
I'll open the schedule.

213
00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:43.320
1, 2, 3...

214
00:08:44.659 --> 00:08:45.690
Why does it look so simple?

215
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:47.759
(The master's schedule)

216
00:08:47.759 --> 00:08:49.759
(Thinking, With romance, With nature and pals, Cardio)

217
00:08:49.759 --> 00:08:51.230
How many hours does the master sleep?

218
00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.899
- This looks so great. - I know.

219
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:55.230
Superb.

220
00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:57.470
(Scanning)

221
00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:59.200
- Nice! Nice! - What is it?

222
00:09:01.639 --> 00:09:03.179
You like it because there's no workout time.

223
00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:06.679
I think that "With romance" part must be related to poetry.

224
00:09:06.809 --> 00:09:08.950
- Maybe it's about reading. - It can be about reading.

225
00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:10.950
- Or it can be about writing. - Writing, right.

226
00:09:12.379 --> 00:09:15.720
Then, I'll give you the second hint about the master.

227
00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:16.720
- Okay. - Yes. Good.

228
00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.659
You can make a call with this number.

229
00:09:19.659 --> 00:09:20.659
(The second hint, calling the master's acquaintance)

230
00:09:21.389 --> 00:09:22.490
I'm nervous.

231
00:09:24.399 --> 00:09:26.169
Call after thinking about what you want to ask.

232
00:09:26.169 --> 00:09:27.470
- Hang it up. - I hung up.

233
00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:28.570
I hung up.

234
00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:30.070
Se Hyeong, you should've told me sooner.

235
00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:31.139
You should've thought about what to ask first.

236
00:09:31.139 --> 00:09:32.809
- You might murmur. - It'll show "Missed Call".

237
00:09:32.809 --> 00:09:33.970
- Hey... - He just called without thinking.

238
00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:36.379
To not to gibber, let's decide what you should ask.

239
00:09:36.379 --> 00:09:37.580
- First, we should... - Each of you tell us what to ask.

240
00:09:38.179 --> 00:09:39.210
Who is this?

241
00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:40.710
"Who is this?" It's the first question to ask.

242
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:43.179
- Occupation. - You'll ask that question first.

243
00:09:43.179 --> 00:09:44.480
Ask if the master is a celebrity or not...

244
00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.450
Then, I'll ask what the master would think of the couple pajamas.

245
00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.820
You mean what kind of reactions the master would show?

246
00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:51.690
And we can ask about footbath as well.

247
00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:54.330
Then, I'll call the number.

248
00:09:55.159 --> 00:09:56.200
I'll go.

249
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.200
Who is going to greet?

250
00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.230
Seung Gi...

251
00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:03.169
- Hello. - Hello.

252
00:10:03.639 --> 00:10:06.570
- Hello. - We're from All the Butlers.

253
00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:07.669
(Who is going to be?)

254
00:10:07.669 --> 00:10:09.580
- Hello. - Hello.

255
00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:11.509
(We don't know who you are.)

256
00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:13.779
Hello.

257
00:10:13.909 --> 00:10:15.350
How have you been?

258
00:10:15.679 --> 00:10:17.350
- I'm good. - I enjoyed your show.

259
00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:20.090
Thank you for getting a phone call in this early morning.

260
00:10:20.289 --> 00:10:22.720
You work so hard in this early hour.

261
00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.019
It's not a problem.

262
00:10:24.019 --> 00:10:26.190
Can you tell me what relationship you have with the master?

263
00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:30.259
So many things that he has been doing...

264
00:10:30.259 --> 00:10:32.129
are what I admire. Well...

265
00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:33.269
- It is... - Who must it be?

266
00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:35.970
- His voice is young. - I actually have no...

267
00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:38.570
personal relationship with him.

268
00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:41.210
Your voice sounds like Taeyang in Big Bang.

269
00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:43.279
(Your voice sounds like Taeyang in Big Bang.)

270
00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:44.740
(The world star, Taeyang in Big Bang)

271
00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:47.450
(is the person who they're calling with?)

272
00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:50.120
Oh, you're right.

273
00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:54.049
(New bridegroom, Taeyang!)

274
00:10:54.889 --> 00:10:56.720
(It's amazing that it's Taeyang, but that Seung Gi got it right.)

275
00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.419
How did you know it right away?

276
00:10:58.419 --> 00:10:59.730
How did you find it out?

277
00:11:00.559 --> 00:11:02.190
(I'm amazed as well.)

278
00:11:03.259 --> 00:11:05.659
- Thank you at this hour of morning. - I know.

279
00:11:05.659 --> 00:11:07.429
- Hello. - My goodness.

280
00:11:07.669 --> 00:11:09.970
- How can it be you? - When you think of the master,

281
00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:12.100
which part of the master inspire you most?

282
00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:13.809
What makes you that you want to meet him?

283
00:11:15.009 --> 00:11:17.309
In fact,

284
00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:19.980
there's not a lot of people...

285
00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:22.049
- who I envy. - I see.

286
00:11:22.279 --> 00:11:23.580
- But he envies this person. - Who is it?

287
00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:25.980
- You're cool. - He's one of the people...

288
00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.519
I envy most.

289
00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:31.889
Have you ever met him before?

290
00:11:32.519 --> 00:11:34.889
I've always wanted to meet him before.

291
00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:37.730
So, I looked for a chance.

292
00:11:38.399 --> 00:11:41.570
But I've never found a chance to meet him at all.

293
00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:45.870
The person that Taeyang in Big Bang,

294
00:11:46.409 --> 00:11:48.139
the world star, can't meet...

295
00:11:48.139 --> 00:11:49.139
(Who Taeyang, the world star, longs for meeting)

296
00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:50.580
(The star of stars)

297
00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:53.750
(Who are you, Master?)

298
00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:58.980
Do you know what we should keep in mind before we meet him?

299
00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:00.690
Well...

300
00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:04.820
Since I've never had any personal relationship before,

301
00:12:05.389 --> 00:12:06.629
I have no idea.

302
00:12:07.389 --> 00:12:10.460
We thank you that you received a call at this early hour.

303
00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:12.000
But, we need to get a hint.

304
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:13.799
Because you didn't give any...

305
00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.639
Then, I wonder why you woke up so early.

306
00:12:16.639 --> 00:12:18.600
(Why did you wake up so early?)

307
00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:22.909
- Well... - You just kept saying you envy him.

308
00:12:22.909 --> 00:12:24.809
Then, how about coming here to join us?

309
00:12:27.779 --> 00:12:29.720
About him,

310
00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.350
I'll give you one more hint.

311
00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:34.950
For a long time,

312
00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:39.159
he used to be called National Blah Blah Blah.

313
00:12:39.159 --> 00:12:40.259
- National Blah Blah Blah? - Wait a moment.

314
00:12:40.259 --> 00:12:42.629
- National Blah Blah Blah? - Yes.

315
00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:44.629
You mean not just two letters. Not Blah Blah, but Blah Blah Blah?

316
00:12:45.059 --> 00:12:46.070
- Yes. - Three letters?

317
00:12:46.299 --> 00:12:47.470
Three letters.

318
00:12:47.629 --> 00:12:49.600
When we say there's "National" in the nickname,

319
00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:52.139
- Olympic. - It means someone on the top.

320
00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:53.769
- It's Kim Yuna. - National Younger Sister.

321
00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:55.070
National Younger Sister!

322
00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:58.909
I think this person is the first to have a nickname...

323
00:12:58.909 --> 00:13:00.809
with "National".

324
00:13:00.809 --> 00:13:02.110
National Younger Sister, Moon Geun Young.

325
00:13:03.779 --> 00:13:05.779
National Younger Sister... He's the pioneer...

326
00:13:05.779 --> 00:13:07.389
of national something.

327
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:08.750
Yes. Of course.

328
00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:13.059
We are going to go and meet the master.

329
00:13:13.059 --> 00:13:14.929
Do you want us...

330
00:13:14.929 --> 00:13:16.230
to say anything to him on your behalf?

331
00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:21.700
- I am joining the army soon. - Right.

332
00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:23.799
- You're joining the army. - Yes.

333
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.269
- Please don't mention the army. - Taeyang,

334
00:13:25.269 --> 00:13:27.539
- call me whenever it gets tough. - I...

335
00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:30.210
Tell me if there is anything I can help.

336
00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:32.080
- Okay. I will. - I know about the army.

337
00:13:32.779 --> 00:13:34.179
- He knows about the army. - I know about the army.

338
00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:38.279
I feel a special connection because you're soon joining the army.

339
00:13:39.179 --> 00:13:41.320
(He sighs.)

340
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:44.120
It won't be too difficult, so cheer up.

341
00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.559
- I will. - My goodness.

342
00:13:45.559 --> 00:13:46.789
You are great.

343
00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:48.889
I feel proud of you.

344
00:13:48.889 --> 00:13:50.759
Taeyang,

345
00:13:50.929 --> 00:13:52.629
don't make any memories in the army.

346
00:13:54.629 --> 00:13:56.269
- I beg you. - No.

347
00:13:56.669 --> 00:13:58.370
You will understand me when you finish the service.

348
00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:01.370
- Anyway... - Thank you for talking to us.

349
00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:02.809
- Yes, Taeyang. - Thank you.

350
00:14:02.879 --> 00:14:04.139
- Have a good day. - You too.

351
00:14:04.139 --> 00:14:05.139
Bye.

352
00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:08.809
Now, you can go find the master.

353
00:14:08.879 --> 00:14:10.279
I just hope he's not in the mountains.

354
00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:12.649
Who is today's master?

355
00:14:17.389 --> 00:14:19.090
What? He's in the mountains too.

356
00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.289
It's a birch forest.

357
00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:24.000
- This... - Here.

358
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.799
(The master is waiting inside the birch forest.)

359
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.570
- Let's go. - Let's go.

360
00:14:27.769 --> 00:14:29.200
- Let's go. - Let's go.

361
00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.440
(With Romance)

362
00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:33.970
(Today's master...)

363
00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:36.340
(enjoys romance in the mountains.)

364
00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:39.649
When you think of hiking,

365
00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:43.080
people think of hiking...

366
00:14:43.149 --> 00:14:46.049
in spring or autumn.

367
00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:48.389
But the real hikers hike...

368
00:14:48.389 --> 00:14:51.220
- in winter. It's the prettiest. - They hike in the winter.

369
00:14:51.759 --> 00:14:52.789
It's the most beautiful time.

370
00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:54.690
- At night... - Look.

371
00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:55.789
(No way.)

372
00:14:55.789 --> 00:14:56.830
This is unbelievable.

373
00:14:57.399 --> 00:14:59.059
- I got so shocked. - What is that?

374
00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:00.730
- It's so beautiful. - My goodness.

375
00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:04.000
This is unbelievable.

376
00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:07.269
This looks like a different place, doesn't it?

377
00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:08.909
It's really beautiful.

378
00:15:08.909 --> 00:15:10.809
Aren't you curious about today's master?

379
00:15:10.809 --> 00:15:12.210
I am so curious to find out.

380
00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:13.850
- I... - What is he famous for?

381
00:15:14.179 --> 00:15:17.120
I can think of...

382
00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.720
one person. I think it's him.

383
00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:19.919
- I think it's him. - Who is it?

384
00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:22.120
- Who is it? Why not? - I can't tell you.

385
00:15:22.389 --> 00:15:23.860
I will keep it to myself.

386
00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:25.460
(He wants to keep it to himself.)

387
00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:28.129
(Does he really know?)

388
00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.659
- Should we ask them to tell us? - What?

389
00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.100
Then let's do this.

390
00:15:32.299 --> 00:15:34.570
Go to them...

391
00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.899
and whisper the name. "It's Jeon In Kwon."

392
00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:39.370
If they say you got it, you pass.

393
00:15:39.809 --> 00:15:41.110
If you are wrong...

394
00:15:41.669 --> 00:15:44.679
(What happens if they say the wrong answer?)

395
00:15:44.679 --> 00:15:46.210
Then we will put snow inside your clothes.

396
00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:47.850
- Inside our clothes? - Yes.

397
00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:49.580
You have to endure it.

398
00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:50.950
You have to stretch your arms like this.

399
00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:52.990
The snow in the mountains is as good as medicine.

400
00:15:53.149 --> 00:15:54.649
But Se Hyeong.

401
00:15:54.649 --> 00:15:56.259
(He already feels sick.)

402
00:15:56.259 --> 00:15:57.419
I want to...

403
00:15:57.419 --> 00:15:58.759
know who he is before I meet him.

404
00:15:58.759 --> 00:16:00.129
Of course. We all want to know.

405
00:16:00.659 --> 00:16:01.659
All right.

406
00:16:01.659 --> 00:16:03.730
(Confident about his answer, Se Hyeong gives the first try.)

407
00:16:05.659 --> 00:16:07.370
I think the master is...

408
00:16:07.769 --> 00:16:09.000
He is really whispering.

409
00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:11.899
He spends time to find romance.

410
00:16:11.899 --> 00:16:14.309
I think he has something to do with poetry.

411
00:16:14.309 --> 00:16:15.309
(He thinks the master enjoys romance and poetry.)

412
00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:17.580
Lee Oi Soo.

413
00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:21.950
No.

414
00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:25.250
(Se Hyeong made a wrong guess.)

415
00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:27.220
(Se Hyeong's camera)

416
00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:28.690
(I was so sure.)

417
00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:30.559
Come here. Come here.

418
00:16:32.289 --> 00:16:34.429
I already feel cold. No!

419
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:38.529
(As soon as he gets wrong, they collect snow.)

420
00:16:38.529 --> 00:16:40.570
- This is crazy. - You can't talk now.

421
00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:42.840
- What is that? - Please grab him from that side.

422
00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:44.169
I want you to take off...

423
00:16:44.169 --> 00:16:45.600
- the winter jacket. - You know it, right?

424
00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:46.970
I'm very tough when it comes to these things.

425
00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:48.409
We know.

426
00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:50.179
I am tough,

427
00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.039
so I won't scream like crazy to make people laugh.

428
00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:53.679
(But it's already funny.)

429
00:16:53.679 --> 00:16:54.809
All right.

430
00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:56.350
- Ready and go. - Please insert snow.

431
00:16:57.149 --> 00:16:58.179
Ready and go.

432
00:16:59.549 --> 00:17:02.289
(He slowly puts snow inside Se Hyeong's shirt.)

433
00:17:02.289 --> 00:17:03.960
(He continues.)

434
00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:04.990
Is it going in?

435
00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:06.889
Seong Jae is brutal.

436
00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:08.929
- He's so slow. - Just put everything.

437
00:17:08.929 --> 00:17:10.930
(He remains very calm.)

438
00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:12.599
He's enduring very well.

439
00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:14.730
(His shirt is filled with ice.)

440
00:17:20.569 --> 00:17:22.910
(It becomes unbearable.)

441
00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.950
(Laughing hysterically)

442
00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.789
Get it out. Get it out.

443
00:17:32.849 --> 00:17:34.549
- Where is it? - It's gone.

444
00:17:34.619 --> 00:17:36.519
The snow is gone, but he says it's cold.

445
00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:39.119
- You guys are... - Is it really cold?

446
00:17:39.119 --> 00:17:40.630
- Hey. - It must be unbelievably cold.

447
00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:43.359
- It wouldn't be just cold. - It's like poking with 100 needles.

448
00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:46.170
- That must hurt. - Gosh.

449
00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:48.400
- Whose name did you give? - What?

450
00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:49.440
I can't tell you.

451
00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.869
- Right. - You won't say that name then.

452
00:17:51.869 --> 00:17:52.869
Well, that's why you should tell me.

453
00:17:52.869 --> 00:17:54.009
Well, that's why you should tell me.

454
00:17:54.009 --> 00:17:56.039
I think about two of them will say the same person. Look.

455
00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:57.710
Who's next?

456
00:17:58.380 --> 00:17:59.750
Okay. Should I try it?

457
00:17:59.809 --> 00:18:00.809
Let's go.

458
00:18:00.809 --> 00:18:01.809
(The confident Seung Gi gives it a try.)

459
00:18:03.579 --> 00:18:05.180
I am really not sure.

460
00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:06.220
("With Romance")

461
00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:09.190
(Perhaps it's the singer who sang "About Romance".)

462
00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:10.759
Choi Baek Ho.

463
00:18:12.829 --> 00:18:15.589
(Did he get the answer?)

464
00:18:15.589 --> 00:18:16.599
No.

465
00:18:16.599 --> 00:18:18.029
(He fails.)

466
00:18:18.029 --> 00:18:19.029
(Oh, no.)

467
00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:23.700
(It's a snow festival!)

468
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.009
Come here. Come here. Hold this.

469
00:18:28.509 --> 00:18:30.579
- Wait. - I will take his jacket.

470
00:18:30.579 --> 00:18:32.579
- Do that. - Take his jacket.

471
00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:34.579
- Where will you put it? - Take it off. Take it off first.

472
00:18:34.579 --> 00:18:35.910
- Why? - Take it off.

473
00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:36.950
- Wait. I am sorry. - Why?

474
00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:38.019
I will take your scarf.

475
00:18:38.019 --> 00:18:40.549
(He kindly unwraps Seung Gi's scarf.)

476
00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:43.190
- Stay still. - Why are you so excited?

477
00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:44.690
You gave me a finger flick the other day.

478
00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:45.920
(He's still upset about Seung Gi's finger flick.)

479
00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:46.960
Hold this.

480
00:18:47.759 --> 00:18:49.460
- All right. - But I didn't...

481
00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:51.200
I will film Seung Gi. You film Se Hyeong.

482
00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.200
All right. Have a sit.

483
00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.869
How do you feel right now?

484
00:18:54.029 --> 00:18:56.700
I am used to this environment.

485
00:18:56.769 --> 00:18:58.940
- Okay. - I was trained to endure winter.

486
00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:00.569
- What face will you make? - What?

487
00:19:00.569 --> 00:19:01.609
What face will you make?

488
00:19:01.609 --> 00:19:02.609
(He's proud of himself for having been trained.)

489
00:19:07.279 --> 00:19:08.750
(Snow is the medicine to cure arrogance.)

490
00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:10.720
- Wait. - Stay still.

491
00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:11.750
Look at his face.

492
00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:14.650
(He twitches.)

493
00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:19.019
(He shivers.)

494
00:19:20.059 --> 00:19:22.589
(His face seems to have wrinkled a little.)

495
00:19:22.759 --> 00:19:24.599
- Didn't his face change? - It did.

496
00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:27.029
It's over. His face changed. Stop.

497
00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:29.740
Darn it!

498
00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:31.569
(He transforms into...)

499
00:19:31.569 --> 00:19:33.269
(a super hero.)

500
00:19:33.269 --> 00:19:36.009
(Where are you, my master?)

501
00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:39.809
(He's the new super hero, Sabu.)

502
00:19:39.809 --> 00:19:41.579
- Didn't he... - My goodness.

503
00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:43.319
Didn't he change?

504
00:19:43.319 --> 00:19:44.319
(I think new blood is flowing inside me.)

505
00:19:44.319 --> 00:19:46.289
It won't come out. It won't come out.

506
00:19:46.289 --> 00:19:48.519
Please take it out. I can't get it out.

507
00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:50.920
This is crazy.

508
00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:53.059
(The hero's blood is flowing inside him.)

509
00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:57.259
(He enter the atmosphere to meet the master in the space.)

510
00:19:58.029 --> 00:19:59.200
(Where are we?)

511
00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:01.630
Se Hyeong is thrilled.

512
00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:03.000
(The hero arrives on Planet Birch.)

513
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.140
His face changed, didn't it?

514
00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:05.369
It didn't change.

515
00:20:05.839 --> 00:20:07.069
(When a civilian...)

516
00:20:07.069 --> 00:20:08.640
(met snow...)

517
00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.109
(and suffered,)

518
00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:11.910
(he became a super hero.)

519
00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:13.309
They say you changed.

520
00:20:14.262 --> 00:20:16.733
(Super Hero on their way to meet the Master)
(Part 2 will be air shortly)

521
00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:21.500
What's that? Look at those birch trees.

522
00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:23.369
- That's amazing. - That's it.

523
00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:25.199
- That's the birch forest. - No way.

524
00:20:25.199 --> 00:20:27.369
(A white forest suddenly unfolds before their eyes.)

525
00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.609
This is stunning.

526
00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:32.310
It's so beautiful, isn't it?

527
00:20:33.379 --> 00:20:35.550
This is where photographers come.

528
00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:38.419
(It's as if someone poured white paint over the forest.)

529
00:20:38.419 --> 00:20:40.649
Is the master here?

530
00:20:40.649 --> 00:20:43.719
(The birch forest is the most beautiful in winter.)

531
00:20:43.719 --> 00:20:45.359
This is so beautiful.

532
00:20:45.359 --> 00:20:47.290
Who made those?

533
00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:52.959
(They walk in the forest...)

534
00:20:52.959 --> 00:20:57.230
(while stepping on the crisp white snow.)

535
00:20:58.669 --> 00:21:01.709
I already feel like I learned something from him.

536
00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:04.369
He led us...

537
00:21:04.939 --> 00:21:06.679
to such a beautiful place.

538
00:21:07.879 --> 00:21:09.810
(Sang Yun)

539
00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:11.949
It feels like we're abroad.

540
00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:15.419
Birch tree,

541
00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:19.290
Your beautiful form...

542
00:21:20.119 --> 00:21:21.859
and your beautiful color...

543
00:21:22.459 --> 00:21:24.429
mesmerize me.

544
00:21:24.429 --> 00:21:25.459
(The beautiful color of the birch tree inspired Se Hyeong.)

545
00:21:25.459 --> 00:21:26.899
Thank you, birch tree.

546
00:21:28.699 --> 00:21:30.600
Se Hyeong always looks mad.

547
00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:33.070
- It's so beautiful. - It's white everywhere.

548
00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:34.070
I feel like I'm transported to a different world.

549
00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:35.639
I think our faces will stand out from the forest.

550
00:21:35.869 --> 00:21:37.909
This place is unbelievable. Let's take photos.

551
00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:43.609
- It's... - It's a photo zone.

552
00:21:43.609 --> 00:21:48.449
(The winter forest has warmth which concrete jungle lacks.)

553
00:21:48.449 --> 00:21:49.689
This is a photo zone.

554
00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:50.750
I know.

555
00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:51.990
(The blissful scenery makes them...)

556
00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:54.459
(forget the reason why they're here.)

557
00:21:54.859 --> 00:21:56.659
- Sang Yun, let's take a photo. - Okay.

558
00:21:58.129 --> 00:21:59.629
1, 2, 3.

559
00:22:00.129 --> 00:22:01.230
(Sang Yun and Se Hyeong at a birch forest)

560
00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:02.469
Wait. Look at that.

561
00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:04.399
1, 2...

562
00:22:09.669 --> 00:22:11.639
- Isn't this too beautiful? - It is.

563
00:22:11.639 --> 00:22:15.010
- It's like a movie set. - It's like a different world.

564
00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:17.850
(It feels like they are in a different world.)

565
00:22:19.219 --> 00:22:22.689
I feel like my eyes are brightened.

566
00:22:22.689 --> 00:22:25.520
(The snow is filled with white light.)

567
00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:27.219
(The birch trees and the snow brighten each other.)

568
00:22:27.219 --> 00:22:28.230
It's so beautiful.

569
00:22:28.689 --> 00:22:30.689
Look at the color of the trees and the snow.

570
00:22:30.689 --> 00:22:32.500
(The birch trees and the snow shine bright.)

571
00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:37.330
We're in the forest, but it feels brighter.

572
00:22:39.169 --> 00:22:42.169
I think the master is a romantic.

573
00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:44.310
That's why he brought us here.

574
00:22:44.369 --> 00:22:45.609
This is unbelievable.

575
00:22:45.879 --> 00:22:49.109
I think Seong Jae's sentimentality will suit him well.

576
00:22:49.609 --> 00:22:51.949
If it weren't for him, we wouldn't have come here.

577
00:22:51.949 --> 00:22:55.320
I know. I only heard the word "national".

578
00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:57.090
He is not a national singer, so he's national something.

579
00:22:57.490 --> 00:22:59.090
National mountain spirit?

580
00:23:00.219 --> 00:23:01.260
National mountain spirit?

581
00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:05.060
- National mountain spirit? - Is there such a thing?

582
00:23:05.959 --> 00:23:07.300
Is there such thing as a national mountain spirit?

583
00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:08.830
I've never heard of it.

584
00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.570
Is it perhaps someone who is considered everyone's little sister?

585
00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:14.270
(He speaks of his wish.)

586
00:23:14.469 --> 00:23:17.840
(He remembers Master Jeon In Kwon and Master Lee Dae Ho.)

587
00:23:17.909 --> 00:23:21.709
(Will we finally meet a romantic master?)

588
00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:25.179
It would be amazing if she is Kim Yuna.

589
00:23:25.179 --> 00:23:27.649
(What if it's Kim Yuna, the national figure skater?)

590
00:23:27.919 --> 00:23:31.719
(Is it her, who suits white snow better than anyone?)

591
00:23:33.119 --> 00:23:35.230
(No way.)

592
00:23:35.959 --> 00:23:37.790
(Is this Winter Olympics special?)

593
00:23:39.459 --> 00:23:43.369
(Who will welcome them with a lovely fairy smile?)

594
00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:49.609
(Who is this silver fairy...)

595
00:23:49.609 --> 00:23:51.639
(in the birch forest?)

596
00:23:52.679 --> 00:23:55.649
(Who is their romantic master with shining silver hair,)

597
00:23:55.649 --> 00:23:58.419
(who strolled around the forest...)

598
00:23:58.419 --> 00:24:01.719
(waiting for his pupils?)

599
00:24:01.719 --> 00:24:04.859
You should only stare at the front from now on.

600
00:24:05.189 --> 00:24:06.719
He must be coming now.

601
00:24:06.889 --> 00:24:08.159
You want us to stare at the front.

602
00:24:08.859 --> 00:24:10.429
(Why are they not allowed to turn back?)

603
00:24:10.429 --> 00:24:11.429
I am nervous.

604
00:24:11.429 --> 00:24:12.530
(They are excited and nervous.)

605
00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:14.699
Isn't it like that?

606
00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:17.100
It's like that show where a man and woman go on a date...

607
00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:18.869
- "Mountain Cabin Blind Date"? - and then make a decision later on.

608
00:24:18.869 --> 00:24:20.800
- "Mountain Cabin Blind Date"? - Something like that.

609
00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:24.439
Will he stand behind the person he likes?

610
00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:28.449
It will be amazing if it's Kim Yuna.

611
00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:30.879
I can't wait to turn around now that you've banned it.

612
00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:33.050
Perhaps it's Moon Geun Young.

613
00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:36.090
I've never met one of those so-called "nation's little sisters".

614
00:24:38.719 --> 00:24:41.359
When will he come?

615
00:24:41.359 --> 00:24:43.030
I am afraid that he's going to attack us from behind.

616
00:24:43.859 --> 00:24:46.100
- I am scared. - When will he come?

617
00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:48.270
(The master's footsteps will kill their excitements.)

618
00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:49.669
Is he here?

619
00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:51.199
- I am nervous. - He's a national something.

620
00:24:51.639 --> 00:24:53.939
- That's your master. - How long will he take?

621
00:24:54.439 --> 00:24:55.810
(They have no idea who their master is.)

622
00:24:55.810 --> 00:24:56.810
They don't see him yet.

623
00:24:57.639 --> 00:24:59.510
- You don't see him yet? - Is he here?

624
00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:01.609
- Is he here? - I can't see what's behind.

625
00:25:01.609 --> 00:25:03.810
Is he near enough to hear us?

626
00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:07.149
- Is he? - I am scared.

627
00:25:07.149 --> 00:25:09.189
(The sound of his breaths near, and they become nervous.)

628
00:25:09.189 --> 00:25:10.790
I heard a woman's voice.

629
00:25:11.959 --> 00:25:12.959
It's...

630
00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:17.060
(They desperately waited for him.)

631
00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:18.659
- He's here. - I can't wait.

632
00:25:18.659 --> 00:25:20.230
(He's the 3rd master of All the Butlers.)

633
00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:21.800
Sir!

634
00:25:21.869 --> 00:25:24.199
- Seung Gi. - My goodness.

635
00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:26.240
- Hello, sir. - Hello.

636
00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:27.969
(The master's appearance turns excitement into shock.)

637
00:25:27.969 --> 00:25:28.969
Hello, sir.

638
00:25:34.709 --> 00:25:37.879
(The romantic master is Choi Bool Am.)

639
00:25:38.149 --> 00:25:40.379
- Hello, sir. - Hello.

640
00:25:40.379 --> 00:25:42.189
- Hello. - You've come a long way.

641
00:25:42.189 --> 00:25:43.219
Hello, master.

642
00:25:43.219 --> 00:25:45.659
("Country Diaries")

643
00:25:45.659 --> 00:25:47.119
(Father, Choi Bool Am)

644
00:25:47.689 --> 00:25:50.490
(He was on "Country Diaries" for 22 years.)

645
00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:53.760
(He was on "Chief Inspector" for 18 years.)

646
00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:59.840
(He's the legend of family drama.)

647
00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:03.869
(He represents long-running dramas.)

648
00:26:03.869 --> 00:26:05.409
You're talking nonsense.

649
00:26:05.409 --> 00:26:06.540
(He laughed...)

650
00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:08.609
(and cried...)

651
00:26:08.609 --> 00:26:11.679
(with the entire nation.)

652
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:14.550
(He's the nation's father figure, Choi Bool Am.)

653
00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:19.320
(A romantic day with him begins now.)

654
00:26:19.689 --> 00:26:21.090
- Hello. - Hello, sir.

655
00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:22.689
- Hello. - You've come a long way.

656
00:26:22.689 --> 00:26:24.830
- Hello. - My goodness.

657
00:26:25.359 --> 00:26:26.830
- It's nice to meet you. - You are the youngest, right?

658
00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:27.929
- Yes. - Hello, I am Yang Se Hyeong.

659
00:26:28.169 --> 00:26:29.929
- Se Hyeong. - Yes.

660
00:26:30.369 --> 00:26:33.740
- It was him. - My name is Lee Sang Yun.

661
00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:36.340
It's nice to meet you. Thank you for coming out here.

662
00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:38.340
- No problem, sir. - It's nice to meet you.

663
00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:39.980
I can't believe we met here.

664
00:26:40.679 --> 00:26:42.209
None of you has done a show with me, right?

665
00:26:42.209 --> 00:26:43.250
- No. - No.

666
00:26:43.879 --> 00:26:46.080
But I've seen a lot of your shows.

667
00:26:46.679 --> 00:26:48.290
What did you see?

668
00:26:49.149 --> 00:26:52.090
Isn't "Korean Food Table" the only thing you saw?

669
00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:53.560
I've seen that a lot too.

670
00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:56.429
- We will greet you in our way. - All right.

671
00:26:56.790 --> 00:26:58.330
It's very nice to meet you, sir.

672
00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.659
- We are All the Butlers. - We are All the Butlers.

673
00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:03.429
Thank you.

674
00:27:03.429 --> 00:27:04.899
I didn't expect that.

675
00:27:04.899 --> 00:27:08.570
(They bow.)

676
00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:10.510
I have to bow too.

677
00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:11.510
No.

678
00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:13.080
(His presence makes them bow down.)

679
00:27:13.879 --> 00:27:15.409
My goodness.

680
00:27:16.149 --> 00:27:20.550
I never thought I'd have the chance to meet Mr. Choi.

681
00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:24.320
Do you live around here?

682
00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:26.020
- Or do you often come here? - I don't live here.

683
00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:28.859
We shot "Korean Food Table" in Pyeongchang.

684
00:27:28.929 --> 00:27:31.699
I spent another night there for this show.

685
00:27:32.399 --> 00:27:34.230
Then I moved here this morning.

686
00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:36.530
- That's why... - Do you not come here often?

687
00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:37.929
(Why did he choose to come to the birch forest in Inje?)

688
00:27:37.929 --> 00:27:39.800
I've been yearning to see this forest.

689
00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:41.939
I've been wanting to see this birch forest.

690
00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:47.040
Look at them. They look as if all their eyes and mouths are open.

691
00:27:49.179 --> 00:27:50.550
(Eyes?)

692
00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:51.750
(Mouths?)

693
00:27:55.389 --> 00:27:56.889
(After hearing that, they finally see the eyes.)

694
00:27:56.889 --> 00:27:59.889
- Those? - They do look like eyes.

695
00:27:59.889 --> 00:28:02.689
- Don't they look like eyes? - They look like eyes.

696
00:28:03.929 --> 00:28:04.959
They...

697
00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:08.129
You can't hide your feelings here.

698
00:28:08.899 --> 00:28:10.100
All the eyes are watching you.

699
00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:11.300
(You can't hide your feelings because you're being watched.)

700
00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:14.669
Say hello to the birches. They grant all your wishes.

701
00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:20.010
Everything you say sounds so poetic.

702
00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:21.480
(His words contain romance.)

703
00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:24.480
- Let's go around the forest once... - Yes.

704
00:28:24.649 --> 00:28:27.320
and think of a poem in your heart.

705
00:28:28.149 --> 00:28:31.619
(A poem?)

706
00:28:33.189 --> 00:28:38.629
(Think of a poem in your heart.)

707
00:28:45.169 --> 00:28:49.270
(They can't understand his intention clearly,)

708
00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:52.340
(but they slowly tune into...)

709
00:28:52.409 --> 00:28:57.109
(the master's sentiments.)

710
00:29:00.149 --> 00:29:03.590
(Before they started walking with the master,)

711
00:29:03.719 --> 00:29:07.419
(it was just a white forest that looks good in photos.)

712
00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:14.770
(But thanks to the master's story, they think of different thoughts.)

713
00:29:19.639 --> 00:29:21.139
I realized this just now.

714
00:29:21.609 --> 00:29:25.740
When the birch trees are in a big group,

715
00:29:26.639 --> 00:29:27.639
they look like baby's breath.

716
00:29:28.909 --> 00:29:31.419
Baby's breath is beautiful when there's a bunch of it.

717
00:29:31.419 --> 00:29:32.480
It's like baby's breath.

718
00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.649
It's as if a fairy made us small,

719
00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:38.020
and we went inside...

720
00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:40.919
- a bundle of baby's breath. - Right.

721
00:29:40.919 --> 00:29:44.159
We can imagine that we are inside the bundle of baby's breath.

722
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:46.060
- That's how it really feels. - Now that you've said that,

723
00:29:46.159 --> 00:29:49.000
I feel like I smell the baby's breath.

724
00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:51.770
- I can imagine it. - You've gone too far.

725
00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:54.240
(He keeps Se Hyeong in check.)

726
00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:55.840
You are precisely right.

727
00:29:55.909 --> 00:29:56.939
Right?

728
00:29:57.139 --> 00:29:58.209
Right.

729
00:29:59.109 --> 00:30:00.280
Yes. It's nice...

730
00:30:01.139 --> 00:30:02.379
that he's very expressive.

731
00:30:02.379 --> 00:30:05.080
(Seong Jae stares at the trees for a while.)

732
00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:09.250
I think the birch trees are...

733
00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:13.790
like icicles growing upwards.

734
00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:16.590
(The birch trees are icicles that grow upwards.)

735
00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:18.230
I love that expression.

736
00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:21.570
They're like icicles grown upwards.

737
00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:22.869
That's a nice way to put it.

738
00:30:23.899 --> 00:30:27.199
It's as if all the snow is...

739
00:30:27.570 --> 00:30:30.340
trying to get back to the sky.

740
00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:33.639
You should stand next to him.

741
00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:34.810
We should change positions.

742
00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:36.209
(The master loves Seong Jae's expressions.)

743
00:30:36.209 --> 00:30:39.080
His expressions are varied and lovely.

744
00:30:39.149 --> 00:30:41.149
Let's go down now. Enough of staring at the sky.

745
00:30:41.149 --> 00:30:42.149
(Seong Jae is a little closer to becoming the master's favorite.)

746
00:30:42.149 --> 00:30:44.149
What did you just say about the snow?

747
00:30:44.419 --> 00:30:45.419
(I should say something too.)

748
00:30:45.419 --> 00:30:47.659
- It sounds nice. - Icicles that have grown upwards.

749
00:30:47.719 --> 00:30:50.530
The trees look as if...

750
00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:52.800
they've come up with rules of their own as...

751
00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:54.830
to not become nuisances to each other.

752
00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:58.169
I think they grew only within the space they're allocated.

753
00:30:58.169 --> 00:31:00.070
That's how they are planted.

754
00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:02.169
(The master teaches him the truth.)

755
00:31:02.169 --> 00:31:03.270
(He's lost.)

756
00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:04.270
Like that.

757
00:31:04.570 --> 00:31:05.679
Let's go.

758
00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:10.209
It's not going well at all.

759
00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:13.320
Seong Jae is taking away all his love for me.

760
00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:17.389
Let's try a little harder, Se Hyeong. Cheers.

761
00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:21.119
(After walking for a long while, they return to the trees.)

762
00:31:21.119 --> 00:31:24.060
Now that we've walked far enough,

763
00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:27.800
let's pray and make our wishes. Grab the tree like this.

764
00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:35.010
Will my wish come true then?

765
00:31:35.439 --> 00:31:36.469
It will grant your wish.

766
00:31:37.139 --> 00:31:38.139
- Really? - Of course.

767
00:31:38.139 --> 00:31:39.480
It just can't speak.

768
00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:44.820
So tell your wish to the tree.

769
00:31:45.050 --> 00:31:46.080
(I will do whatever the master tells me to do.)

770
00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:48.520
The tree will listen. Give it a try.

771
00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:51.419
(He sticks to the tree right away.)

772
00:31:52.689 --> 00:31:53.820
Dear birch tree.

773
00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:57.290
(He prays to the tree.)

774
00:31:57.290 --> 00:31:59.959
Thank you...

775
00:32:00.859 --> 00:32:02.899
for growing so beautifully.

776
00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:09.939
(He's not sleeping.)

777
00:32:11.109 --> 00:32:12.139
Happiness.

778
00:32:12.909 --> 00:32:14.480
Don't look elsewhere for it.

779
00:32:15.679 --> 00:32:17.480
You will find big happiness...

780
00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:19.179
in the smallest things.

781
00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:24.859
I wonder if you are listening to me.

782
00:32:26.689 --> 00:32:27.959
I wonder what you will think of me...

783
00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:29.560
I am very curious.

784
00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:34.060
Thank you for listening to me.

785
00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:37.429
Will you talk to me about yourself?

786
00:32:41.169 --> 00:32:42.369
I see.

787
00:32:42.369 --> 00:32:44.879
(He listens to the tree.)

788
00:32:44.879 --> 00:32:45.980
I see.

789
00:32:48.149 --> 00:32:49.709
Like you said...

790
00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:51.280
When looked from afar,

791
00:32:52.379 --> 00:32:53.580
- we all look like... - Your roots...

792
00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:55.419
- people who are losing their minds. - are touching,

793
00:32:57.050 --> 00:32:59.959
but you must've been lonely because you can't hug each other.

794
00:33:00.859 --> 00:33:03.030
Coming up here, I thought of many things.

795
00:33:03.030 --> 00:33:04.800
Happy New Year, dear birch tree.

796
00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:05.959
I didn't understand why...

797
00:33:05.959 --> 00:33:08.300
- I had to come up here. - I keep saying my wish to you.

798
00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:10.600
- I didn't understand it. - Dear birch tree.

799
00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:13.699
I hope you will forget about all your sorrow.

800
00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:15.340
- I love you. - I love you.

801
00:33:15.770 --> 00:33:17.740
- Let's go. - I comforted the tree.

802
00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:18.980
- Good. - Let's go.

803
00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:22.149
That's a classroom.

804
00:33:22.209 --> 00:33:24.379
- There's a classroom. - Let's take a seat there.

805
00:33:24.379 --> 00:33:26.179
(They go up to warm their bodies.)

806
00:33:27.219 --> 00:33:28.320
(Seung Gi's nose runs.)

807
00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:34.359
Seung Gi's got runny nose.

808
00:33:35.159 --> 00:33:36.689
My nose is just being respectful to the weather.

809
00:33:37.629 --> 00:33:38.629
It's winter.

810
00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.100
Master,

811
00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:44.330
I brought some warm coffee for you.

812
00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:45.639
- Did you prepare it again? - Oh, dear.

813
00:33:45.639 --> 00:33:48.070
It's insulated, so it's still hot.

814
00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:49.510
When you press the button, the lid opens right way.

815
00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:51.540
It stays really warm.

816
00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:53.409
When did you prepare this?

817
00:33:53.609 --> 00:33:54.639
I am touched.

818
00:33:54.639 --> 00:33:56.179
Do you not have any paper cups?

819
00:33:56.179 --> 00:33:58.480
- It's all right. - You can use my hands.

820
00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:00.879
You can use my hands as a cup.

821
00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:03.790
It might be very hot.

822
00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:06.090
(The master is delighted by his pupil's cute actions.)

823
00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:07.090
Is it warm?

824
00:34:08.730 --> 00:34:09.830
- Is it okay? - It's delicious.

825
00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:16.800
(So is this how it's going to go?)

826
00:34:17.969 --> 00:34:19.600
(Guys, I am his favorite pupil.)

827
00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:21.440
- Let's recite a poem each. - Right.

828
00:34:21.509 --> 00:34:24.270
- He told us... - Why did you...

829
00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:26.409
- Why a poem? - tell us to think of a poem?

830
00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:28.779
It's romantic, isn't it?

831
00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:34.420
Romance is a wish.

832
00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:38.790
They say...

833
00:34:40.690 --> 00:34:45.299
The family doesn't know that the father has a poem in his heart.

834
00:34:45.299 --> 00:34:50.270
(He quotes a saying.)

835
00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:53.569
Fathers usually don't speak out about their feelings.

836
00:34:53.799 --> 00:34:54.839
They usually don't.

837
00:34:55.210 --> 00:34:58.009
They can't spill out what they keep deep inside.

838
00:34:58.009 --> 00:35:01.380
They feel like they have to summarize it in a few words.

839
00:35:02.179 --> 00:35:05.119
But that's what a poem is.

840
00:35:05.679 --> 00:35:08.319
The family doesn't know the father's buried feelings.

841
00:35:08.319 --> 00:35:10.319
(He thinks a poem is words buried in a father's heart.)

842
00:35:10.319 --> 00:35:12.190
(Everyone must have a poem in their heart.)

843
00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:13.420
When I saw this,

844
00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:17.159
I loved it because it's a poem in itself.

845
00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:18.560
This was a poem for me.

846
00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:21.259
It's amazing that you found it.

847
00:35:21.259 --> 00:35:23.730
Anyone would've noticed this.

848
00:35:23.730 --> 00:35:26.770
Why don't you recite it like a poem?

849
00:35:27.569 --> 00:35:29.770
(What?)

850
00:35:31.679 --> 00:35:32.839
Everyone must...

851
00:35:34.679 --> 00:35:36.650
- That's not where you stop. - You should stop after "everyone".

852
00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:38.520
- You should stop after "everyone". - You should stop after "everyone".

853
00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:41.080
Everyone...

854
00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:42.850
must...

855
00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:46.560
bury a poem in their heart.

856
00:35:47.089 --> 00:35:48.389
That was too fast.

857
00:35:48.759 --> 00:35:52.100
Bury a poem... in their heart.

858
00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:54.029
- Bury a poem in their heart. - Bury.

859
00:35:55.369 --> 00:35:57.799
- Everyone... - It's like when you bury something.

860
00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:00.139
Everyone must...

861
00:36:01.869 --> 00:36:02.869
keep...

862
00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:07.339
- a poem in their heart. - It's "bury".

863
00:36:07.339 --> 00:36:09.909
- Bury. - But it says "have".

864
00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:11.480
Read it, sir.

865
00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:13.549
- It says "have a poem". - Right. You're right.

866
00:36:13.850 --> 00:36:16.750
Why are you so harsh on me?

867
00:36:17.949 --> 00:36:19.159
You're right.

868
00:36:20.089 --> 00:36:21.319
You should read it.

869
00:36:21.429 --> 00:36:22.460
He's Seong Jae the sentimentalist.

870
00:36:25.429 --> 00:36:26.460
Everyone...

871
00:36:27.529 --> 00:36:28.529
must...

872
00:36:29.830 --> 00:36:31.000
have a poem...

873
00:36:32.469 --> 00:36:33.670
in their heart.

874
00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:36.869
Good job.

875
00:36:36.869 --> 00:36:38.080
What's his name again?

876
00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:39.710
- Right, he did well. - You...

877
00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:42.049
- read the poem. - Yes.

878
00:36:42.049 --> 00:36:45.319
But you didn't convey...

879
00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:47.150
the feeling of having a poem in your heart.

880
00:36:47.549 --> 00:36:49.989
He's got a poem in his heart.

881
00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:53.219
He's very sentimental.

882
00:36:54.929 --> 00:36:56.389
- That's good enough. - Now,

883
00:36:56.489 --> 00:36:58.560
each of us will recite a poem.

884
00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:00.000
- Let's go with the tide. - Let's recite a poem.

885
00:37:00.199 --> 00:37:02.830
I really like...

886
00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:04.630
Poet Na Tae Ju.

887
00:37:05.369 --> 00:37:07.170
I will tell you the title later.

888
00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:11.540
(He's nervous...)

889
00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:15.310
(to actually recite the poem.)

890
00:37:15.310 --> 00:37:19.679
- Wait. - Gosh.

891
00:37:20.949 --> 00:37:22.389
Get in the mood.

892
00:37:22.389 --> 00:37:25.319
(He relaxes and gets in the mood.)

893
00:37:25.319 --> 00:37:27.020
(He's getting in the mood too.)

894
00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:28.389
I will give it a try.

895
00:37:30.413 --> 00:37:35.413
<font color="#F1E6B2">[VIU Ver] E06 Master in the House / All the Butlers</font>
<font color="#E06287">"Master in the Winter Forest"</font>
<font color="#7474C1">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

896
00:37:37.330 --> 00:37:38.639
On days when I missed you,

897
00:37:39.739 --> 00:37:40.869
I drew a picture.

898
00:37:43.139 --> 00:37:44.369
On days when I felt lonely,

899
00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:47.409
I listened to music.

900
00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:51.210
On days when I had nothing to do,

901
00:37:52.350 --> 00:37:53.350
I...

902
00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:56.449
had to think of you.

903
00:37:58.159 --> 00:38:00.790
It's Na Tae Joo's "How to Live".

904
00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:04.460
(Na Tae Joo's "How to Live")

905
00:38:04.699 --> 00:38:06.699
Why did he have to think of her?

906
00:38:06.929 --> 00:38:08.299
That was the only way he could live.

907
00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:09.799
That's why its title is "How to Live".

908
00:38:09.799 --> 00:38:11.170
They parted.

909
00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:14.299
When he had spare time,

910
00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:16.210
after doing everything he could,

911
00:38:16.409 --> 00:38:18.679
he had to think of her. He did it to live.

912
00:38:18.679 --> 00:38:20.480
- It's... - It sounds like...

913
00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:23.380
he has a broken heart.

914
00:38:24.279 --> 00:38:25.319
Did you break up with your girlfriend?

915
00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:28.449
The relationship with a girl didn't go well, did it?

916
00:38:28.989 --> 00:38:30.089
You saw it well.

917
00:38:30.949 --> 00:38:32.819
(Come on.)

918
00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:36.060
(I can't beat him with my sentiments.)

919
00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:39.029
That's not what happened.

920
00:38:39.529 --> 00:38:44.400
I thought it'd be nice if it's used in a song or in a drama.

921
00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:48.210
That was really lovely. Let's give it up for him.

922
00:38:48.409 --> 00:38:50.770
It as Poet Na Tae Joo's "How To Live".

923
00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:51.980
That was great.

924
00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:53.339
(Thank goodness.)

925
00:38:54.509 --> 00:38:57.779
There was a poem that I came to my mind.

926
00:38:57.779 --> 00:39:00.449
There's a poem I really like.

927
00:39:01.179 --> 00:39:04.190
Seong Jae recited such a sentimental one. This one is not sentimental.

928
00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:07.089
How can a poem not be sentimental?

929
00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:08.929
But... Right.

930
00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:11.259
- He got scolded. - I am sorry.

931
00:39:12.529 --> 00:39:13.560
- Please start. - Okay.

932
00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:14.730
(He doesn't know the importance of sentiments.)

933
00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:17.270
The boiling blood of Red Devil.

934
00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:20.600
Shoot. Shoot. Shoot.

935
00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:24.639
(Shoot?)

936
00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:26.580
The ball...

937
00:39:27.210 --> 00:39:29.610
destroys the opponent, and they shout for joy.

938
00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:34.179
It's mad. It's mad. Everyone is mad.

939
00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:36.549
Anyone who isn't mad...

940
00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:39.119
is the really mad one.

941
00:39:42.029 --> 00:39:43.060
(He's impressed.)

942
00:39:44.029 --> 00:39:45.199
What was that?

943
00:39:45.199 --> 00:39:47.429
My goodness.

944
00:39:47.429 --> 00:39:49.369
So that's his weakness.

945
00:39:51.969 --> 00:39:53.869
I thought it was witty.

946
00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:55.139
Yes.

947
00:39:55.139 --> 00:39:57.110
It's a poem about the situation...

948
00:39:57.170 --> 00:40:00.110
of 2002 World Cup.

949
00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:04.049
Late Pi Chun Deuk wrote this poem.

950
00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:05.679
It's called "Red Devil".

951
00:40:06.119 --> 00:40:09.119
Anyone who isn't mad is the really mad one.

952
00:40:09.119 --> 00:40:11.560
When you think of how crazy it was at the time...

953
00:40:12.219 --> 00:40:15.190
I memorized this poem and recited it to everyone.

954
00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:16.560
"Have you seen this poem?"

955
00:40:16.989 --> 00:40:20.299
Your interpretation of the poem really absorbed me.

956
00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:22.230
- You are a real mad man. - You're too kind.

957
00:40:22.799 --> 00:40:25.299
- You're amazing. - You're amazing.

958
00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:29.909
You prepared a lot. You really prepared for this.

959
00:40:30.310 --> 00:40:31.310
I will go next.

960
00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:32.980
(Se Hyeong gets up.)

961
00:40:33.610 --> 00:40:34.850
(1, 2)

962
00:40:36.750 --> 00:40:38.819
(What is he doing?)

963
00:40:40.049 --> 00:40:41.049
What is that?

964
00:40:41.049 --> 00:40:43.250
(He plays the background music.)

965
00:40:43.850 --> 00:40:46.389
Whether the sun rises or sets,

966
00:40:47.719 --> 00:40:49.330
our sun is always bright.

967
00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:55.000
If one day someone tries...

968
00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:57.969
to block that sun,

969
00:41:00.239 --> 00:41:02.210
like that light that shines through the fingers,

970
00:41:02.610 --> 00:41:04.909
we will shine.

971
00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:08.049
The title is...

972
00:41:08.810 --> 00:41:10.310
"Choi Bool Am and Birch Tree".

973
00:41:11.619 --> 00:41:14.580
I wrote it while we were taking the walk.

974
00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:16.150
My goodness.

975
00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:17.219
("Choi Bool Am and Birch Tree" by Yang Se Hyeong)

976
00:41:17.219 --> 00:41:18.960
- You... - What was that?

977
00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:21.089
just keep surprising me.

978
00:41:21.389 --> 00:41:22.960
A while ago, you...

979
00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:24.360
Did you just write that?

980
00:41:24.489 --> 00:41:25.529
I wrote it.

981
00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:28.969
I saw the sunlight shining through the trees.

982
00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:32.339
And I realized you can see the sunlight even in the forest.

983
00:41:33.069 --> 00:41:34.969
I realized you can always find hope amid adversity.

984
00:41:35.139 --> 00:41:37.369
It's like the light that shines...

985
00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:39.080
through your fingers.

986
00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:40.810
It means...

987
00:41:40.810 --> 00:41:42.810
- Even if someone blocks the sun... - Even if someone blocks the light,

988
00:41:42.810 --> 00:41:44.719
- you still have hope. - you still see the light.

989
00:41:44.719 --> 00:41:46.150
That's what I wanted to express.

990
00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:48.819
- I'm embarrassed. - Don't be.

991
00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:51.150
If you're embarrassed,

992
00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:54.520
then you didn't need the music in the background.

993
00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:57.159
Right, I just wanted to try it.

994
00:41:57.159 --> 00:41:58.560
It has nothing to do with the sunshine...

995
00:41:58.699 --> 00:42:00.630
- or the light. - Right.

996
00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:01.830
(It was too much for Bool Am.)

997
00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:04.199
(Seung Gi is nervous.)

998
00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:08.000
I'm hoping to hear a poem that's better than what these three wrote.

999
00:42:09.069 --> 00:42:11.069
- Take your time to get ready. - I worked so hard on it.

1000
00:42:11.069 --> 00:42:14.909
- Okay. Your poems are all great. - I'm impressed.

1001
00:42:15.350 --> 00:42:17.009
(I need to do something very special.)

1002
00:42:17.549 --> 00:42:18.719
I'm thinking...

1003
00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:21.080
There are various genres of poetry, you know.

1004
00:42:21.350 --> 00:42:23.089
Mine is an acrostic poem, the most-loved genre on variety shows.

1005
00:42:23.089 --> 00:42:24.290
(Acrostic poem)

1006
00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:25.759
(Acrostic poem)

1007
00:42:25.759 --> 00:42:27.989
- I see, an acrostic poem. - I'll come up with one now.

1008
00:42:27.989 --> 00:42:30.259
- I'll think of it as a warm-up. - An acrostic poem?

1009
00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:32.159
I'll try to convey these sentiments...

1010
00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:34.230
- Give it a shot, then. - Choi Bool Am.

1011
00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:36.369
I'll come up with an acrostic poem using your name,

1012
00:42:36.369 --> 00:42:37.670
so let me know what you think.

1013
00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:39.500
Choi Bool Am. I'll use your initials.

1014
00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:41.610
I'll give it a shot.

1015
00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:43.270
- C. - C.

1016
00:42:43.369 --> 00:42:44.369
Choi is tipsy.

1017
00:42:44.509 --> 00:42:45.610
What? Tipsy?

1018
00:42:45.610 --> 00:42:46.610
Not drunk? Just tipsy?

1019
00:42:46.610 --> 00:42:47.810
- Choi is tipsy. - All right, good.

1020
00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:48.810
- Choi is tipsy. - B.

1021
00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:50.980
- Boy, it's uncomfortable. - "It's uncomfortable."

1022
00:42:51.949 --> 00:42:52.949
A.

1023
00:42:53.250 --> 00:42:55.150
I'm missing you

1024
00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:58.190
(Am missing you)

1025
00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:01.219
- I see. "I'm" instead of "Am". - He's good.

1026
00:43:01.219 --> 00:43:02.259
Thanks, Se Hyeong.

1027
00:43:03.989 --> 00:43:05.230
I'm missing you

1028
00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:06.730
(He even did a voice impression.)

1029
00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:08.400
I'll give it a shot too.

1030
00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:10.000
- Sure. - Oh, Master. Really?

1031
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.869
- Well, it's not that good though. - I'm excited.

1032
00:43:12.969 --> 00:43:15.040
- C. - C. The coolest.

1033
00:43:15.969 --> 00:43:18.909
- B. - Be happy.

1034
00:43:19.409 --> 00:43:20.409
- A. - A.

1035
00:43:21.509 --> 00:43:23.480
(Sang Yun is super excited to hear what he'll say.)

1036
00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:24.509
I wonder what he'll say.

1037
00:43:24.509 --> 00:43:31.819
(A)

1038
00:43:31.819 --> 00:43:32.819
- A. - A.

1039
00:43:37.429 --> 00:43:39.330
Have you turned into a rock? Like the Chinese character?

1040
00:43:39.730 --> 00:43:41.929
(Have you become a rock?)

1041
00:43:43.199 --> 00:43:44.799
- He's a rock. - That's what "Am" in my name means.

1042
00:43:44.799 --> 00:43:46.469
This is sensational.

1043
00:43:46.869 --> 00:43:48.139
He expressed it using his body.

1044
00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:49.869
He turned into a rock at the end.

1045
00:43:50.009 --> 00:43:51.779
- No one has done this before. - Choi Bool Am.

1046
00:43:51.779 --> 00:43:53.839
(Bool Am)

1047
00:43:53.909 --> 00:43:54.949
(A rock)

1048
00:43:54.949 --> 00:43:56.779
I've never even thought of doing that.

1049
00:43:58.949 --> 00:44:01.119
- It's hard. - It can be funny, right?

1050
00:44:01.119 --> 00:44:02.119
- Of course. - Sure thing.

1051
00:44:02.119 --> 00:44:03.250
Ours were funny too.

1052
00:44:03.319 --> 00:44:04.350
C.

1053
00:44:04.350 --> 00:44:07.020
Choi hasn't been in many TV shows or films recently,

1054
00:44:08.029 --> 00:44:10.860
so he thinks that young people these days may not know who he is.

1055
00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:12.659
- B. - B.

1056
00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:14.060
Because of that, he's a little anxious.

1057
00:44:15.369 --> 00:44:16.369
- A. - A.

1058
00:44:16.569 --> 00:44:18.040
I'm Choi Bool Am.

1059
00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:21.509
That's pretty good. "I'm".

1060
00:44:21.569 --> 00:44:22.969
Sang Yun is actually good at this.

1061
00:44:22.969 --> 00:44:24.139
- Impressive. - That was pretty good.

1062
00:44:24.139 --> 00:44:25.139
(From English and Korean to Chinese)

1063
00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:26.710
"I'm Choi Bool Am."

1064
00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:31.110
- That hurt my feelings though. - "I'm Choi Bool Am."

1065
00:44:32.219 --> 00:44:34.889
(Sang Yun musters up the courage to ask him about it.)

1066
00:44:34.889 --> 00:44:38.290
Why is it that we never see you in movies or TV dramas these days?

1067
00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:41.889
While working on the last TV drama I was in,

1068
00:44:43.089 --> 00:44:44.130
I thought that...

1069
00:44:45.830 --> 00:44:47.360
I should quit dramas altogether.

1070
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.029
- TV dramas? - It's because...

1071
00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:51.170
I felt too distanced.

1072
00:44:51.569 --> 00:44:54.040
From everyone including the directors and scriptwriters.

1073
00:44:54.299 --> 00:44:57.540
I was hoping that they'd correct me whenever I made a mistake...

1074
00:44:57.540 --> 00:44:59.110
or when they weren't happy with my acting,

1075
00:44:59.810 --> 00:45:02.279
but all of them just kept agreeing with me and complimenting me,

1076
00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:03.810
so I couldn't improve.

1077
00:45:03.810 --> 00:45:05.179
(He felt that he wasn't improving.)

1078
00:45:05.179 --> 00:45:07.850
I'm not sure if I can say this,

1079
00:45:07.850 --> 00:45:09.420
but I think that attitude is so inspiring.

1080
00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:11.819
- The way I think? - Yes.

1081
00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:13.190
What's inspiring about it?

1082
00:45:13.319 --> 00:45:16.060
The fact that you think like that. I don't know if there are...

1083
00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:17.790
other actors who think that way.

1084
00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:19.860
I didn't really retire from acting.

1085
00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:22.029
I stepped down to make room for younger actors.

1086
00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:25.839
I didn't want to make anyone uncomfortable.

1087
00:45:28.409 --> 00:45:34.710
(This veteran actor played father characters for 50 years.)

1088
00:45:37.049 --> 00:45:39.619
(He was like a friend, a son,)

1089
00:45:39.619 --> 00:45:43.389
(and a father to every Korean in all those years.)

1090
00:45:43.389 --> 00:45:45.020
(Leaving the thing...)

1091
00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:49.489
(that meant everything to you)

1092
00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:53.560
(His words carry an immeasurable weight of time.)

1093
00:45:56.569 --> 00:45:58.670
Master, then today...

1094
00:45:59.069 --> 00:46:00.339
- Actually... - Where will you take us?

1095
00:46:00.339 --> 00:46:02.839
We're obviously not going to his place.

1096
00:46:02.839 --> 00:46:04.239
- Where will we stay? - Where are we going?

1097
00:46:04.239 --> 00:46:05.279
Are we going to stay here?

1098
00:46:05.279 --> 00:46:06.880
On my way here...

1099
00:46:07.279 --> 00:46:09.949
My comrades live nearby. They're my friends.

1100
00:46:09.949 --> 00:46:11.150
(Comrades?)

1101
00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:13.049
- I'm going to sleep at their place. - I see.

1102
00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:14.679
Do you guys want to come with me?

1103
00:46:14.679 --> 00:46:16.190
- Yes, of course. - We'd love to.

1104
00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:17.190
(They'll meet his "comrades" too?)

1105
00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:18.759
- Then we should go to that town. - Yes.

1106
00:46:19.290 --> 00:46:20.960
- Okay. - When we get there... Hang on.

1107
00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:22.190
I should call them.

1108
00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:25.460
My gosh, I'm very excited right now because...

1109
00:46:25.730 --> 00:46:28.330
Master travels all over the country to...

1110
00:46:28.330 --> 00:46:29.529
- "Korean Food Table". - Exactly.

1111
00:46:29.529 --> 00:46:31.670
He travels all over the country to taste delicacies, you know.

1112
00:46:32.199 --> 00:46:34.969
- Master, I'm really excited too. - I wonder what he'll eat today.

1113
00:46:34.969 --> 00:46:36.610
- No, no. - All of us are excited.

1114
00:46:36.610 --> 00:46:38.880
I should have them prepare some food then, right?

1115
00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:41.040
- Yes. - I should give them a heads-up.

1116
00:46:41.679 --> 00:46:43.850
Well, I'm... Let's just go there first.

1117
00:46:45.219 --> 00:46:46.449
All right, let's go have some food!

1118
00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:52.489
I never thought I'd get to meet you...

1119
00:46:52.759 --> 00:46:54.730
on a variety show.

1120
00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:58.330
I always thought of Master as someone...

1121
00:46:58.330 --> 00:47:02.000
whom I can only see on TV or in books.

1122
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.029
(He's the epitome of the ideal father figure.)

1123
00:47:04.969 --> 00:47:06.940
Hang on. I should call them now.

1124
00:47:08.069 --> 00:47:10.270
(Whom is he calling?)

1125
00:47:10.270 --> 00:47:12.509
It's me.

1126
00:47:13.339 --> 00:47:16.880
("The Godfather" starring Choi Bool Am)

1127
00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:18.949
I'm on my way now. I'll be there in about 10 minutes.

1128
00:47:19.850 --> 00:47:21.750
I'm almost there. Did you get a chance to prepare some snacks?

1129
00:47:22.850 --> 00:47:23.850
- Will we drink right away? - Snacks?

1130
00:47:23.850 --> 00:47:24.920
(We'll eat and drink this soon?)

1131
00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:26.520
You don't need to prepare too much.

1132
00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:28.560
This is amazing.

1133
00:47:28.659 --> 00:47:30.259
- I'm already salivating. - My gosh.

1134
00:47:30.759 --> 00:47:31.830
Where should I meet you guys?

1135
00:47:32.299 --> 00:47:34.500
What? Where Zhang Fei used to live?

1136
00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:38.299
All right. I'll see you soon.

1137
00:47:38.299 --> 00:47:39.940
(Zhang Fei?)

1138
00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:41.100
- Zhang Fei? - Zhang Fei?

1139
00:47:41.639 --> 00:47:42.909
- Who was that? - I'll tell you guys when we arrive.

1140
00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:47.940
(Is it his friend?)

1141
00:47:48.779 --> 00:47:50.750
(I won't tell you guys just yet.)

1142
00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:53.080
(They're in the heart of the mountains.)

1143
00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:54.920
- We're inside the mountains. - Look at that. Gosh.

1144
00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:56.420
We're really in the heart of the mountains.

1145
00:47:56.420 --> 00:47:58.190
(They still don't know who Zhang Fei is.)

1146
00:47:58.319 --> 00:48:00.589
(They follow this narrow, twisty road...)

1147
00:48:00.589 --> 00:48:01.589
(that's like a maze.)

1148
00:48:01.589 --> 00:48:03.029
Look at the trees over here.

1149
00:48:03.190 --> 00:48:04.759
They look so old.

1150
00:48:04.759 --> 00:48:07.199
(They keep driving, but the scenery doesn't change.)

1151
00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:10.900
If it snows... Gosh, it'll be disastrous.

1152
00:48:10.969 --> 00:48:13.170
We won't be able to get out of here if it snows a lot.

1153
00:48:13.170 --> 00:48:14.239
Yes, totally.

1154
00:48:14.639 --> 00:48:16.069
I heard it goes down to minus 20°C here in winter.

1155
00:48:16.069 --> 00:48:17.069
Minus 20°C?

1156
00:48:17.069 --> 00:48:18.409
(Did they foresee their future?)

1157
00:48:18.409 --> 00:48:20.110
- Gosh. - What is this?

1158
00:48:20.110 --> 00:48:21.710
My gosh, I've never experienced weather like this.

1159
00:48:22.049 --> 00:48:23.110
Guys, let's hurry.

1160
00:48:23.110 --> 00:48:24.350
We won't be able to leave tomorrow.

1161
00:48:24.350 --> 00:48:25.679
I feel like I'm on a survival show.

1162
00:48:25.679 --> 00:48:27.080
(No one can get out of here!)

1163
00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:28.089
We're totally stranded here.

1164
00:48:28.290 --> 00:48:29.690
Master, isn't this where we're going?

1165
00:48:29.690 --> 00:48:30.819
(They don't know what's awaiting them.)

1166
00:48:30.819 --> 00:48:32.759
We're here. It's that house over there.

1167
00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:34.020
- Oh, that house? - Yes.

1168
00:48:35.089 --> 00:48:36.159
(At the end of the maze)

1169
00:48:36.159 --> 00:48:37.759
- This town... - That's Zhang Fei's place.

1170
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.029
Zhang Fei.

1171
00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:44.170
- We sure are in Gangwon Province. - The air is so fresh.

1172
00:48:44.429 --> 00:48:45.440
We're really in Gangwon Province now.

1173
00:48:46.239 --> 00:48:49.009
(The frozen nature...)

1174
00:48:49.009 --> 00:48:51.779
(dazzles us with its beauty.)

1175
00:48:53.279 --> 00:48:54.909
(The bonfire warms them up.)

1176
00:48:54.909 --> 00:48:56.750
What's that? I see smoke.

1177
00:48:56.750 --> 00:48:57.850
My gosh! Hold on.

1178
00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:00.319
- Something's cooking in the pot. - They already started the fire.

1179
00:49:00.319 --> 00:49:01.319
It's...

1180
00:49:01.589 --> 00:49:04.219
With you here, this actually looks like "Korean Food Table" now.

1181
00:49:04.219 --> 00:49:06.190
- I see this all the time. - You're right.

1182
00:49:06.190 --> 00:49:07.790
Are they cooking something for Master?

1183
00:49:07.790 --> 00:49:09.460
(Hongcheon Food Table)

1184
00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:10.529
Can we open this?

1185
00:49:13.159 --> 00:49:14.159
- Oh, my. - What's that?

1186
00:49:15.069 --> 00:49:16.799
- I see herbs. - Wow.

1187
00:49:17.230 --> 00:49:18.339
They're making broth.

1188
00:49:18.739 --> 00:49:20.670
- That's... - All sorts of herbs are in it.

1189
00:49:20.670 --> 00:49:21.670
Yes.

1190
00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:22.710
- Bellflower roots. - Bellflower roots.

1191
00:49:22.810 --> 00:49:24.369
- I see lacquer tree barks. - They'll make chicken stew.

1192
00:49:24.739 --> 00:49:26.139
It smells very healthy.

1193
00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:29.650
Chicken will go in here. Anything will taste good in this broth.

1194
00:49:29.650 --> 00:49:31.009
- Like baeksuk. - Exactly.

1195
00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:35.420
Most cooking scenes in "Korean Food Table" look like this.

1196
00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:36.949
- That's right. - What Master does is...

1197
00:49:36.949 --> 00:49:39.659
Let's say that there's a lady here cooking away.

1198
00:49:39.860 --> 00:49:44.029
Master shows up saying, "What are you making?"

1199
00:49:44.159 --> 00:49:46.860
(Hongcheon Food Table, See you next week.)

1200
00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:49.799
So, whose house is this?

1201
00:49:50.199 --> 00:49:51.799
This is Liu Bei's place.

1202
00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:53.770
- Liu Bei? - Yes.

1203
00:49:53.770 --> 00:49:55.509
So, there are Zhang Fei and Liu Bei?

1204
00:49:55.509 --> 00:49:58.009
Zhang Fei, Liu Bei, and Guan Yu as in "Records of the Three Kingdoms"?

1205
00:49:58.009 --> 00:50:00.080
- Are they their real names? - That's right, Zhang Fei.

1206
00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:02.710
- Are they brothers? - No, they're just nicknames.

1207
00:50:03.580 --> 00:50:05.279
While I was shooting the drama, "Heaven's Garden", here,

1208
00:50:05.449 --> 00:50:07.179
They helped me out a lot.

1209
00:50:07.650 --> 00:50:09.250
Is there Guan Yu too?

1210
00:50:10.989 --> 00:50:12.960
- Yes, there's Guan Yu too. - Really?

1211
00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:13.960
(There's Guan Yu too.)

1212
00:50:13.989 --> 00:50:15.460
Does that mean you're Zhuge Liang?

1213
00:50:16.330 --> 00:50:18.600
Zhuge Liang? No, I'm not Zhuge Liang.

1214
00:50:20.029 --> 00:50:22.130
(Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei)

1215
00:50:22.130 --> 00:50:24.699
(Are they real people?)

1216
00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:31.069
(Back in the days when the Choi Bool Am series jokes were popular,)

1217
00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:35.810
(there lived 3 brothers.)

1218
00:50:37.179 --> 00:50:43.750
(Their hands are filled with delicious goodies.)

1219
00:50:45.619 --> 00:50:48.159
(With wild boar legs, homemade liquor,)

1220
00:50:48.159 --> 00:50:52.299
(and dried radish greens)

1221
00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:58.199
(We're on our way to meet you like the first snow.)

1222
00:50:59.969 --> 00:51:03.170
(Snowflakes just started falling down.)

1223
00:51:05.710 --> 00:51:09.549
(Along with the fluttering snowflakes,)

1224
00:51:09.549 --> 00:51:13.779
(they arrive.)

1225
00:51:17.790 --> 00:51:19.960
Oh, over there... I think...

1226
00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:20.960
There they are.

1227
00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:23.860
(The 3 brothers are here.)

1228
00:51:23.860 --> 00:51:26.630
- Hello. - Oh, there they are.

1229
00:51:26.699 --> 00:51:28.270
- Hello. - Hello.

1230
00:51:28.270 --> 00:51:29.929
(They're here to meet the master.)

1231
00:51:29.929 --> 00:51:31.299
They must be Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei.

1232
00:51:31.299 --> 00:51:32.869
- It's been so long. - He bowed so politely.

1233
00:51:32.869 --> 00:51:34.369
- It's good to see you. - My gosh.

1234
00:51:34.869 --> 00:51:36.639
- You look the same. - Goodness.

1235
00:51:40.210 --> 00:51:41.750
Hey, your hair is all white now.

1236
00:51:42.110 --> 00:51:44.279
- It's always been like this. - Goodness.

1237
00:51:44.279 --> 00:51:46.350
(The white hair shows how much time has passed.)

1238
00:51:48.350 --> 00:51:49.389
You look the same.

1239
00:51:50.119 --> 00:51:51.759
- Bool Am, you look the same. - What are you talking about?

1240
00:51:52.159 --> 00:51:54.290
It's not like time doesn't flow for some people.

1241
00:51:55.529 --> 00:51:57.230
Time only stops when you die.

1242
00:52:01.159 --> 00:52:05.369
Seeing you makes me feel alive.

1243
00:52:05.799 --> 00:52:06.839
Really?

1244
00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:09.210
- How many years has it been? - Right, how long has it been?

1245
00:52:10.409 --> 00:52:12.679
(They deeply missed each other.)

1246
00:52:12.679 --> 00:52:15.049
- He's so happy to see them. - I know, right?

1247
00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:17.610
- His eyes are welled up with tears. - Yes.

1248
00:52:18.449 --> 00:52:19.580
I missed you, Bool Am.

1249
00:52:19.779 --> 00:52:20.850
- I missed you guys too. - I know.

1250
00:52:21.219 --> 00:52:23.389
Let me hold your hand again.

1251
00:52:23.389 --> 00:52:24.420
(They've been waiting for this moment.)

1252
00:52:24.420 --> 00:52:25.719
- My gosh. - We really missed you.

1253
00:52:27.319 --> 00:52:28.830
Where's your wife?

1254
00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:31.630
She's in the countryside.

1255
00:52:31.630 --> 00:52:33.600
Well, she said she'd be back, but she's not back yet.

1256
00:52:36.170 --> 00:52:38.100
(I beg your pardon?)

1257
00:52:38.969 --> 00:52:40.339
You should've treated her better.

1258
00:52:41.569 --> 00:52:44.110
The better you treat them, the more they want to leave you.

1259
00:52:44.310 --> 00:52:46.040
- That's... - Does he mean...

1260
00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:48.350
that his wife isn't back yet?

1261
00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:51.549
- Where is she now? - I don't know.

1262
00:52:51.549 --> 00:52:52.580
(We can't tell whether he's joking or not.)

1263
00:52:53.449 --> 00:52:55.350
- It's cold. Let's go in. - But...

1264
00:52:55.449 --> 00:52:56.650
- It's too cold. Let's go in. - Okay.

1265
00:52:56.650 --> 00:52:58.790
- It's freezing. Let's go inside. - Can we go in too?

1266
00:52:58.790 --> 00:53:00.159
(Master, what about us?)

1267
00:53:00.159 --> 00:53:01.529
I should introduce you guys to them.

1268
00:53:01.529 --> 00:53:02.529
(He had forgotten about them.)

1269
00:53:02.529 --> 00:53:03.730
- Master. - All right.

1270
00:53:03.929 --> 00:53:05.360
Guys, say hello.

1271
00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:08.670
This is Zhang Fei.

1272
00:53:08.670 --> 00:53:09.969
He's Zhang Fei. Hello.

1273
00:53:10.799 --> 00:53:13.900
(The cool guy, Zhang Fei, age 73)

1274
00:53:14.199 --> 00:53:16.670
- He's Zhang Fei. Hello. - Hello.

1275
00:53:17.110 --> 00:53:18.909
- It's nice to meet you guys. - We're happy to meet you.

1276
00:53:18.909 --> 00:53:20.810
This is Liu Bei.

1277
00:53:20.909 --> 00:53:21.949
- Oh, hello. - Hello.

1278
00:53:22.549 --> 00:53:25.750
(The gentleman, Liu Bei, age 74)

1279
00:53:26.279 --> 00:53:27.520
(Master gave them the nicknames.)

1280
00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:29.350
This is the oldest one, Guan Yu.

1281
00:53:29.350 --> 00:53:30.920
- Hello. - Hello.

1282
00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:34.790
(The big brother, Guan Yu, age 83)

1283
00:53:35.159 --> 00:53:36.460
(Polite)

1284
00:53:36.460 --> 00:53:37.529
It's nice to meet you.

1285
00:53:37.529 --> 00:53:39.299
Now that we've met, we should shake hands.

1286
00:53:40.159 --> 00:53:41.469
- Here. - It's very nice to meet you.

1287
00:53:41.469 --> 00:53:43.029
- It's nice to meet you. - Likewise. Thank you.

1288
00:53:43.369 --> 00:53:45.369
Hey, did you serve in the special forces?

1289
00:53:45.739 --> 00:53:47.170
Yes, I did serve in the special forces.

1290
00:53:47.170 --> 00:53:48.610
- Really? - Yes.

1291
00:53:48.839 --> 00:53:50.869
He served in the Marine Corps.

1292
00:53:50.869 --> 00:53:52.839
- The Marine Corps, I see. - Yes.

1293
00:53:52.839 --> 00:53:55.549
I could tell. You're very charismatic.

1294
00:53:55.679 --> 00:53:57.179
- It's cold, so let's go in now. - Okay.

1295
00:53:57.179 --> 00:53:58.549
- We can talk inside. - Let's go in.

1296
00:53:58.549 --> 00:53:59.779
Okay, go ahead.

1297
00:53:59.779 --> 00:54:01.150
What kind of snacks did you guys prepare?

1298
00:54:01.279 --> 00:54:03.150
(They're going into Liu Bei's place.)

1299
00:54:03.150 --> 00:54:04.250
- Go in, Bool Am. - Okay.

1300
00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:06.889
- My, look at that. - Gosh.

1301
00:54:06.889 --> 00:54:09.330
- There are jars of liquor. - It's like a liquor storage room.

1302
00:54:09.330 --> 00:54:10.630
- It really is. - Amazing.

1303
00:54:11.330 --> 00:54:12.330
This is awesome.

1304
00:54:12.330 --> 00:54:13.699
(The room is filled with homemade liquor.)

1305
00:54:13.699 --> 00:54:15.600
Are they all homemade?

1306
00:54:15.869 --> 00:54:18.139
This is like the perfect hangout.

1307
00:54:18.139 --> 00:54:21.000
Gosh, this is amazing. I love this vibe.

1308
00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:24.839
(It looks like we can look forward to today's lunch.)

1309
00:54:24.839 --> 00:54:27.179
Feel free to ask them for help.

1310
00:54:27.179 --> 00:54:29.480
Okay. If we run out of snacks later...

1311
00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:31.920
Yes, anytime. I'm very quick.

1312
00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:33.150
Do you know how to catch a chicken?

1313
00:54:33.319 --> 00:54:34.480
- A chicken? - Yes.

1314
00:54:36.319 --> 00:54:38.219
- A live chicken? - Of course.

1315
00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:39.560
Who catches a dead chicken?

1316
00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:41.089
(Why would anyone catch a dead chicken?)

1317
00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:43.259
(Sang Yun's eyes are quivering.)

1318
00:54:43.460 --> 00:54:44.630
You'll have to catch a live chicken.

1319
00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:46.960
(I'm in trouble.)

1320
00:54:47.659 --> 00:54:49.130
(Don't be scared. We're just kidding.)

1321
00:54:49.730 --> 00:54:51.069
(They're already frozen.)

1322
00:54:51.069 --> 00:54:53.699
Anyway, make yourselves at home, guys.

1323
00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:55.869
(Oh, okay.)

1324
00:54:55.869 --> 00:54:57.569
The food must be here. I think it's here.

1325
00:54:59.710 --> 00:55:01.610
- It looks amazing. - We should go bring it.

1326
00:55:01.610 --> 00:55:02.610
My gosh.

1327
00:55:03.279 --> 00:55:04.279
Oh, my. This is...

1328
00:55:04.549 --> 00:55:06.080
- What is it? - Gosh, that's...

1329
00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:07.580
(It's a feast.)

1330
00:55:07.580 --> 00:55:08.650
This is... Oh, my.

1331
00:55:08.650 --> 00:55:09.949
(For the hungry young men)

1332
00:55:09.949 --> 00:55:11.119
This is really...

1333
00:55:12.460 --> 00:55:13.889
We don't eat many side dishes here in this small country town.

1334
00:55:14.759 --> 00:55:16.230
There are so many side dishes.

1335
00:55:17.389 --> 00:55:20.060
- Deep-fried bellflower roots? - Yes, that's right.

1336
00:55:20.060 --> 00:55:21.569
(Bellflower roots that have endured the cold weather)

1337
00:55:21.569 --> 00:55:24.069
(Bracken fern that smells like the mountains)

1338
00:55:24.069 --> 00:55:26.540
(And there's even freshly caught wild boar that Zhang Fei brought.)

1339
00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:28.909
(Everything on this table is from Hongcheon.)

1340
00:55:28.909 --> 00:55:31.339
(It really is Hongcheon Food Table.)

1341
00:55:31.610 --> 00:55:34.139
The two of us went out to the field and plowed through the snow...

1342
00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:36.710
to dig those up yesterday.

1343
00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:38.119
(He places the glasses neatly.)

1344
00:55:38.119 --> 00:55:39.679
(Sang Yun seems especially enthusiastic.)

1345
00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:42.489
- That's right. - This must be it.

1346
00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:44.389
Why did you take all of them? There are four over there too.

1347
00:55:44.549 --> 00:55:46.520
(We need 4 over there too.)

1348
00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:48.089
- Oh, right. - I'm sorry.

1349
00:55:48.790 --> 00:55:51.960
Do this, will you?

1350
00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:54.600
- Sang Yun. Do this, okay? - I know.

1351
00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:56.569
- Gosh, I'm... - You should've counted them.

1352
00:55:56.569 --> 00:55:57.569
I know. Gosh.

1353
00:55:58.069 --> 00:55:59.869
(Teasing them is fun.)

1354
00:55:59.869 --> 00:56:02.739
The first thing you guys need to taste is bellflower roots.

1355
00:56:02.739 --> 00:56:04.369
- Bellflower roots? - Try it.

1356
00:56:04.469 --> 00:56:07.310
Liu Bei went out to the field and plowed through the snow...

1357
00:56:07.310 --> 00:56:09.710
to dig those up because you were visiting.

1358
00:56:09.710 --> 00:56:11.210
(Liu Bei harvested the bellflower roots himself.)

1359
00:56:11.210 --> 00:56:12.779
We should try the bellflower roots.

1360
00:56:14.989 --> 00:56:16.589
If you mix these two together,

1361
00:56:16.650 --> 00:56:18.719
- you can't... - The bellflower roots are so good.

1362
00:56:19.790 --> 00:56:22.960
- It's savory. - It's really good. The greens too.

1363
00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:23.989
(It almost tastes like meat.)

1364
00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:26.159
Is this the wild boar meat?

1365
00:56:26.799 --> 00:56:29.100
- It's steamed with spices. - Steamed meat with spices.

1366
00:56:29.529 --> 00:56:30.600
It doesn't taste like boar.

1367
00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:33.170
Just eat it. It's good for you.

1368
00:56:34.069 --> 00:56:36.040
I didn't think wild boar meat would be this tender.

1369
00:56:36.569 --> 00:56:37.770
- It's really good. - Yes, it is.

1370
00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:39.880
The kimchi is so good.

1371
00:56:40.210 --> 00:56:42.909
- My, it's delicious. - It tastes perfect.

1372
00:56:44.250 --> 00:56:45.650
All right. Let's eat, guys.

1373
00:56:50.150 --> 00:56:52.719
(Why is he turning his chair that way?)

1374
00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:54.830
- Cheers. - Cheers.

1375
00:56:55.290 --> 00:56:56.489
- Cheers. - Cheers.

1376
00:56:56.489 --> 00:56:58.460
- Bool Am, it's so good to see you. - Take care of your health.

1377
00:56:58.460 --> 00:57:00.560
(Let's clink our glasses without those youngsters.)

1378
00:57:00.759 --> 00:57:01.770
Okay.

1379
00:57:02.270 --> 00:57:04.600
(They're embarrassed.)

1380
00:57:04.900 --> 00:57:07.299
It helps mentally.

1381
00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:08.639
It's a nice break, you know.

1382
00:57:09.110 --> 00:57:11.779
We met because all of us like to drink.

1383
00:57:11.779 --> 00:57:12.940
Drinking is great.

1384
00:57:12.940 --> 00:57:14.409
Master has completely turned his back on us.

1385
00:57:15.610 --> 00:57:16.779
Guan Yu, it's been so long.

1386
00:57:16.779 --> 00:57:20.420
It's been too long. I almost cried because I missed you so much.

1387
00:57:20.420 --> 00:57:22.049
(He filled his glass with his tears.)

1388
00:57:22.319 --> 00:57:24.219
Let's have another glass. Give me that.

1389
00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:25.520
- Me? - Yes.

1390
00:57:25.690 --> 00:57:27.190
I've already had three glasses.

1391
00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:28.929
What are you talking about? You've only had two.

1392
00:57:29.060 --> 00:57:30.330
Gosh, I can't fool you.

1393
00:57:30.389 --> 00:57:32.600
I'll pour you a glass. Just drink it.

1394
00:57:34.659 --> 00:57:35.799
- Don't lean against it. - Pick up your glass.

1395
00:57:36.170 --> 00:57:37.170
Here, I picked it up.

1396
00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:39.600
(What's going on? Are they fighting?)

1397
00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:41.670
Then, do the three of you...

1398
00:57:41.940 --> 00:57:43.440
What's the name of this vegetable?

1399
00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:44.469
(They can't even hear Se Hyeong.)

1400
00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:46.940
(They've been rejected.)

1401
00:57:46.940 --> 00:57:49.779
- I think this is thistle. - Right, by the way...

1402
00:57:50.110 --> 00:57:53.580
Bool Am, are your joints okay?

1403
00:57:54.619 --> 00:57:57.449
I had heart problems. Arrhythmia.

1404
00:57:58.589 --> 00:58:01.759
Then you should drink the liquor made with wasps.

1405
00:58:02.690 --> 00:58:05.830
- Try a little. - Is it good for the heart?

1406
00:58:06.230 --> 00:58:08.400
It unclogs arteries.

1407
00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:10.230
It's like getting stung by a bee.

1408
00:58:11.170 --> 00:58:12.600
Alcohol cures all ailments.

1409
00:58:14.369 --> 00:58:16.170
- Bool Am likes this liquor. - Yes.

1410
00:58:16.469 --> 00:58:19.339
This one is good for blood circulation.

1411
00:58:19.480 --> 00:58:20.739
Hawthorn berry liquor helps with circulation.

1412
00:58:21.409 --> 00:58:24.449
I really enjoyed the one you sent me a long time ago.

1413
00:58:24.449 --> 00:58:25.750
(The distance between us and Master)

1414
00:58:27.779 --> 00:58:28.949
Hey, it's snowing a lot.

1415
00:58:30.690 --> 00:58:33.219
(Like the brothers' chat)

1416
00:58:33.219 --> 00:58:34.860
- I think we'll get caught. - I know.

1417
00:58:34.860 --> 00:58:36.429
(The snow keeps piling up.)

1418
00:58:38.600 --> 00:58:39.600
- Shall we step out? - Bool Am.

1419
00:58:39.730 --> 00:58:40.759
If it's now...

1420
00:58:41.060 --> 00:58:42.299
(Will it be okay though?)

1421
00:58:42.299 --> 00:58:43.869
- But... - If it's together...

1422
00:58:43.869 --> 00:58:46.170
(They're talking,)

1423
00:58:46.170 --> 00:58:48.440
(so they won't know if we sneak out quietly.)

1424
00:58:48.440 --> 00:58:50.569
(They communicate through body language.)

1425
00:58:51.679 --> 00:58:53.080
- Bool Am. - We should put on our jackets.

1426
00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:56.610
Those who don't come aren't your real friends.

1427
00:58:56.610 --> 00:58:57.810
When will you do it?

1428
00:58:58.350 --> 00:58:59.750
- My 80th birthday party? - Yes.

1429
00:58:59.850 --> 00:59:02.850
My 80th day party... Does it have to be on my birthday?

1430
00:59:02.949 --> 00:59:03.949
- No. - No.

1431
00:59:04.250 --> 00:59:05.960
- You can do it before. - Before your birthday is fine too.

1432
00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:07.860
- I can do it whenever I want? - Yes.

1433
00:59:07.860 --> 00:59:09.029
You should...

1434
00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:12.699
Well, when would be good?

1435
00:59:12.900 --> 00:59:15.170
It should be a day that works for everyone.

1436
00:59:15.230 --> 00:59:17.699
Anyway, my birthday is...

1437
00:59:18.770 --> 00:59:21.040
(They've finally...)

1438
00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:23.739
(escaped the awkward situation.)

1439
00:59:24.940 --> 00:59:27.580
(Snow is the only thing that welcomes us.)

1440
00:59:27.580 --> 00:59:30.179
I've never been in that kind of situation. Have you?

1441
00:59:30.250 --> 00:59:32.549
- The situation was funny. - It was hilarious.

1442
00:59:33.219 --> 00:59:35.020
- The snow has piled up quite a bit. - The snow looks so lovely.

1443
00:59:35.020 --> 00:59:37.420
My, this place is amazing. How can it look like this?

1444
00:59:37.949 --> 00:59:40.060
- I'm happy he brought us here. - It's so beautiful.

1445
00:59:40.759 --> 00:59:41.790
The scenery is picturesque.

1446
00:59:42.690 --> 00:59:45.500
Gosh. I must say, we can never see snow like this in Seoul.

1447
00:59:49.770 --> 00:59:51.799
It really snows a lot here.

1448
00:59:51.799 --> 00:59:55.710
(They keep marveling at the scenery they rarely get to see.)

1449
00:59:56.739 --> 00:59:57.770
It's cold.

1450
00:59:59.839 --> 01:00:02.880
We rarely get to see snow like this, you know.

1451
01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:04.080
- That's right. - Then...

1452
01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:07.219
let's play a game here to decide who will sleep beside Master tonight.

1453
01:00:07.219 --> 01:00:08.389
(Let's decided here.)

1454
01:00:09.250 --> 01:00:10.250
What do you guys think?

1455
01:00:10.250 --> 01:00:13.420
(On the snow?)

1456
01:00:13.790 --> 01:00:14.790
It won't be easy.

1457
01:00:14.790 --> 01:00:16.730
(It doesn't sound like it'll be easy.)

1458
01:00:17.529 --> 01:00:19.699
Really? I don't think it's a bad idea.

1459
01:00:19.699 --> 01:00:21.770
(I don't care as long as it's not me.)

1460
01:00:22.170 --> 01:00:23.830
What do you think? But don't forget.

1461
01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:25.699
It'll be a little different today.

1462
01:00:26.170 --> 01:00:28.610
Whoever that gets picked will have to wash his face and feet for him.

1463
01:00:28.610 --> 01:00:30.369
- Will it really be okay though? - And the matching pajamas.

1464
01:00:30.369 --> 01:00:33.739
- You'll have to give him a hug too. - And sing a lullaby.

1465
01:00:33.739 --> 01:00:35.949
- A lullaby. - Right, that too.

1466
01:00:35.949 --> 01:00:37.009
(Whoever that gets picked...)

1467
01:00:37.009 --> 01:00:40.619
(will have to do all of the aforementioned with the master.)

1468
01:00:42.889 --> 01:00:46.159
(Even just the thought of it scares them.)

1469
01:00:48.029 --> 01:00:50.589
I really missed you guys.

1470
01:00:50.589 --> 01:00:51.630
(I want to see who will sleep beside me!)

1471
01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:54.159
What about this game? Shall we just do it?

1472
01:00:54.159 --> 01:00:55.529
(They'll play a game on the snow.)

1473
01:00:55.529 --> 01:00:57.029
- We should use the snow. - Oh, right.

1474
01:00:57.029 --> 01:00:58.299
- I got an idea. - What is it?

1475
01:00:58.299 --> 01:00:59.369
(What's the game using snow?)

1476
01:00:59.369 --> 01:01:02.210
You've all tried dunking your faces in water, right?

1477
01:01:03.110 --> 01:01:05.440
How about the four of us dunk our faces in snow?

1478
01:01:05.839 --> 01:01:09.110
- The one that gets up first... - Yes, he'll sleep beside Master.

1479
01:01:10.310 --> 01:01:13.150
(It's snowing so much now,)

1480
01:01:13.150 --> 01:01:15.250
(and there's already a lot of snow piled up.)

1481
01:01:16.190 --> 01:01:18.219
(A heavy snow warning is issued, and it feels like minus 30°C.)

1482
01:01:18.219 --> 01:01:19.259
("Everything Is Frozen")

1483
01:01:19.259 --> 01:01:21.319
("Even Seawater Is Frozen in Gangwon Province")

1484
01:01:21.630 --> 01:01:24.060
(They might freeze to death before they can even sleep.)

1485
01:01:25.830 --> 01:01:28.670
(Will I be able to go back in one piece?)

1486
01:01:29.469 --> 01:01:30.600
So? Isn't it a good idea?

1487
01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:32.639
Like totally in the snow?

1488
01:01:32.969 --> 01:01:34.369
Exactly. All the way in.

1489
01:01:34.540 --> 01:01:36.009
Then we won't be able to breathe, right?

1490
01:01:36.009 --> 01:01:38.239
You can still breathe, but your skin will feel like it's about to rip.

1491
01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:40.980
This is really...

1492
01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:43.480
This is crazy.

1493
01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:44.580
(Forget all the pain tolerance games.)

1494
01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:46.279
- It's not really a game. - When we get up,

1495
01:01:46.279 --> 01:01:47.750
our lips will be all purple.

1496
01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:49.290
Gosh, I know how painful this is.

1497
01:01:49.290 --> 01:01:51.319
- I'm serious. It hurts. - I bet. It must hurt.

1498
01:01:51.619 --> 01:01:53.259
I bet it'll hurt. That's exactly why we're doing it.

1499
01:01:53.659 --> 01:01:54.889
But I want to win.

1500
01:01:54.889 --> 01:01:57.630
I'll have to awaken my special forces spirit. I'll need it.

1501
01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:00.460
- This is really... - Guys, let's warm up.

1502
01:02:00.699 --> 01:02:01.799
Let's warm up.

1503
01:02:02.429 --> 01:02:05.699
(Their face warm-up exercise is making them look so ugly.)

1504
01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:08.110
This definitely won't be easy.

1505
01:02:09.310 --> 01:02:10.509
(He's having mixed feelings.)

1506
01:02:10.509 --> 01:02:11.639
The one who gets up first...

1507
01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:16.110
shouldn't try to make others suffer more.

1508
01:02:16.110 --> 01:02:18.619
- Tell the rest of us to get up. - Yes, totally.

1509
01:02:18.619 --> 01:02:20.250
- Otherwise, it'll be dangerous. - Okay.

1510
01:02:20.319 --> 01:02:21.750
- Got it. - Our skin can actually rip.

1511
01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:23.049
All right, let's do this.

1512
01:02:23.049 --> 01:02:24.790
(I'm in deep trouble.)

1513
01:02:24.790 --> 01:02:26.089
As long as I'm not the first one that gets up.

1514
01:02:26.089 --> 01:02:27.089
All right, let's go!

1515
01:02:28.330 --> 01:02:29.360
This will be very hard.

1516
01:02:29.730 --> 01:02:31.259
- Shall we get on our knees now? - Yes.

1517
01:02:31.259 --> 01:02:33.230
- Just one knee. - On the count of three, guys.

1518
01:02:33.230 --> 01:02:34.259
I'll just use my one knee.

1519
01:02:34.429 --> 01:02:36.699
- What? No, you have to use both. - I'll just use on knee.

1520
01:02:36.699 --> 01:02:38.440
You have to use both. Your knees get cold too.

1521
01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:39.839
- Really? - Use both.

1522
01:02:39.839 --> 01:02:41.239
- Both knees, okay? - Got it.

1523
01:02:41.409 --> 01:02:42.869
- Both knees. - Both knees like this.

1524
01:02:43.170 --> 01:02:45.679
- Gosh. - See? Even your knees feel cold.

1525
01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:48.909
(Their knees feel cold even though they're wearing pants.)

1526
01:02:48.909 --> 01:02:50.049
All right, here we go.

1527
01:02:50.850 --> 01:02:52.580
Bring your face close to the snow. All right, guys.

1528
01:02:52.580 --> 01:02:55.219
- My gosh! - Ready? Here we go! Let's do this!

1529
01:02:56.650 --> 01:02:59.060
(They're doing it, but...)

1530
01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:00.690
- What are we doing now? - Here we go!

1531
01:03:00.690 --> 01:03:03.230
(Why are we doing this right now?)

1532
01:03:03.489 --> 01:03:05.060
Here we go! Let's do this!

1533
01:03:05.830 --> 01:03:08.130
(Here we go!)

1534
01:03:08.730 --> 01:03:10.569
- 1... - 1, 2, 3!

1535
01:03:17.239 --> 01:03:20.480
(Their faces are buried in snow.)

1536
01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:29.520
(Screaming)

1537
01:03:43.699 --> 01:03:46.799
(It feels like minus 30°C.)

1538
01:03:46.799 --> 01:03:49.569
(Their faces probably feel like minus 80°C now.)

1539
01:03:54.610 --> 01:03:56.009
Get up already!

1540
01:03:56.009 --> 01:03:57.250
Can someone please get up?

1541
01:03:57.250 --> 01:03:59.350
I think this is a very bad idea!

1542
01:04:01.589 --> 01:04:02.790
Get up!

1543
01:04:02.850 --> 01:04:06.290
(The intolerable pain)

1544
01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:07.860
Get up!

1545
01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:09.489
(It's making them go crazy.)

1546
01:04:11.730 --> 01:04:14.000
(Except for Sang Yun)

1547
01:04:15.699 --> 01:04:18.569
(What are they doing now?)

1548
01:04:18.569 --> 01:04:21.270
- Here we go! 1, 2, 3! - 1, 2...

1549
01:04:22.339 --> 01:04:24.810
(While the 3 of them were buried in the snow and couldn't see,)

1550
01:04:24.810 --> 01:04:27.839
(Sang Yun was quietly watching them.)

1551
01:04:33.679 --> 01:04:36.650
(He's conflicted.)

1552
01:04:39.119 --> 01:04:41.790
(They say that nothing is impossible...)

1553
01:04:41.790 --> 01:04:44.089
(when you set your mind to it.)

1554
01:04:44.089 --> 01:04:45.100
Get up already!

1555
01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:51.199
(That can-do attitude can make you go crazy in the snow like this.)

1556
01:04:53.369 --> 01:04:54.369
Please!

1557
01:04:55.770 --> 01:04:57.610
Seung Gi, please get up.

1558
01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:03.650
(No matter how hard Se Hyeong tries to push him,)

1559
01:05:03.650 --> 01:05:06.679
(he won't even budge.)

1560
01:05:07.549 --> 01:05:08.690
(He tries throwing snow at him.)

1561
01:05:08.690 --> 01:05:09.719
Get up.

1562
01:05:10.549 --> 01:05:12.589
(But it doesn't work.)

1563
01:05:13.060 --> 01:05:14.659
- Seung Gi, please get up! - Get up already!

1564
01:05:14.659 --> 01:05:16.960
(The more they tolerate it and suffer in pain,)

1565
01:05:18.730 --> 01:05:21.969
(the guiltier Sang Yun feels.)

1566
01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.000
(What should I do?)

1567
01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.139
Hey, get up already!

1568
01:05:26.139 --> 01:05:28.139
(I guess I should just dunk my face in the snow now.)

1569
01:05:34.380 --> 01:05:35.449
You guys are not dead, right?

1570
01:05:39.949 --> 01:05:40.980
(Se Hyeong gives up after 52 seconds.)

1571
01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:42.020
Get up now!

1572
01:05:44.350 --> 01:05:46.790
Guys, get up. You can all get up now.

1573
01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:52.400
(Seong Jae gets up.)

1574
01:06:00.139 --> 01:06:01.139
(Screaming)

1575
01:06:01.139 --> 01:06:03.040
(He can't even pronounce properly.)

1576
01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:05.239
(Everyone got up.)

1577
01:06:08.750 --> 01:06:12.619
(I didn't die!)

1578
01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:15.020
(My gosh!)

1579
01:06:22.989 --> 01:06:26.130
(I can't even close my mouth.)

1580
01:06:29.069 --> 01:06:31.230
(Roaring)

1581
01:06:31.230 --> 01:06:34.400
(This one is calm.)

1582
01:06:35.569 --> 01:06:36.869
Se Hyeong, this is really...

1583
01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:40.239
(I must've been out of my mind.)

1584
01:06:40.239 --> 01:06:42.710
(Why on earth did I suggest playing this game?)

1585
01:06:44.279 --> 01:06:46.350
(I really can't close my mouth.)

1586
01:06:46.350 --> 01:06:47.380
Gosh, hold on.

1587
01:06:47.719 --> 01:06:48.719
My jaw is making a weird sound.

1588
01:06:48.719 --> 01:06:50.889
(I think my jaw is making a weird sound.)

1589
01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:56.560
(Is my mouth frozen?)

1590
01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:03.100
(Looking at how much pain they're in,)

1591
01:07:03.100 --> 01:07:05.239
(a wave of guilt surges up in Sang Yun's heart.)

1592
01:07:05.469 --> 01:07:07.440
I don't think my cheekbones are moving. Are they moving?

1593
01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:08.440
(Is my face paralyzed now?)

1594
01:07:12.210 --> 01:07:14.279
Wait, I don't think I can move my jaw.

1595
01:07:14.949 --> 01:07:16.480
(That's my cheekbone.)

1596
01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:17.480
My jaw isn't moving.

1597
01:07:19.279 --> 01:07:21.279
(I'm sorry, guys.)

1598
01:07:21.850 --> 01:07:23.949
That was like doing a facial treatment with snow.

1599
01:07:24.650 --> 01:07:27.259
Look at this. My face totally went in there.

1600
01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:30.529
(His tightly closed eyes and his lips that were shivering in cold)

1601
01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:34.360
While my face was buried in the snow...

1602
01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:36.500
Didn't you guys also feel the fear of death?

1603
01:07:37.270 --> 01:07:39.670
I was overwhelmed by the fear. I've never played a game like this.

1604
01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:42.310
I'm so impressed that all of us tolerated the pain for that long.

1605
01:07:42.310 --> 01:07:45.239
But I feel refreshed now that I'm out of the snow.

1606
01:07:45.310 --> 01:07:47.540
- Doesn't your skin feel firmer? - Yes, a little.

1607
01:07:47.540 --> 01:07:49.779
- Right now, I feel... - My skin feels much firmer.

1608
01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:51.380
It feels so firm.

1609
01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:54.480
(This guy can't relate to what they're talking about.)

1610
01:07:55.250 --> 01:07:56.449
Did you have it underneath?

1611
01:07:56.449 --> 01:07:57.489
Did you, Sang Yun?

1612
01:07:57.489 --> 01:07:59.860
(He even feels bad about getting the towel.)

1613
01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:02.290
Look at this. You can see my facial features.

1614
01:08:02.290 --> 01:08:03.630
(What should I do? Shall I come clean?)

1615
01:08:03.630 --> 01:08:04.830
This game is really crazy.

1616
01:08:06.159 --> 01:08:08.369
Anyway, you lost.

1617
01:08:08.369 --> 01:08:09.429
(He has to sleep beside the master.)

1618
01:08:09.429 --> 01:08:11.440
- It's Se Hyeong! - You'll wash his feet,

1619
01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:15.040
sing him a lullaby, and do a facial mask with him in matching pajamas.

1620
01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:16.339
I can't play another round of this.

1621
01:08:16.409 --> 01:08:18.610
I absolutely can't. Don't even think about suggesting another round.

1622
01:08:18.739 --> 01:08:19.739
I'm serious.

1623
01:08:19.779 --> 01:08:21.239
If you do, it might turn into a fight.

1624
01:08:21.850 --> 01:08:22.880
That's just not happening.

1625
01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:25.049
(Seeing Se Hyeong all downcast, Sang Yun feels...)

1626
01:08:25.779 --> 01:08:28.150
(Sang Yun, just tell them the truth. You're a good person.)

1627
01:08:28.150 --> 01:08:29.320
Sang Yun, was it okay for you?

1628
01:08:29.919 --> 01:08:31.150
It obviously wasn't okay.

1629
01:08:31.919 --> 01:08:34.990
All right, guys. Let's play it for real now.

1630
01:08:35.190 --> 01:08:36.230
What?

1631
01:08:36.230 --> 01:08:38.759
(What's he saying?)

1632
01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:43.799
To tell you the truth, I didn't have my face in the snow the whole time.

1633
01:08:43.799 --> 01:08:45.440
(Sang Yun came clean.)

1634
01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:50.270
(What on earth is he saying now?)

1635
01:08:52.509 --> 01:08:54.110
Sorry? What do you mean?

1636
01:08:54.110 --> 01:08:56.110
(He didn't do it the whole time?)

1637
01:08:56.879 --> 01:08:58.320
I was just watching you guys.

1638
01:08:59.249 --> 01:09:01.789
Seriously? Is he being serious now?

1639
01:09:02.850 --> 01:09:04.150
- Seriously? - I can't lie.

1640
01:09:04.150 --> 01:09:06.089
(We can't believe this.)

1641
01:09:06.389 --> 01:09:07.419
What?

1642
01:09:09.329 --> 01:09:11.700
I can't lie because I feel too guilty. I'm sorry, guys.

1643
01:09:13.259 --> 01:09:14.629
What do you think you're doing now?

1644
01:09:15.169 --> 01:09:16.570
I thought that's how it's done on variety shows.

1645
01:09:16.629 --> 01:09:18.870
I glanced at you guys and saw that you guys all did it.

1646
01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:22.610
I didn't dunk my face because I thought you guys might fool me.

1647
01:09:22.810 --> 01:09:26.339
- Gosh, this is... - You've been fooling me all along.

1648
01:09:27.780 --> 01:09:31.620
(We have fooled you many times.)

1649
01:09:32.379 --> 01:09:34.650
(You guys lied to me and said that I'd be the master.)

1650
01:09:36.089 --> 01:09:38.120
(And that prank about a random strand of hair...)

1651
01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:40.990
(almost gave me a heart attack.)

1652
01:09:42.289 --> 01:09:45.400
(Then you guys made me jump all by myself.)

1653
01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:48.169
- What is this? - Ready? Here we go. Let's do this!

1654
01:09:48.169 --> 01:09:49.669
- 1, 2, 3. - 1, 2...

1655
01:09:49.669 --> 01:09:51.870
(I made a solemn promise to myself...)

1656
01:09:52.969 --> 01:09:55.639
(that I won't let you guys fool me ever again.)

1657
01:09:57.509 --> 01:09:59.610
I didn't dunk my face because I thought you guys might fool me.

1658
01:10:00.509 --> 01:10:02.150
(We do understand it, but...)

1659
01:10:02.150 --> 01:10:03.350
That's why you were...

1660
01:10:03.509 --> 01:10:05.419
I can't even say anything because I'm utterly shocked.

1661
01:10:05.650 --> 01:10:08.150
How are supposed to accept this?

1662
01:10:08.820 --> 01:10:10.919
Wait, you didn't do it either?

1663
01:10:10.919 --> 01:10:13.560
What are you talking about? My makeup is imprinted on the snow.

1664
01:10:14.190 --> 01:10:15.360
- But it's... - You're telling the truth, right?

1665
01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:17.030
Yes, of course. I totally did it.

1666
01:10:17.589 --> 01:10:19.230
I saw everything. All three of you did it.

1667
01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:21.499
(Gosh, that guy...)

1668
01:10:21.499 --> 01:10:23.100
- Goodness, this is... - Let's play it for real now.

1669
01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:25.700
- All three of you did it. - How long did we do it for?

1670
01:10:26.570 --> 01:10:28.039
First, keep your face in the snow for 52 seconds.

1671
01:10:28.709 --> 01:10:31.209
- You need to experience it. - I thought my face was paralyzed.

1672
01:10:31.209 --> 01:10:33.209
You have to feel what it's really like...

1673
01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:36.009
to be able to understand why we've been going on about it.

1674
01:10:36.209 --> 01:10:38.650
I thought my face was going to be paralyzed. I'm serious.

1675
01:10:38.950 --> 01:10:42.120
You need to endure that 52 seconds for us to play another round.

1676
01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:43.320
- No, no. Sang Yun. - Only then...

1677
01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:45.490
(You must endure it for us to move on to another round.)

1678
01:10:45.690 --> 01:10:47.520
- No, we can't do that. - Why? What's the problem?

1679
01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:49.789
Technically, you came in dead last.

1680
01:10:50.289 --> 01:10:51.860
- That's right. - We shouldn't have to play again.

1681
01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:55.700
What matters is whether Sang Yun can endure 52 seconds or not.

1682
01:10:55.770 --> 01:10:57.730
Gosh, how ruthless. We're in this together, you know.

1683
01:10:57.730 --> 01:10:59.400
- What are you talking about? - Hey, listen.

1684
01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:01.410
- What I mean is... - That has nothing to do with this.

1685
01:11:01.410 --> 01:11:02.570
What I mean is...

1686
01:11:02.570 --> 01:11:03.940
- we're doing this because... - I'm out!

1687
01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:05.810
Hey, Seong Jae threw that thing.

1688
01:11:06.009 --> 01:11:07.910
It's between the two of you now.

1689
01:11:07.940 --> 01:11:09.249
It's a great chance for you.

1690
01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:11.450
It means that you can still get out of it.

1691
01:11:11.450 --> 01:11:14.379
Hey, he can even tolerate all of his hair being pulled out.

1692
01:11:14.679 --> 01:11:15.919
How am I supposed to beat him?

1693
01:11:16.289 --> 01:11:17.490
You have no choice now.

1694
01:11:17.490 --> 01:11:19.789
Anyway, first off... Regardless of what we decide to do,

1695
01:11:19.789 --> 01:11:21.789
let's first have Sang Yun bury his face in the snow for 52 seconds.

1696
01:11:21.929 --> 01:11:23.230
- No, Se Hyeong. - This game is going nowhere.

1697
01:11:23.230 --> 01:11:24.730
Seong Jae and I don't have to do it again.

1698
01:11:24.730 --> 01:11:26.700
- Okay, I heard you. Be quiet now. - We're...

1699
01:11:26.759 --> 01:11:29.270
Sang Yun, you'll have to keep your face in the snow for 52 seconds.

1700
01:11:29.270 --> 01:11:32.240
- We're being so childish. - We'll figure it out after that.

1701
01:11:32.870 --> 01:11:34.370
- All right. - This is definitely...

1702
01:11:34.370 --> 01:11:36.669
one of the most painful games I've ever played.

1703
01:11:36.669 --> 01:11:38.339
- Sang Yun, do it here. - Se Hyeong...

1704
01:11:38.339 --> 01:11:40.310
No, you have to do it here. On freshly piled up snow.

1705
01:11:42.780 --> 01:11:44.749
Sang Yun, you should dunk your face right in, okay?

1706
01:11:46.020 --> 01:11:47.850
I came clean because I felt too guilty.

1707
01:11:48.450 --> 01:11:49.450
Sang Yun.

1708
01:11:49.950 --> 01:11:51.219
- For 52 seconds. - Okay.

1709
01:11:51.419 --> 01:11:53.490
We'll start at the moment you go down.

1710
01:11:53.789 --> 01:11:54.829
Get ready.

1711
01:11:56.589 --> 01:11:57.589
Get ready.

1712
01:11:57.759 --> 01:11:59.629
(Feel the pain, Sang Yun.)

1713
01:11:59.629 --> 01:12:00.660
- Like this. - Yes.

1714
01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:03.070
(Why do we have to do this?)

1715
01:12:03.370 --> 01:12:05.200
- Go deeper. - Good.

1716
01:12:05.740 --> 01:12:06.740
Go.

1717
01:12:06.969 --> 01:12:09.070
(Diving into snow)

1718
01:12:09.070 --> 01:12:10.370
Okay. That's it.

1719
01:12:11.039 --> 01:12:12.509
(Sang Yun's pain...)

1720
01:12:12.509 --> 01:12:14.009
(is our happiness.)

1721
01:12:14.009 --> 01:12:16.379
- It's going to kill him. - It's killing.

1722
01:12:16.379 --> 01:12:19.719
It starts to get warm then cold.

1723
01:12:19.719 --> 01:12:20.749
(Half face and half snow)

1724
01:12:24.150 --> 01:12:26.190
He's tough. He doesn't even move.

1725
01:12:28.089 --> 01:12:29.289
He didn't faint, did he?

1726
01:12:29.829 --> 01:12:32.629
- Sprouts don't grow, but needles. - Right.

1727
01:12:32.629 --> 01:12:33.629
It burns your face.

1728
01:12:34.499 --> 01:12:36.230
He's so tough.

1729
01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:39.440
(As if he's apologizing to them...)

1730
01:12:41.039 --> 01:12:42.110
He doesn't even move.

1731
01:12:43.070 --> 01:12:45.079
(He shouldn't bear it so well.)

1732
01:12:47.810 --> 01:12:49.480
- No. - Is he breathing?

1733
01:12:50.379 --> 01:12:51.950
(He's close.)

1734
01:12:53.579 --> 01:12:56.520
- Be quiet. Don't talk. - Okay.

1735
01:12:56.749 --> 01:12:58.060
He still has lots of time left.

1736
01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:00.259
He still has a lot left.

1737
01:13:01.060 --> 01:13:02.259
He's so tough.

1738
01:13:02.259 --> 01:13:03.530
(He's tough.)

1739
01:13:09.730 --> 01:13:13.039
(Will Sang Yun be able to endure 52 seconds?)

1740
01:13:18.039 --> 01:13:19.539
- You can get up now. - Time's up.

1741
01:13:21.110 --> 01:13:22.549
- You can get up now. - Time's up.

1742
01:13:25.049 --> 01:13:26.219
How was it?

1743
01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:29.150
Right. I have to see the outline.

1744
01:13:30.089 --> 01:13:32.560
(Trace of 52 seconds of endurance)

1745
01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:36.589
- I see the line. - This is no joke.

1746
01:13:36.589 --> 01:13:38.429
Do you understand why we were like that?

1747
01:13:38.499 --> 01:13:39.530
I'm sorry.

1748
01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:42.299
- I'm really sorry. - Seriously?

1749
01:13:42.429 --> 01:13:44.270
- Don't be like that, Sang Yun. - It's no joke, right?

1750
01:13:44.299 --> 01:13:47.240
- Seriously this is... - I'm really sorry.

1751
01:13:47.669 --> 01:13:49.810
This game kills people.

1752
01:13:50.169 --> 01:13:52.039
Who suggested it? Oh, it was me.

1753
01:13:52.810 --> 01:13:53.980
Gosh. It's tough.

1754
01:13:55.709 --> 01:13:57.110
My heart beats fast.

1755
01:13:57.850 --> 01:13:58.850
(My heart was beating faster.)

1756
01:13:58.850 --> 01:14:00.079
- Because... - It's no joke, isn't it?

1757
01:14:01.650 --> 01:14:03.320
My breath melts the snow,

1758
01:14:03.589 --> 01:14:05.360
and it enters my nose.

1759
01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:06.360
- I know. - Yes.

1760
01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:07.690
(You didn't experience it alone.)

1761
01:14:07.690 --> 01:14:08.860
- Then now... - It's no joke.

1762
01:14:10.060 --> 01:14:11.759
(We know.)

1763
01:14:12.259 --> 01:14:13.259
- Then now... - It's no joke.

1764
01:14:13.259 --> 01:14:14.259
(Since Sang Yun endured it...)

1765
01:14:14.259 --> 01:14:15.469
You two can decide.

1766
01:14:15.999 --> 01:14:17.329
No. All four of us should do it.

1767
01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:19.740
Right. All of us should do it.

1768
01:14:19.740 --> 01:14:21.370
- You won. - Then you...

1769
01:14:21.610 --> 01:14:23.709
- Seong Jae. Let me be clear. - You endured it for 55 seconds.

1770
01:14:23.709 --> 01:14:25.139
When someone does...

1771
01:14:25.410 --> 01:14:27.709
something wrong in the game,

1772
01:14:27.709 --> 01:14:29.879
we start over.

1773
01:14:29.879 --> 01:14:30.879
Right.

1774
01:14:31.820 --> 01:14:33.249
- Right. - Hey.

1775
01:14:33.249 --> 01:14:35.820
- I'm not arguing, Seung Gi. - Right.

1776
01:14:35.820 --> 01:14:39.060
It'll be no fun if just two of us decide it.

1777
01:14:39.060 --> 01:14:40.719
- Right. - Then it's invalid.

1778
01:14:40.719 --> 01:14:42.129
It's not invalid.

1779
01:14:42.129 --> 01:14:43.690
You cheated on your will.

1780
01:14:43.690 --> 01:14:46.060
- But he confessed on his will. - What?

1781
01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:47.829
(But he confessed on his will.)

1782
01:14:48.100 --> 01:14:49.100
What?

1783
01:14:49.469 --> 01:14:51.299
(He makes a point.)

1784
01:14:51.299 --> 01:14:52.499
It evens out.

1785
01:14:52.870 --> 01:14:53.870
- It's even. - He's right.

1786
01:14:53.870 --> 01:14:55.370
I could go for longer.

1787
01:14:55.370 --> 01:14:56.539
I can do it for three minutes.

1788
01:14:56.610 --> 01:14:58.240
If you do it for three minutes, I'll do it all.

1789
01:14:58.240 --> 01:14:59.339
(I'll take three minutes, and I'm going all in.)

1790
01:14:59.339 --> 01:15:00.339
- I'm serious. - No.

1791
01:15:00.339 --> 01:15:01.610
- I'm just saying. - If you do it for three minutes,

1792
01:15:01.610 --> 01:15:03.610
you take all the pay for this week.

1793
01:15:03.749 --> 01:15:06.020
I don't need anything, so do whatever you want.

1794
01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:08.450
(I'm here to end this battle.)

1795
01:15:08.450 --> 01:15:10.549
(But it's way too cold.)

1796
01:15:10.549 --> 01:15:13.620
(Heavy snow)

1797
01:15:13.620 --> 01:15:15.589
(There's a heavy snow fall warning.)

1798
01:15:16.129 --> 01:15:17.389
(The road is gone.)

1799
01:15:17.389 --> 01:15:19.329
(They're isolated in the room.)

1800
01:15:19.329 --> 01:15:20.829
(Wise room life in Gangwon Province)

1801
01:15:21.370 --> 01:15:23.629
(Members are not used to being isolated.)

1802
01:15:23.629 --> 01:15:24.629
(What do we do now?)

1803
01:15:24.969 --> 01:15:26.700
(What's that sound?)

1804
01:15:26.799 --> 01:15:29.770
(The master's cry fills the room.)

1805
01:15:29.770 --> 01:15:31.410
(Even when they're isolated,)

1806
01:15:31.410 --> 01:15:33.339
(they're busy playing random games with the master.)

1807
01:15:33.679 --> 01:15:34.709
(Don't let your guard down.)

1808
01:15:35.249 --> 01:15:36.480
(You may become the target.)

1809
01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:37.980
(Even the master too.)

1810
01:15:37.980 --> 01:15:39.219
(Wise...)

1811
01:15:39.219 --> 01:15:40.350
(Alcoholic...)

1812
01:15:40.350 --> 01:15:42.950
(room life with the master)

1813
01:15:43.450 --> 01:15:44.549
I think it's salty.

1814
01:15:44.759 --> 01:15:50.030
