00:00:04.932 --> 00:00:06.303
(All the characters, organizations, places, and happenings...)

2
00:00:06.303 --> 00:00:07.603
(in this drama are all fake and are not based on a true story.)

3
00:00:19.246 --> 00:00:20.347
I'll give you everything,

4
00:00:21.147 --> 00:00:22.446
so just end it now.

5
00:00:23.847 --> 00:00:25.047
Just end it. Once and for all.

6
00:00:26.716 --> 00:00:28.617
That's exactly what I'm hoping to do.

7
00:00:29.887 --> 00:00:31.487
I'm doing this so that I can put things to an end.

8
00:00:31.656 --> 00:00:33.296
How can you even call yourself a human being?

9
00:00:34.527 --> 00:00:37.496
Since when did you know that...

10
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:41.496
Kim Jong Sam's your son?

11
00:00:50.006 --> 00:00:51.046
Chul Gi.

12
00:01:03.557 --> 00:01:04.587
What do you mean?

13
00:01:07.697 --> 00:01:09.027
I'm whose son?

14
00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:18.936
What kind of nonsense is that?

15
00:01:29.346 --> 00:01:30.387
This is crazy.

16
00:02:06.686 --> 00:02:08.516
Jong Sam! Jong...

17
00:02:24.866 --> 00:02:27.176
I was really busy with work.

18
00:02:27.606 --> 00:02:29.377
And Detective Kang suddenly came to see me.

19
00:02:29.477 --> 00:02:31.576
I figured I should offer him a cup of tea.

20
00:02:31.576 --> 00:02:33.747
So after I poured in hot water,

21
00:02:34.317 --> 00:02:36.016
I turned around, but he was gone.

22
00:02:36.247 --> 00:02:37.817
And the evidence was gone too.

23
00:02:40.917 --> 00:02:43.217
- My gosh. - Did you meet Chul Gi...

24
00:02:45.026 --> 00:02:46.757
Why do you have this?

25
00:02:48.926 --> 00:02:50.326
Where did you get this?

26
00:02:50.796 --> 00:02:51.826
Hey.

27
00:02:52.567 --> 00:02:53.597
Hey.

28
00:02:54.336 --> 00:02:58.537
No one directly touched this evidence, right? My gosh.

29
00:03:01.576 --> 00:03:04.546
- I'm sorry. - That's not going to cut it.

30
00:03:04.847 --> 00:03:08.646
I don't know what happened, but you broke the rules.

31
00:03:09.576 --> 00:03:12.516
Nothing happened to this, right? Is everything fine?

32
00:03:12.516 --> 00:03:13.757
It's perfectly fine.

33
00:03:14.417 --> 00:03:16.826
I'm sorry. I have nothing to say.

34
00:03:17.257 --> 00:03:19.056
I'm busy, so I'm going to go now.

35
00:03:19.586 --> 00:03:22.056
Get all the details of the case,

36
00:03:22.157 --> 00:03:23.366
and report them to me.

37
00:03:23.727 --> 00:03:25.667
Yes, sir. Take care, sir.

38
00:03:27.067 --> 00:03:28.296
What are you doing?

39
00:03:29.697 --> 00:03:32.236
And you. What are you two doing?

40
00:03:34.637 --> 00:03:35.706
Kang Chul Gi.

41
00:03:36.706 --> 00:03:38.646
It wasn't easy to get that proof.

42
00:03:39.146 --> 00:03:40.917
Why did you take that?

43
00:03:41.146 --> 00:03:43.217
Why? Tell me.

44
00:03:43.217 --> 00:03:44.287
Lieutenant Jin.

45
00:03:44.347 --> 00:03:45.516
Tell me!

46
00:03:45.516 --> 00:03:48.757
Lieutenant Jin. Calm down. Let's hear him out.

47
00:03:49.956 --> 00:03:50.956
What happened?

48
00:03:51.326 --> 00:03:52.326
It's because of me.

49
00:03:54.727 --> 00:03:56.056
It's all because of me.

50
00:03:57.667 --> 00:03:58.727
So drop it.

51
00:04:10.076 --> 00:04:11.146
I'm sorry.

52
00:04:11.146 --> 00:04:12.606
Why did you do something you'd be sorry for?

53
00:04:13.247 --> 00:04:15.516
What was the reason? What did you do with it?

54
00:04:17.646 --> 00:04:18.947
I met Lee Kwang Ho.

55
00:04:19.187 --> 00:04:21.456
Lee Kwang Ho? Why?

56
00:04:22.416 --> 00:04:24.987
I got his phone call.

57
00:04:26.257 --> 00:04:27.297
Be careful.

58
00:04:35.197 --> 00:04:36.197
Hello.

59
00:04:36.867 --> 00:04:38.406
Bring Kim Jong Sam to me.

60
00:04:38.706 --> 00:04:39.836
Who?

61
00:04:39.867 --> 00:04:41.206
Kim Jong Sam.

62
00:04:42.107 --> 00:04:44.976
If you two keep digging information on me and Jong Sam's mom,

63
00:04:44.976 --> 00:04:46.047
he'll find out eventually.

64
00:04:46.646 --> 00:04:48.117
Why don't I just tell him first?

65
00:04:48.447 --> 00:04:49.447
You...

66
00:04:51.416 --> 00:04:54.216
What are you talking about?

67
00:04:55.656 --> 00:04:57.526
That I'm Jong Sam's dad.

68
00:05:00.627 --> 00:05:01.656
Why?

69
00:05:01.857 --> 00:05:03.697
Do you think he'll get hurt if he finds out?

70
00:05:05.427 --> 00:05:08.396
Then bring the Odong Blowfish House evidence.

71
00:05:10.166 --> 00:05:13.336
If you won't, I'll meet with Jong Sam.

72
00:05:13.476 --> 00:05:15.237
He'll be miserable if he knows the truth.

73
00:05:15.576 --> 00:05:17.107
I won't be the miserable one.

74
00:05:20.076 --> 00:05:22.947
I could only think of one thing.

75
00:05:23.447 --> 00:05:25.117
"Jong Sam can't know about it."

76
00:05:26.117 --> 00:05:28.716
"He'll be crushed if he finds out that his father..."

77
00:05:28.716 --> 00:05:32.026
"killed his mother, and tried to kill him too."

78
00:05:36.127 --> 00:05:37.427
Is Jong Sam really his son?

79
00:05:38.367 --> 00:05:39.596
It must be true.

80
00:05:39.627 --> 00:05:42.536
So you went to Lee Kwang Ho with the evidence?

81
00:05:42.737 --> 00:05:44.607
I went there thinking that...

82
00:05:45.307 --> 00:05:46.637
I should stop him.

83
00:05:48.836 --> 00:05:50.377
Jong Sam was already there.

84
00:05:53.377 --> 00:05:57.216
So he was there to get Lee Kwang Ho's DNA.

85
00:05:57.887 --> 00:05:59.887
I went there to stop Lee Kwang Ho,

86
00:06:01.317 --> 00:06:02.586
but I ended up telling...

87
00:06:08.456 --> 00:06:10.166
Let me ask Inspector Cho a favor.

88
00:06:11.726 --> 00:06:15.137
Jong Sam's DNA must be on the evidence.

89
00:06:15.966 --> 00:06:18.007
If Lee Kwang Ho is the real killer,

90
00:06:18.437 --> 00:06:21.107
his DNA would be on the evidence.

91
00:06:21.607 --> 00:06:24.877
If we look at the results we'll know if Jong Sam is...

92
00:06:24.976 --> 00:06:26.617
Lee Kwang Ho's real son.

93
00:06:27.976 --> 00:06:32.117
The Odong Blowfish House evidence is 10 years old.

94
00:06:32.786 --> 00:06:35.857
Plus it could've been contaminated as it was passed on from...

95
00:06:35.987 --> 00:06:37.956
Jang Pil Sung to the Hidden Crime Team.

96
00:06:38.586 --> 00:06:41.927
You're saying if we make those claims, it won't be a problem?

97
00:06:42.127 --> 00:06:43.266
We can argue...

98
00:06:43.666 --> 00:06:46.737
that it isn't direct evidence to prove that Ms. Hong was killed,

99
00:06:46.737 --> 00:06:48.896
I mean, that it resulted in Ms. Hong's death.

100
00:06:49.137 --> 00:06:51.567
So you're saying we should argue...

101
00:06:51.937 --> 00:06:54.076
that it's not admissible as evidence.

102
00:06:54.377 --> 00:06:58.107
Is there anything I should know about...

103
00:06:58.107 --> 00:07:00.576
that makes you related to Ms. Hong's murder case?

104
00:07:01.617 --> 00:07:05.047
Are you asking me if I killed her?

105
00:07:05.747 --> 00:07:07.286
No, sir.

106
00:07:08.086 --> 00:07:12.487
I'm asking just in case I need to come up with a strategy.

107
00:07:14.226 --> 00:07:16.867
There's nothing like that. You may leave.

108
00:07:17.726 --> 00:07:18.726
Yes, sir.

109
00:07:29.177 --> 00:07:30.906
I don't think...

110
00:07:32.007 --> 00:07:34.447
a murderer like you should become a president.

111
00:07:36.177 --> 00:07:37.487
There is no proof,

112
00:07:39.047 --> 00:07:40.187
but you killed...

113
00:07:42.987 --> 00:07:44.326
Choi Yeon Mi.

114
00:07:48.627 --> 00:07:50.867
Yeon Mi and I are from the same orphanage.

115
00:07:51.797 --> 00:07:53.026
We were...

116
00:07:54.336 --> 00:07:55.367
friends.

117
00:07:56.666 --> 00:08:00.776
Yeon Mi told me about you a long time ago.

118
00:08:02.536 --> 00:08:04.076
I recorded that.

119
00:08:05.276 --> 00:08:07.476
To get child support from you.

120
00:08:08.646 --> 00:08:12.146
But Yeon Mi was too nice. She asked me not to do that.

121
00:08:12.447 --> 00:08:14.216
So I left it at that.

122
00:08:15.057 --> 00:08:16.156
But just now,

123
00:08:17.357 --> 00:08:18.826
I gave the recording to Chairman Jin.

124
00:08:20.726 --> 00:08:22.526
If it gets released,

125
00:08:23.297 --> 00:08:25.067
I will give an interview...

126
00:08:25.867 --> 00:08:27.666
with her son.

127
00:08:29.966 --> 00:08:31.367
Where is he?

128
00:08:33.577 --> 00:08:34.936
I won't tell you.

129
00:08:36.536 --> 00:08:37.806
Because I'm the only one...

130
00:08:38.847 --> 00:08:40.577
in the world who knows that secret.

131
00:09:17.186 --> 00:09:18.217
Park Eun Sung.

132
00:09:20.156 --> 00:09:21.487
(Donations)

133
00:09:21.487 --> 00:09:22.587
Park Eun Sung.

134
00:09:24.056 --> 00:09:25.186
Eunsung Church?

135
00:09:27.257 --> 00:09:28.357
Eunsung Church?

136
00:09:28.526 --> 00:09:31.026
I transferred money to Park Eun Sung every month.

137
00:09:32.097 --> 00:09:33.566
Yes, Eunsung Church.

138
00:09:34.196 --> 00:09:35.837
I think I heard Eunsung Church.

139
00:09:36.266 --> 00:09:39.237
So this place is Eunsung Church?

140
00:09:39.237 --> 00:09:41.536
We'll have a definite answer if we ask Mr. Choi.

141
00:09:42.036 --> 00:09:44.077
I'll check with my information team too.

142
00:09:44.806 --> 00:09:47.577
Are you using that excuse to leave right now?

143
00:09:47.717 --> 00:09:51.046
What do you mean excuse? You don't have an arrest warrant.

144
00:09:51.186 --> 00:09:52.946
I've done my work, so I'm leaving.

145
00:09:55.087 --> 00:09:57.186
Okay, I'll let you go for now.

146
00:09:58.227 --> 00:09:59.257
But...

147
00:10:04.566 --> 00:10:05.727
She's so rude.

148
00:10:14.737 --> 00:10:15.776
This is Kim Yoon Su.

149
00:10:16.847 --> 00:10:17.977
Of course.

150
00:10:18.847 --> 00:10:21.446
Yes. Please take care of that. Thank you.

151
00:10:24.646 --> 00:10:25.686
You're back.

152
00:10:27.156 --> 00:10:28.156
Did you find them?

153
00:10:28.556 --> 00:10:31.727
There is no trace of Manager Kwak and Manager Ki.

154
00:10:32.186 --> 00:10:33.227
Maybe...

155
00:10:34.257 --> 00:10:36.827
they ran away knowing that we were coming.

156
00:10:37.396 --> 00:10:40.237
They abducted Jang Pil Sung and locked him in a trunk.

157
00:10:40.436 --> 00:10:41.637
So they can't get caught.

158
00:10:41.637 --> 00:10:45.337
Prosecutor Kim got information from Chairwoman Gook...

159
00:10:45.436 --> 00:10:48.906
and requested for our assistance. They must've known.

160
00:10:49.036 --> 00:10:50.776
Where Jang Pil Sung?

161
00:10:50.877 --> 00:10:53.977
He's in the lockup, and he's pleading the fifth.

162
00:10:54.676 --> 00:10:56.617
Still, we secured evidence.

163
00:10:57.946 --> 00:10:58.987
Officer Oh did.

164
00:10:59.046 --> 00:11:01.286
- Nice. - Nice.

165
00:11:02.686 --> 00:11:04.387
Stop it.

166
00:11:07.227 --> 00:11:08.696
I'll be leaving first.

167
00:11:08.926 --> 00:11:10.396
Okay.

168
00:11:12.627 --> 00:11:14.137
You've done well.

169
00:11:14.666 --> 00:11:15.696
Get home safe.

170
00:11:28.217 --> 00:11:29.316
Let's go.

171
00:11:45.967 --> 00:11:48.666
Turn off the light. It hurts my head.

172
00:11:56.747 --> 00:11:57.806
Jong Sam.

173
00:11:57.906 --> 00:11:59.306
Cut to the point.

174
00:12:00.077 --> 00:12:01.416
What you heard is all I know.

175
00:12:03.077 --> 00:12:05.646
I heard that from Lee Kwnag Ho right before you did.

176
00:12:06.516 --> 00:12:09.587
As soon as I found out, I didn't want you to know.

177
00:12:10.526 --> 00:12:11.987
I wanted to bury it once and for all.

178
00:12:13.056 --> 00:12:14.957
So I went there to hand over the evidence.

179
00:12:18.097 --> 00:12:19.566
But you were there.

180
00:12:20.936 --> 00:12:22.097
So...

181
00:12:25.036 --> 00:12:26.166
it's true.

182
00:12:27.877 --> 00:12:28.906
Probably.

183
00:12:30.107 --> 00:12:31.847
Did Ms. Hong know...

184
00:12:32.577 --> 00:12:33.676
who I was?

185
00:12:37.247 --> 00:12:38.887
She probably heard it from my mom.

186
00:12:40.457 --> 00:12:41.887
Because they were close friends.

187
00:12:46.457 --> 00:12:48.757
You can leave. I want to sleep.

188
00:12:49.627 --> 00:12:50.926
I'll turn on the heat for you.

189
00:12:51.166 --> 00:12:53.127
Chul Gi, just leave.

190
00:12:57.637 --> 00:12:58.707
I'm tired.

191
00:13:00.306 --> 00:13:01.306
Okay.

192
00:14:30.827 --> 00:14:32.566
(The Mill)

193
00:14:47.776 --> 00:14:48.847
Hey.

194
00:15:00.997 --> 00:15:02.957
My gosh, what's going on?

195
00:15:11.936 --> 00:15:13.137
You guys can go.

196
00:15:13.137 --> 00:15:14.137
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

197
00:15:21.977 --> 00:15:23.247
I'm here to warn you.

198
00:15:25.887 --> 00:15:28.416
I don't care who I am or who you are.

199
00:15:29.617 --> 00:15:32.056
Choi Yeon Mi, Hong Mi Ok,

200
00:15:32.686 --> 00:15:35.896
Jin Jung Gil, Oh Il Seung,

201
00:15:37.166 --> 00:15:38.227
and Geum Byul.

202
00:15:39.196 --> 00:15:41.997
Nothing changes the fact that you murdered them.

203
00:15:43.266 --> 00:15:44.436
I'm going to...

204
00:15:46.107 --> 00:15:47.776
bring you down.

205
00:15:49.906 --> 00:15:51.577
If I can't do that by law, I'll use the press.

206
00:15:52.877 --> 00:15:56.176
If that doesn't work, I'm just going to kill you myself.

207
00:15:56.786 --> 00:15:58.916
So from now on, I hope you live every day...

208
00:15:59.316 --> 00:16:01.487
in fear and anxiety, not knowing...

209
00:16:02.387 --> 00:16:03.656
when you'll die.

210
00:16:04.426 --> 00:16:06.156
I hope you live in fear,

211
00:16:07.497 --> 00:16:08.857
not knowing how painful it's going to be.

212
00:16:11.467 --> 00:16:13.696
I hope you look forward to what you'll see...

213
00:16:16.237 --> 00:16:18.137
at the exact moment...

214
00:16:20.207 --> 00:16:21.577
of your death.

215
00:16:23.247 --> 00:16:24.607
Do you even have the power to do that?

216
00:16:24.776 --> 00:16:26.877
I'm sure I have more power than an old man like you.

217
00:16:28.347 --> 00:16:29.347
Because...

218
00:16:30.747 --> 00:16:33.387
you have so much to lose.

219

<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E35 Doubtful Victory "Is It True?"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

220
00:16:55.176 --> 00:16:57.507
How's Officer Oh doing? Does he look okay?

221
00:16:59.077 --> 00:17:01.446
I think he's doing his best to stay sane.

222
00:17:03.946 --> 00:17:06.047
I should care for him a little more.

223
00:17:06.287 --> 00:17:08.716
Yes, please do that for me.

224
00:17:09.256 --> 00:17:10.456
Call me if you need my help.

225
00:17:10.456 --> 00:17:12.357
I actually do need your help with something.

226
00:17:12.887 --> 00:17:15.696
Can you pick Kang up after school?

227
00:17:16.027 --> 00:17:17.327
And feed him too.

228
00:17:18.996 --> 00:17:20.166
I'll do it next time.

229
00:17:20.166 --> 00:17:22.097
Please make time and do it today.

230
00:17:22.496 --> 00:17:25.267
The woman who's supposed to take care of him took the day off,

231
00:17:25.267 --> 00:17:27.976
but I'm too busy today. So please do me a favor.

232
00:17:30.807 --> 00:17:33.377
Let me do it next time. I'm too caught up with Jong Sam's issue.

233
00:17:33.377 --> 00:17:35.847
I know you feel complicated right now.

234
00:17:36.587 --> 00:17:37.746
But you should take some rest.

235
00:17:38.146 --> 00:17:40.456
His school ends at 3pm. You know where his school is, right?

236
00:17:40.986 --> 00:17:42.017
See you.

237
00:17:58.906 --> 00:17:59.976
What's going on?

238
00:18:01.236 --> 00:18:04.607
Yesterday, you just left, didn't answer your phone, and weren't home.

239
00:18:05.577 --> 00:18:08.117
- What are you playing at? - What do you mean?

240
00:18:08.946 --> 00:18:10.216
Just let it go.

241
00:18:10.216 --> 00:18:11.787
Let go of what?

242
00:18:12.887 --> 00:18:15.186
I'm worried because you're acting unusual.

243
00:18:15.186 --> 00:18:16.627
Why would you worry?

244
00:18:18.287 --> 00:18:20.896
Don't waste your time worrying about me.

245
00:18:20.896 --> 00:18:23.097
How can you say that to your partner?

246
00:18:23.097 --> 00:18:26.666
I came to work on time, and I'm going to start working now.

247
00:18:30.067 --> 00:18:31.137
So what's the problem?

248
00:18:48.486 --> 00:18:50.287
Hey, Officer Oh.

249
00:18:52.256 --> 00:18:53.256
Aren't you going inside?

250
00:18:54.057 --> 00:18:56.226
- I just came out of the office. - I see.

251
00:18:57.327 --> 00:18:58.367
Where are you going?

252
00:19:08.537 --> 00:19:10.347
It belongs to Lee Kwang Ho.

253
00:19:10.347 --> 00:19:11.476
Did you steal it?

254
00:19:11.877 --> 00:19:14.476
I'm sorry. You told me not to do anything behind your back.

255
00:19:14.577 --> 00:19:15.577
But I was in a hurry.

256
00:19:15.646 --> 00:19:17.646
So you did do something behind my back.

257
00:19:19.017 --> 00:19:22.087
But stealing stuff like this should be done behind my back.

258
00:19:22.956 --> 00:19:24.426
What else could you have done?

259
00:19:24.956 --> 00:19:26.896
Unofficially speaking, I'm glad you did it.

260
00:19:27.196 --> 00:19:30.666
But as your senior, I'm going to scold you for this. Okay?

261
00:19:31.767 --> 00:19:32.797
Okay.

262
00:19:45.577 --> 00:19:47.946
I'm relieved that the mountain's still here.

263
00:19:49.746 --> 00:19:52.686
Is that where Eunsung Church was located?

264
00:19:53.956 --> 00:19:54.956
Yes.

265
00:19:58.756 --> 00:20:00.226
Do you think he'll do his job properly?

266
00:20:03.297 --> 00:20:04.396
Mr. Cha.

267
00:20:05.996 --> 00:20:07.736
Do you remember this place?

268
00:20:11.307 --> 00:20:14.406
You buried Young Min over there.

269
00:20:14.476 --> 00:20:16.077
You told me to do it, Ms. Lee.

270
00:20:16.406 --> 00:20:17.406
That's right.

271
00:20:18.406 --> 00:20:20.377
We need to find him.

272
00:20:21.317 --> 00:20:22.847
Can you remember where you buried him?

273
00:20:25.317 --> 00:20:26.347
Ms. Lee.

274
00:20:28.057 --> 00:20:29.416
Are you going somewhere?

275
00:20:31.256 --> 00:20:33.087
I need to go to Young Min's grave.

276
00:20:42.896 --> 00:20:44.537
Are you really going to follow him?

277
00:20:45.466 --> 00:20:46.736
You can leave if you want.

278
00:21:05.426 --> 00:21:07.057
Do you think he'll really remember?

279
00:21:08.396 --> 00:21:10.027
You know better than I do that...

280
00:21:10.367 --> 00:21:14.936
people always remember exactly where they buried a corpse.

281
00:21:15.466 --> 00:21:18.037
Most criminals tend to remember.

282
00:21:18.666 --> 00:21:20.637
But he's not in his right mind right now.

283
00:21:20.976 --> 00:21:22.577
Please make up your mind.

284
00:21:22.807 --> 00:21:26.047
Either help me find him or go back down and complain.

285
00:21:27.117 --> 00:21:28.176
Chairwoman Gook.

286
00:21:43.297 --> 00:21:46.067
Chairwoman Gook and Prosecutor Kim took Mr. Cha and went to...

287
00:21:46.896 --> 00:21:49.496
a place where Eunsung Church was previously located.

288
00:21:58.547 --> 00:21:59.916
I was wondering if you knew anything about it.

289
00:22:01.716 --> 00:22:03.686
Prosecutor Kim apparently went through...

290
00:22:03.686 --> 00:22:06.287
your wife's transaction records from 20 to 30 years ago.

291
00:22:06.716 --> 00:22:10.627
Regardless of what happened then, it's too late to charge me with it.

292
00:22:10.756 --> 00:22:11.887
Yes, you're right.

293
00:22:15.256 --> 00:22:16.867
How's Jang Pil Sung doing?

294
00:22:16.867 --> 00:22:18.097
He's still keeping his mouth shut.

295
00:22:18.327 --> 00:22:19.767
What good is that going to do?

296
00:22:20.067 --> 00:22:23.067
He was brazen enough to try to betray me right in front of my eyes.

297
00:22:24.107 --> 00:22:26.037
Where are his wife and kids?

298
00:22:26.607 --> 00:22:27.607
They're in Australia.

299
00:22:29.006 --> 00:22:31.906
Cut off all kinds of financial support.

300
00:22:32.676 --> 00:22:35.916
He needs to know that he wasn't the only one who was receiving help.

301
00:22:36.047 --> 00:22:37.047
Yes, sir.

302
00:22:37.146 --> 00:22:39.587
And release an article about him to the press at the right time.

303
00:22:40.357 --> 00:22:42.057
Things are still quiet...

304
00:22:42.057 --> 00:22:44.627
because the police and prosecution are turning a blind eye on him.

305
00:22:45.756 --> 00:22:47.456
But I want you to strip him naked...

306
00:22:48.396 --> 00:22:49.827
and throw him into the cold.

307
00:22:50.097 --> 00:22:51.127
Yes, sir.

308
00:22:53.297 --> 00:22:55.037
What about General Manager Kwak and Assistant Manager Ki?

309
00:23:03.037 --> 00:23:04.077
General Manager Kwak.

310
00:23:05.077 --> 00:23:06.206
General Manager Kwak.

311
00:23:07.646 --> 00:23:08.676
What?

312
00:23:09.117 --> 00:23:10.347
It's so cold.

313
00:23:11.117 --> 00:23:12.617
I think I'm going to die.

314
00:23:12.617 --> 00:23:14.256
It's not that bad.

315
00:23:16.216 --> 00:23:18.686
Hey, try to think of a way out of here.

316
00:23:19.057 --> 00:23:20.057
Try moving a little.

317
00:23:26.067 --> 00:23:27.137
I can't.

318
00:23:29.067 --> 00:23:31.966
What will happen to us? Why is it so quiet?

319
00:23:33.877 --> 00:23:35.436
Can we get out of here alive?

320
00:23:35.807 --> 00:23:38.607
Of course. Looking at the situation,

321
00:23:38.807 --> 00:23:40.077
I can tell what's happening.

322
00:23:40.617 --> 00:23:43.446
They tied us down in order to tie Chairwoman Gook down.

323
00:23:44.117 --> 00:23:46.587
She is the target, not us.

324
00:23:47.087 --> 00:23:48.787
Then is this a good thing?

325
00:23:52.527 --> 00:23:55.057
Why is it so hard to cut this off?

326
00:23:55.797 --> 00:23:58.097
That's why we've been using it to tie people.

327
00:23:58.696 --> 00:24:00.637
- Just give up. - You're right.

328
00:24:01.936 --> 00:24:05.666
By the way, do you think Chairwoman Gook knows?

329
00:24:07.406 --> 00:24:09.206
She must be looking for us, right?

330
00:24:09.537 --> 00:24:13.676
All right. We'll start from here and make our way up.

331
00:24:13.676 --> 00:24:16.216
Keep it tight. Do you understand?

332
00:24:16.246 --> 00:24:17.317
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

333
00:24:29.456 --> 00:24:31.567
(Forensics)

334
00:24:48.347 --> 00:24:49.377
Prosecutor Kim.

335
00:25:07.367 --> 00:25:08.696
What are you doing?

336
00:25:16.337 --> 00:25:18.446
He's been left here alone for too long.

337
00:25:21.317 --> 00:25:22.716
This young child was alone.

338
00:25:25.517 --> 00:25:27.887
He must've been so cold in here.

339
00:25:30.186 --> 00:25:31.986
He must've been so scared.

340
00:25:34.797 --> 00:25:36.426
All this time,

341
00:25:38.226 --> 00:25:40.867
nobody cried with him.

342
00:25:40.966 --> 00:25:42.137
He must've been...

343
00:25:43.137 --> 00:25:45.267
He must've been so lonely.

344
00:25:50.646 --> 00:25:53.946
He was only a child. He was only...

345
00:25:54.817 --> 00:25:55.877
a child.

346
00:26:07.756 --> 00:26:08.797
Young Min.

347
00:26:10.966 --> 00:26:12.027
Young Min.

348
00:26:29.646 --> 00:26:31.817
- Is the result out? - Yes, it is.

349
00:26:33.317 --> 00:26:35.857
The clipped nails from Odong Blowfish House...

350
00:26:35.857 --> 00:26:39.256
belongs to Ms. Hong.

351
00:26:39.857 --> 00:26:44.327
Officer Oh's DNA...

352
00:26:44.666 --> 00:26:45.827
was removed.

353
00:26:48.097 --> 00:26:49.966
And the extra DNA...

354
00:26:50.966 --> 00:26:53.837
found on it was confirmed as Lee Kwang Ho's.

355
00:26:54.676 --> 00:26:55.706
That's it.

356
00:26:55.976 --> 00:26:57.146
- We got him. - It's done.

357
00:26:59.976 --> 00:27:03.317
By the way, how did you get Lee Kwang Ho's DNA?

358
00:27:03.517 --> 00:27:05.047
We stole it.

359
00:27:05.246 --> 00:27:07.216
Officer Oh stole his hair.

360
00:27:09.387 --> 00:27:11.557
Hey, good job. Good work.

361
00:27:12.587 --> 00:27:14.656
Hey, he stole. You can't tell him he did a good job.

362
00:27:15.027 --> 00:27:18.726
Shouldn't we officially request Lee Kwang Ho's DNA?

363
00:27:18.827 --> 00:27:21.196
His hair was stolen illegally,

364
00:27:21.267 --> 00:27:23.067
so it won't be admissible.

365
00:27:23.166 --> 00:27:26.406
You're right. So we requested a written consent.

366
00:27:31.277 --> 00:27:32.307
Here's the consent form.

367
00:27:33.617 --> 00:27:34.777
Of course, we refuse.

368
00:27:35.676 --> 00:27:37.587
You could've just ignored it.

369
00:27:38.087 --> 00:27:40.416
Why did you bring it all the way here?

370
00:27:41.186 --> 00:27:43.017
It's not legally enforceable.

371
00:27:43.017 --> 00:27:44.587
It's just a request for cooperation.

372
00:27:46.057 --> 00:27:47.996
I think you're too naive.

373
00:27:48.226 --> 00:27:49.857
Why did you throw that?

374
00:27:50.466 --> 00:27:53.837
I came here to inform you of some matters.

375
00:27:53.837 --> 00:27:57.206
What kind of matters would that be?

376
00:27:57.607 --> 00:28:00.406
How did you secure the evidence?

377
00:28:02.377 --> 00:28:04.746
On what grounds are you saying it came from Odong Blowfish House?

378
00:28:05.877 --> 00:28:08.347
And at the scene of the crime...

379
00:28:08.347 --> 00:28:10.817
It was all written in Mr. Cha's notepad.

380
00:28:10.817 --> 00:28:13.716
How will you prove that what's written on it is true?

381
00:28:14.787 --> 00:28:16.926
Plus Mr. Cha isn't trustworthy to be a witness...

382
00:28:16.986 --> 00:28:19.956
You can say that in court.

383
00:28:20.327 --> 00:28:24.597
Do you know how much government fund is wasted on...

384
00:28:25.797 --> 00:28:27.797
You can speak nonsense quite eloquently.

385
00:28:29.297 --> 00:28:30.337
What?

386
00:28:38.877 --> 00:28:39.916
Get out.

387
00:28:40.817 --> 00:28:43.817
Nobody here will be humored by your rubbish.

388
00:28:44.716 --> 00:28:45.986
You better not cross the line.

389
00:28:48.057 --> 00:28:49.587
Right back at you, jerk.

390
00:28:51.027 --> 00:28:54.656
Officer Oh, don't cross the line.

391
00:28:54.696 --> 00:28:55.797
Okay.

392
00:29:04.736 --> 00:29:05.767
Look at him.

393
00:29:05.767 --> 00:29:08.807
You're the man, Officer Oh. Good job.

394
00:29:20.986 --> 00:29:23.156
Why do you look so down? Did someone hit you?

395
00:29:25.057 --> 00:29:26.597
An Tae Jung, that jerk, came by...

396
00:29:27.357 --> 00:29:28.456
and got on my nerves.

397
00:29:34.837 --> 00:29:36.166
Here's Jang Pil Sung's weakness.

398
00:29:38.137 --> 00:29:41.006
Use this and make him to confess he killed Chairman Jin...

399
00:29:41.137 --> 00:29:43.847
on Lee Kwang Ho's orders, and record that.

400
00:29:44.706 --> 00:29:47.017
Jang Pil Sung's testimony will have some weight.

401
00:29:48.817 --> 00:29:50.317
It's from a private detective agency.

402
00:29:50.486 --> 00:29:53.686
It lists every corruption committed by him and his family.

403
00:29:54.456 --> 00:29:56.317
Discuss it with Inspector Park.

404
00:29:56.387 --> 00:29:57.456
Thanks.

405
00:30:00.896 --> 00:30:01.896
By the way,

406
00:30:03.297 --> 00:30:06.496
we got Lee Kwang Ho's DNA,

407
00:30:08.837 --> 00:30:10.137
and mine too.

408
00:30:10.506 --> 00:30:11.537
Jong Sam.

409
00:30:17.006 --> 00:30:18.077
It's true then.

410
00:30:20.976 --> 00:30:22.246
I heard the result too.

411
00:30:24.916 --> 00:30:26.587
Only Su Chil and Inspector Cho know.

412
00:30:27.156 --> 00:30:28.617
They'll keep it a secret.

413
00:30:41.837 --> 00:30:43.607
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

414
00:30:45.166 --> 00:30:46.436
You are the crazy one.

415
00:30:47.577 --> 00:30:49.637
Do you think I was being loyal to you?

416
00:30:50.047 --> 00:30:52.746
No, it was because of my son.

417
00:30:53.617 --> 00:30:55.077
My son whom I abandoned.

418
00:30:55.716 --> 00:30:58.517
The boy you adopted was my son. I made my son...

419
00:30:58.517 --> 00:31:01.486
the son of a congressman, the president.

420
00:31:03.156 --> 00:31:04.426
I trusted you.

421
00:31:05.527 --> 00:31:08.327
I thought you'd make him a president too.

422
00:31:10.527 --> 00:31:12.926
But he wasn't my son.

423
00:31:14.297 --> 00:31:16.196
For my nonexistent son,

424
00:31:16.807 --> 00:31:18.706
I put blood on my hands...

425
00:31:19.067 --> 00:31:22.577
to cover up your dirty past.

426
00:31:23.506 --> 00:31:25.277
But you killed my son.

427
00:31:27.817 --> 00:31:29.077
You kept it a secret...

428
00:31:30.047 --> 00:31:32.517
for 25 years.

429
00:31:32.716 --> 00:31:34.256
How dare you...

430
00:31:34.756 --> 00:31:36.387
Gook Su Ran, are you mad?

431
00:31:36.587 --> 00:31:40.196
For 25 years! You switched the kids.

432
00:31:41.656 --> 00:31:43.396
Was it fun for you?

433
00:31:44.067 --> 00:31:46.027
Did you think the world was your playground?

434
00:31:46.027 --> 00:31:47.767
What are you doing? Take her out!

435
00:31:48.137 --> 00:31:49.137
Let's go.

436
00:31:50.906 --> 00:31:51.936
No.

437
00:31:52.767 --> 00:31:55.176
If I get arrested, you could get killed too.

438
00:31:57.047 --> 00:31:58.377
So let's die together.

439
00:32:01.047 --> 00:32:03.117
Is your life worth as much as mine?

440
00:32:04.246 --> 00:32:05.817
If you want to kill me,

441
00:32:06.117 --> 00:32:09.256
you'd have to offer at least three more lives.

442
00:32:09.517 --> 00:32:11.756
We have General Manager Kwak and Assistant Manager Ki.

443
00:32:12.627 --> 00:32:13.827
Young Min as well.

444
00:32:14.527 --> 00:32:16.926
If you drag Manager Lee into this,

445
00:32:17.896 --> 00:32:20.236
you won't be the only one dying.

446
00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:36.460
(Episode 36 will air shortly.)
