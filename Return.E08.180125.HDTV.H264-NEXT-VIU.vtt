00:00:05.583 --> 00:00:06.583
(Episode 8)

2
00:00:06.586 --> 00:00:08.156
Why can't I run a DNA test...

3
00:00:08.156 --> 00:00:09.916
when the corpse hasn't been identified properly?

4
00:00:09.916 --> 00:00:13.285
Given the state it's in, running a DNA test might not be possible.

5
00:00:13.285 --> 00:00:15.025
I mean, the body wasn't burnt to ashes.

6
00:00:15.025 --> 00:00:17.025
We must try as far as our resources allow.

7
00:00:17.025 --> 00:00:19.166
The family already confirmed the body belongs to the deceased.

8
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:21.295
You don't have the right to say otherwise.

9
00:00:21.295 --> 00:00:23.466
That body doesn't belong to Seo Joon Hee!

10
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:26.806
- Do you have proof? - That's why we need the DNA test!

11
00:00:26.806 --> 00:00:28.176
But the family doesn't want that!

12
00:00:28.236 --> 00:00:29.705
So stop causing trouble.

13
00:00:29.975 --> 00:00:32.576
What a punk. Goodness.

14
00:00:43.216 --> 00:00:45.085
There are no surveillance cameras on the road.

15
00:00:45.085 --> 00:00:47.085
Except us, not a single vehicle...

16
00:00:47.896 --> 00:00:50.326
passed by here for half an hour.

17
00:00:50.695 --> 00:00:52.865
He was abducted in front of the precinct,

18
00:00:53.295 --> 00:00:56.466
but he ended up in this desolate area and got into an accident.

19
00:00:57.405 --> 00:00:58.665
Isn't that strange?

20
00:01:00.235 --> 00:01:01.935
I should go down there.

21
00:01:02.136 --> 00:01:03.206
Down there?

22
00:01:48.385 --> 00:01:50.656
I just need to talk to him. I'm only going to talk...

23
00:01:54.256 --> 00:01:58.165
Why... I'm here to talk to him. I'll be gone after that. Seriously.

24
00:01:58.225 --> 00:02:00.225
- You jerks. - What's wrong with him?

25
00:02:01.665 --> 00:02:02.965
My goodness.

26
00:02:12.746 --> 00:02:14.475
Unbelievable.

27
00:02:14.515 --> 00:02:15.975
If you enter the hall one more time,

28
00:02:16.246 --> 00:02:18.015
we won't be nice anymore.

29
00:02:23.385 --> 00:02:24.686
They're tough.

30
00:02:30.626 --> 00:02:33.466
Hey, Dong Bae. Locate Kim Hak Bum.

31
00:02:33.695 --> 00:02:37.366
Come on. Open up the door quickly. I said, "quickly"!

32
00:02:38.506 --> 00:02:40.165
Do your job right.

33
00:02:40.205 --> 00:02:41.306
My gosh.

34
00:02:48.575 --> 00:02:52.885
Gosh, I brought juice when I heard you were in the hospital.

35
00:02:54.355 --> 00:02:55.855
Where were you? You're a patient.

36
00:02:55.885 --> 00:02:56.915
Look.

37
00:02:58.985 --> 00:02:59.985
I...

38
00:03:00.695 --> 00:03:02.596
don't know anything.

39
00:03:02.596 --> 00:03:03.756
My goodness.

40
00:03:05.026 --> 00:03:06.866
I didn't ask you any questions.

41
00:03:06.866 --> 00:03:08.895
I merely said I came here for a visit.

42
00:03:10.605 --> 00:03:11.635
I...

43
00:03:12.866 --> 00:03:15.276
don't know. I know nothing.

44
00:03:16.135 --> 00:03:17.376
Darn it.

45
00:03:19.006 --> 00:03:20.376
I have nothing to say to you.

46
00:03:22.045 --> 00:03:23.376
Hey, you're bleeding.

47
00:03:23.376 --> 00:03:26.545
You may die from blood poisoning if you pull this out wrong.

48
00:03:27.116 --> 00:03:29.385
Even if you're in a rush, you should leave it to an expert.

49
00:03:29.385 --> 00:03:30.385
Let go.

50
00:03:31.455 --> 00:03:33.225
I don't know what the rush was though.

51
00:03:33.225 --> 00:03:34.395
What's going on?

52
00:03:34.955 --> 00:03:36.026
Darn it.

53
00:03:43.036 --> 00:03:45.506
I came to visit Kim Hak Bum,

54
00:03:45.506 --> 00:03:47.066
who was throwing a fit.

55
00:03:47.135 --> 00:03:49.876
If you came to visit him, why is my friend...

56
00:03:49.876 --> 00:03:51.306
so pale?

57
00:03:51.975 --> 00:03:53.175
I don't know.

58
00:03:53.776 --> 00:03:56.616
There are two reasons you get pale when you see a detective.

59
00:03:56.776 --> 00:03:59.015
Either you lied, or committed a crime.

60
00:04:01.756 --> 00:04:03.985
Don't you remember me by any chance?

61
00:04:07.325 --> 00:04:09.795
Our paths crossed briefly in the past.

62
00:04:14.496 --> 00:04:17.405
I wonder if you remember Kim Soo Hyun.

63
00:04:19.765 --> 00:04:22.135
Your friend didn't remember at all.

64
00:04:26.445 --> 00:04:30.145
(9 Years Ago)

65
00:04:30.476 --> 00:04:31.645
Does it hurt?

66
00:04:34.186 --> 00:04:35.416
Don't cry.

67
00:04:36.155 --> 00:04:38.455
Do only one at a time. Be in pain or cry.

68
00:04:43.965 --> 00:04:45.226
Why you...

69
00:04:45.395 --> 00:04:47.666
I told you to stop crying. Seriously.

70
00:04:49.296 --> 00:04:52.236
Tae Suk. Have you come?

71
00:04:55.835 --> 00:04:57.976
- Did Joon Hee take drugs? - Yes.

72
00:04:58.676 --> 00:05:00.775
In Ho. Take Joon Hee out of here,

73
00:05:01.376 --> 00:05:03.116
- and get him out of the country. - Okay.

74
00:05:03.986 --> 00:05:05.046
What about me?

75
00:05:06.445 --> 00:05:07.556
Come on.

76
00:05:11.885 --> 00:05:12.955
Did Joon Hee do that to her?

77
00:05:14.395 --> 00:05:17.666
Freak. You have to stop punching people.

78
00:05:18.226 --> 00:05:21.635
Stop nagging, and help me out, Tae Suk!

79
00:05:21.635 --> 00:05:22.895
Seriously.

80
00:05:23.666 --> 00:05:24.765
Hak Bum.

81
00:05:26.535 --> 00:05:27.575
Take it off.

82
00:05:28.275 --> 00:05:29.835
- What? - Take it off.

83
00:05:31.246 --> 00:05:32.376
Take off my clothes?

84
00:05:36.546 --> 00:05:37.616
Here.

85
00:05:38.585 --> 00:05:39.585
Hey!

86
00:05:40.916 --> 00:05:43.215
- Hey! - Me too! Me too!

87
00:05:46.056 --> 00:05:48.726
Hey. Have you lost your mind?

88
00:05:48.726 --> 00:05:50.256
- Shut it, and take a few more. - What?

89
00:05:50.256 --> 00:05:52.895
Wait! You'll hit me more?

90
00:05:53.195 --> 00:05:55.066
Are you trying to kill me?

91
00:05:55.066 --> 00:05:56.535
I'm doing this to save you!

92
00:05:58.465 --> 00:06:01.135
After we leave, call the cops. And this...

93
00:06:02.236 --> 00:06:03.436
is what you say.

94
00:06:04.246 --> 00:06:07.676
You got out of the rape and assault of 18-year-old...

95
00:06:07.676 --> 00:06:09.316
Kim Soo Hyun.

96
00:06:10.585 --> 00:06:12.046
You refuse to give a statement, right?

97
00:06:13.345 --> 00:06:15.256
- Yes. - "Yes."

98
00:06:16.316 --> 00:06:17.486
Your lawyer's coming, right?

99
00:06:18.056 --> 00:06:19.986
- Yes. - "Yes."

100
00:06:23.895 --> 00:06:25.765
What are you wearing?

101
00:06:26.226 --> 00:06:27.566
Why do you dress like that?

102
00:06:27.835 --> 00:06:30.366
That ridiculous cop, who investigated a rape...

103
00:06:30.366 --> 00:06:32.606
with the victim and rapist sitting side by side,

104
00:06:33.236 --> 00:06:34.535
was a total joke.

105
00:06:34.876 --> 00:06:35.936
Sir.

106
00:06:36.506 --> 00:06:39.176
Well, you should segregate the assailant and the victim first.

107
00:06:44.986 --> 00:06:46.845
Sure. I guess.

108
00:06:53.655 --> 00:06:54.695
Excuse me.

109
00:06:56.695 --> 00:06:58.496
- Hey. - Hi.

110
00:06:59.265 --> 00:07:00.395
Are you okay?

111
00:07:04.405 --> 00:07:07.676
I'm not sure what you mean.

112
00:07:07.676 --> 00:07:10.506
Nine years ago, a high school girl...

113
00:07:10.945 --> 00:07:14.075
was attacked by two men who had studied abroad.

114
00:07:14.746 --> 00:07:16.215
One left the country immediately thereafter,

115
00:07:16.215 --> 00:07:19.885
and the other claimed it happened while they were on a date.

116
00:07:20.655 --> 00:07:21.686
Is that correct?

117
00:07:22.885 --> 00:07:26.325
That case... That wasn't even a case.

118
00:07:26.325 --> 00:07:27.895
It was just an incident.

119
00:07:28.695 --> 00:07:31.965
That girl lied to extort money.

120
00:07:32.395 --> 00:07:34.635
I believe her family testified to that.

121
00:07:34.635 --> 00:07:36.366
The girl lied about her age,

122
00:07:37.306 --> 00:07:39.936
and the boys were abroad for way too long,

123
00:07:39.936 --> 00:07:41.476
so they didn't know the cultural difference.

124
00:07:41.775 --> 00:07:43.075
What else was there?

125
00:07:45.845 --> 00:07:48.645
She consented to sadomasochism,

126
00:07:49.145 --> 00:07:51.845
but he got too excited and failed to control himself.

127
00:07:52.445 --> 00:07:55.816
To prove that, he called an ambulance and stuff.

128
00:07:56.015 --> 00:07:59.085
You left very calculated and smart evidence.

129
00:07:59.626 --> 00:08:02.756
The case was closed once a witness gave...

130
00:08:03.025 --> 00:08:06.395
a crucial testimony on behalf of the accused.

131
00:08:06.395 --> 00:08:09.395
That witness was a woman who owned a small wine bar.

132
00:08:09.395 --> 00:08:10.936
That's what happened.

133
00:08:11.035 --> 00:08:14.436
Come to think of it, two of the people from that case...

134
00:08:14.436 --> 00:08:17.845
are tied to this case too. That frightens me a little.

135
00:08:19.106 --> 00:08:21.015
In case it ends as being nothing but "an incident"...

136
00:08:21.616 --> 00:08:23.015
when two people died.

137
00:08:23.345 --> 00:08:24.445
Of course, not.

138
00:08:24.986 --> 00:08:26.686
If you commit a crime, you must be punished.

139
00:08:27.085 --> 00:08:30.285
If you are innocent, you should not be punished. That's the law.

140
00:08:32.455 --> 00:08:33.486
That's right.

141
00:08:33.996 --> 00:08:36.525
If everyone in the world would abide by that,

142
00:08:36.525 --> 00:08:38.466
life would be so much easier.

143
00:08:38.726 --> 00:08:40.096
Please leave now.

144
00:08:40.096 --> 00:08:42.535
As you can see, my friend isn't feeling very well.

145
00:08:42.535 --> 00:08:44.565
Yes, sure. I'll do that.

146
00:08:49.775 --> 00:08:50.905
But you know...

147
00:08:54.315 --> 00:08:56.275
one thing has changed since then.

148
00:08:58.885 --> 00:09:01.315
The punk rookie detective...

149
00:09:01.586 --> 00:09:03.055
is now a veteran.

150
00:09:04.126 --> 00:09:07.086
A very, very persistent one.

151
00:09:08.726 --> 00:09:11.425
Just what is it you want to say?

152
00:09:12.065 --> 00:09:14.665
I don't know how to respond to your gibberish.

153
00:09:14.665 --> 00:09:16.466
I'm quite flustered.

154
00:09:17.135 --> 00:09:19.706
It's okay. No need to be flustered.

155
00:09:20.305 --> 00:09:23.206
I was explaining how we met, but I ended up gabbing.

156
00:09:23.775 --> 00:09:28.645
Just for your information, we will definitely run Seo Joon Hee's DNA.

157
00:09:31.045 --> 00:09:33.116
I wanted to give you a heads up for old times' sake.

158
00:09:47.565 --> 00:09:48.596
Hey.

159
00:09:50.096 --> 00:09:51.836
What is that all about?

160
00:09:52.665 --> 00:09:55.405
- A DNA test? - I don't know.

161
00:09:57.106 --> 00:09:58.106
Actually,

162
00:09:59.446 --> 00:10:01.315
Joon Hee's corpse did look weird.

163
00:10:01.315 --> 00:10:04.246
Weird? What was weird?

164
00:10:04.246 --> 00:10:05.946
It was too short and skinny.

165
00:10:06.415 --> 00:10:08.716
The watch and clothes were definitely his.

166
00:10:09.785 --> 00:10:12.555
I thought perhaps he shrank in the fire, but...

167
00:10:12.685 --> 00:10:15.155
We just have to get a DNA test!

168
00:10:18.366 --> 00:10:19.525
What if it is him?

169
00:10:20.096 --> 00:10:21.736
You crushed his head with a rock.

170
00:10:22.165 --> 00:10:23.336
What if they find that?

171
00:10:25.535 --> 00:10:26.805
Even if it isn't him,

172
00:10:28.405 --> 00:10:30.076
it'll still be complicated.

173
00:10:30.076 --> 00:10:31.876
Daemyung will demand an investigation.

174
00:10:32.645 --> 00:10:33.946
Things will get messier.

175
00:10:35.175 --> 00:10:36.315
So?

176
00:10:37.645 --> 00:10:39.385
What will you do now?

177
00:10:41.086 --> 00:10:43.956
You can reach that guy who cleans up after you, right?

178
00:10:44.155 --> 00:10:46.025
- Why? - Call him.

179
00:10:46.555 --> 00:10:48.925
No. Give me his information.

180
00:10:55.196 --> 00:10:56.736
I poked at the beehive,

181
00:10:56.736 --> 00:10:59.236
so things should get noisy if it isn't empty.

182
00:11:02.236 --> 00:11:04.045
- Hello? - This is Choi Ja Hye.

183
00:11:04.045 --> 00:11:05.346
Where are you now?

184
00:11:10.275 --> 00:11:12.885
No, no. You go home first today.

185
00:11:13.685 --> 00:11:16.456
- Your child must be waiting. - Still.

186
00:11:16.456 --> 00:11:18.756
I'm telling you to rest so that you can run farther,

187
00:11:18.756 --> 00:11:21.496
so go home, and rest. Run twice as hard tomorrow.

188
00:11:24.326 --> 00:11:25.525
Okay.

189
00:11:51.155 --> 00:11:52.425
Why do you look like that?

190
00:11:52.425 --> 00:11:54.596
Let's drop the unnecessary gab.

191
00:11:55.555 --> 00:11:58.126
I went to Seo Joon Hee's accident site.

192
00:11:58.966 --> 00:12:00.395
The body they found.

193
00:12:01.236 --> 00:12:02.665
Is it really Seo Joon Hee?

194
00:12:05.405 --> 00:12:07.035
What do you mean by that?

195
00:12:07.935 --> 00:12:10.035
There are no skid marks on the road.

196
00:12:10.706 --> 00:12:13.376
It poured on the day he disappeared,

197
00:12:13.376 --> 00:12:14.645
so we can overlook that,

198
00:12:14.775 --> 00:12:16.846
but that doesn't explain the car being burnt.

199
00:12:17.185 --> 00:12:20.015
There was soot on the grass around the car...

200
00:12:20.015 --> 00:12:21.616
and on the remains of the car.

201
00:12:22.155 --> 00:12:24.356
It poured, but it wasn't washed off either.

202
00:12:25.025 --> 00:12:26.055
Right?

203
00:12:27.555 --> 00:12:30.626
It's not like it would've waited for the rain to stop before exploding.

204
00:12:36.836 --> 00:12:40.405
Did you confirm the body was his?

205
00:12:40.635 --> 00:12:44.506
The family insists the corpse is Seo Joon Hee,

206
00:12:45.145 --> 00:12:47.476
but I had my doubts as well.

207
00:12:47.846 --> 00:12:49.045
There are many reasons for that.

208
00:12:50.746 --> 00:12:52.116
We must run a DNA test...

209
00:12:52.116 --> 00:12:54.685
before they cremate his body.

210
00:13:06.895 --> 00:13:07.935
What is this?

211
00:13:07.935 --> 00:13:10.035
It was at the scene of the accident.

212
00:13:12.165 --> 00:13:13.236
It's clean, right?

213
00:13:14.706 --> 00:13:18.006
It was within the remains of the car.

214
00:13:18.305 --> 00:13:19.675
Isn't it strange?

215
00:13:21.045 --> 00:13:22.246
There was a third party?

216
00:13:22.315 --> 00:13:24.746
I'm merely pointing out that we must think of every possibility.

217
00:13:30.586 --> 00:13:32.586
So is washing up on your to-do list?

218
00:13:32.586 --> 00:13:34.395
I will heed your advice on that.

219
00:13:36.696 --> 00:13:39.665
Do I need to drop you off?

220
00:13:39.665 --> 00:13:40.736
Absolutely not.

221
00:13:55.760 --> 00:14:00.760
<font color="#fcc89b">[VIU Ver] E08 Return "We Must Run a DNA Test"</font>
<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

222
00:14:16.736 --> 00:14:18.565
That person is driving that car like a mad man.

223
00:14:22.376 --> 00:14:24.775
What's happening? Is that jerk heading my way?

224
00:14:30.045 --> 00:14:32.185
Nobody is here. Why is the red light still on?

225
00:14:43.866 --> 00:14:45.496
- Who are these jerks? - Hey!

226
00:15:01.746 --> 00:15:03.015
My gosh.

227
00:15:10.756 --> 00:15:12.185
Let's wrap up, and go now.

228
00:15:12.385 --> 00:15:13.425
Yes, sir.

229
00:16:09.246 --> 00:16:12.385
Darn it. Those crazy jerks.

230
00:16:13.746 --> 00:16:15.555
They should've finished the job at once.

231
00:16:22.356 --> 00:16:23.356
What?

232
00:16:24.665 --> 00:16:28.035
Shoot. I can't grab it with my hand.

233
00:16:46.545 --> 00:16:47.685
Dong Bae?

234
00:16:48.555 --> 00:16:49.586
Where are you?

235
00:16:50.586 --> 00:16:51.925
What about you?

236
00:16:52.155 --> 00:16:53.155
Me?

237
00:16:55.356 --> 00:16:58.366
I'm on my way back from the hospital where my uncle is being treated.

238
00:16:58.366 --> 00:17:01.236
I see. Then you can't come pick me up.

239
00:17:01.366 --> 00:17:02.366
Where are you?

240
00:17:02.395 --> 00:17:04.936
- I got into an accident. - How bad is it?

241
00:17:05.035 --> 00:17:07.775
I think my car rolled about three times.

242
00:17:09.636 --> 00:17:12.375
But I can't move my arm. It hurts so much.

243
00:17:12.875 --> 00:17:15.075
Okay, okay.

244
00:17:15.615 --> 00:17:17.646
You can pop back the dislocated shoulder by yourself, right?

245
00:17:18.845 --> 00:17:20.956
The heroes in the movies seem to do it really well.

246
00:17:20.956 --> 00:17:23.416
I'm serious right now, you jerk.

247
00:17:25.055 --> 00:17:26.656
Hey, but...

248
00:17:27.256 --> 00:17:28.926
if you can't come,

249
00:17:30.426 --> 00:17:33.025
you should really call an ambulance for me.

250
00:17:33.125 --> 00:17:34.966
Stop joking, Young.

251
00:17:47.946 --> 00:17:49.176
What was that sound?

252
00:17:50.315 --> 00:17:51.315
Young.

253
00:17:52.486 --> 00:17:53.515
Young!

254
00:17:54.015 --> 00:17:55.015
Hello?

255
00:17:56.285 --> 00:17:58.085
Dokgo Young.

256
00:18:11.006 --> 00:18:13.236
They aren't even done with the tests yet.

257
00:18:14.835 --> 00:18:15.835
Dong Bae.

258
00:18:16.335 --> 00:18:17.875
How can I, the almighty Dokgo Young,

259
00:18:17.875 --> 00:18:20.775
lie on this bed because of just a dislocated shoulder?

260
00:18:21.845 --> 00:18:24.386
You pulled a ligament in your wrist and have a cast on.

261
00:18:24.386 --> 00:18:26.615
Hey, this is overtreatment.

262
00:18:26.615 --> 00:18:28.656
They only did the minimal treatment.

263
00:18:28.656 --> 00:18:31.226
You woke up after nine hours. You can't go anywhere.

264
00:18:34.355 --> 00:18:35.355
Dong Bae.

265
00:18:36.696 --> 00:18:37.726
You should know this about me.

266
00:18:39.166 --> 00:18:40.295
Although I may not return the favor,

267
00:18:41.466 --> 00:18:43.396
but I always take my revenge.

268
00:18:46.136 --> 00:18:48.335
Stop it. Your doctor is going to kill me.

269
00:18:48.335 --> 00:18:50.335
Why do you keep following me?

270
00:18:50.875 --> 00:18:55.015
Then do I send you off when you're trying to leave in this state?

271
00:18:55.416 --> 00:18:56.416
My gosh.

272
00:18:57.386 --> 00:18:58.416
What is it?

273
00:18:59.216 --> 00:19:00.345
Look here now.

274
00:19:04.555 --> 00:19:06.285
From now on, you are Dokgo Young.

275
00:19:07.696 --> 00:19:08.756
Go to sleep!

276
00:19:17.466 --> 00:19:19.335
Gosh, he must've finally lost his marbles now.

277
00:19:48.835 --> 00:19:49.835
What's going on?

278
00:19:50.605 --> 00:19:51.605
Don't get off the car.

279
00:20:00.775 --> 00:20:03.315
Mr. Seo Chan Jong of Daemyung Hospital!

280
00:20:11.625 --> 00:20:12.656
Mr. Seo, what's going on?

281
00:20:12.926 --> 00:20:13.996
I'm not sure.

282
00:20:13.996 --> 00:20:16.795
I'm the detective on Seo Joon Hee's car accident case.

283
00:20:17.865 --> 00:20:19.966
You don't need to talk to him. I'll take care of this.

284
00:20:21.835 --> 00:20:23.565
My gosh. Unbelievable.

285
00:20:24.136 --> 00:20:25.906
How could he interrupt the funeral cortege?

286
00:20:26.136 --> 00:20:27.136
Mr. Seo!

287
00:20:28.575 --> 00:20:30.845
Do you really not want to find your son?

288
00:20:41.615 --> 00:20:43.555
Have you gone mad? Is that it?

289
00:20:46.355 --> 00:20:48.656
I was pretty much sane before this happened.

290
00:20:49.996 --> 00:20:52.265
But somebody ordered some guys to beat me up.

291
00:20:53.696 --> 00:20:55.696
I wasn't sure before that,

292
00:20:57.535 --> 00:20:58.835
but now, I get the feeling I'm right.

293
00:21:00.676 --> 00:21:02.636
So I plan to go completely crazy.

294
00:21:06.676 --> 00:21:07.676
You know what?

295
00:21:08.375 --> 00:21:10.315
I can deal with getting beat up,

296
00:21:10.315 --> 00:21:12.085
but I can't let it slide when someone ruins my car,

297
00:21:12.085 --> 00:21:13.545
which my late father bought for me...

298
00:21:13.545 --> 00:21:16.285
to congratulate me for becoming a cop with his savings.

299
00:21:17.686 --> 00:21:18.686
That breaks my heart.

300
00:21:18.686 --> 00:21:21.756
Why are you whining about your life at my friend's funeral cortege?

301
00:21:23.625 --> 00:21:24.625
Mr. Seo.

302
00:21:25.065 --> 00:21:28.265
Are you going to hold a funeral for someone else's son? Are you?

303
00:21:30.295 --> 00:21:31.636
That's enough, Tae Suk.

304
00:21:34.375 --> 00:21:36.375
If we verify that he's my son...

305
00:21:36.636 --> 00:21:38.575
after the DNA test,

306
00:21:39.605 --> 00:21:41.476
you'd better get ready to face the consequence.

307
00:21:45.186 --> 00:21:47.515
If it's not Seo Joon Hee, you must face the consequence.

308
00:21:47.956 --> 00:21:48.956
Will you be okay with that?

309
00:21:55.855 --> 00:21:58.525
Did something happen to my friends?

310
00:21:58.966 --> 00:22:01.436
Yes, specifically to Mr. Seo Joon Hee.

311
00:22:03.295 --> 00:22:07.406
Mr. Seo Joon Hee came near the precinct...

312
00:22:07.736 --> 00:22:09.875
to clear your name, Mr. Kang.

313
00:22:11.246 --> 00:22:12.906
Joon Hee did that?

314
00:22:14.246 --> 00:22:16.246
Where... Where is Joon Hee now?

315
00:22:16.246 --> 00:22:19.085
I'd like to see him myself. Please let me see him now.

316
00:22:19.085 --> 00:22:22.156
It's impossible for you to meet Mr. Seo.

317
00:22:22.156 --> 00:22:24.886
Why not? If he can prove my innocence,

318
00:22:25.055 --> 00:22:27.426
I will get out right away.

319
00:22:27.496 --> 00:22:29.325
Mr. Seo Joon Hee...

320
00:22:31.065 --> 00:22:34.365
is in Kyungchoon Hospital's morgue.

321
00:22:37.236 --> 00:22:38.636
What... What...

322
00:22:40.775 --> 00:22:42.775
What does that mean?

323
00:22:42.805 --> 00:22:47.315
Mr. Seo was on his way to the precinct to clear your name,

324
00:22:47.775 --> 00:22:49.946
but he was found dead.

325
00:22:53.545 --> 00:22:54.656
Joon Hee...

326
00:22:57.325 --> 00:22:58.555
Joon Hee...

327
00:22:59.656 --> 00:23:01.625
is dead?

328
00:23:02.256 --> 00:23:06.565
I contemplated whether I should deliver this news or not.

329
00:23:08.365 --> 00:23:09.396
But...

330
00:23:11.035 --> 00:23:13.875
I thought that you should know.

331
00:23:17.605 --> 00:23:21.275
Joon... Joon Hee...

332
00:23:28.115 --> 00:23:29.315
No...

333
00:23:32.656 --> 00:23:35.456
Joon Hee...

334
00:23:59.815 --> 00:24:00.886
Excuse me.

335
00:24:02.386 --> 00:24:03.926
Just a minute. What...

336
00:24:05.956 --> 00:24:06.956
Excuse me.

337
00:24:08.926 --> 00:24:10.025
Excuse me!

338
00:24:10.525 --> 00:24:12.166
Just a minute!

339
00:24:29.176 --> 00:24:30.986
Dong Bae! Where are you?

340
00:24:31.146 --> 00:24:35.686
Sorry. I got a call that my uncle was in critical condition.

341
00:24:35.686 --> 00:24:37.085
I see.

342
00:24:37.226 --> 00:24:39.426
Then call me later.

343
00:24:39.825 --> 00:24:41.396
Why? Do you have any news?

344
00:24:43.156 --> 00:24:44.966
I have the DNA test result.

345
00:24:45.166 --> 00:24:46.226
You do?

346
00:24:46.565 --> 00:24:49.396
The body in the car wreck isn't Seo Joon Hee's.

347
00:24:50.236 --> 00:24:52.835
I'm on my way to Daemyung Hospital to see his father.

348
00:24:54.335 --> 00:24:57.206
- Have a nice visit with your uncle. - Thanks.

349
00:25:23.966 --> 00:25:25.966
Why couldn't do tell me over the phone?

350
00:25:26.406 --> 00:25:27.476
Well, look at this.

351
00:25:55.466 --> 00:25:58.166
- Who is this? - Joon Hee.

352
00:26:00.136 --> 00:26:01.575
He's alive.

353
00:26:41.615 --> 00:26:43.545
(Return)

354
00:26:44.515 --> 00:26:46.615
Do you think Yum Mi Jung's killer...

355
00:26:46.615 --> 00:26:48.355
hid Seo Joon Hee?

356
00:26:48.355 --> 00:26:49.585
What are you trying to say?

357
00:26:49.585 --> 00:26:52.785
I wonder who sent this to you and why.

358
00:26:52.785 --> 00:26:55.125
The fact that a witness, who knows the secret is alive,

359
00:26:55.125 --> 00:26:56.926
must intimidate the real killer.

360
00:26:57.125 --> 00:26:59.966
There's a rumor that they killed each other.

361
00:26:59.966 --> 00:27:01.966
- Was it you? - It wasn't me.

362
00:27:01.966 --> 00:27:03.136
You took care of it, right?

363
00:27:03.136 --> 00:27:06.065
This... This stinks something awful.

364
00:27:06.136 --> 00:27:07.136
You...

365
00:27:08.035 --> 00:27:09.136
Who are you?
