1
00:00:08.492 --> 00:00:12.290
I told you that the swindler found a new prey, right?

2
00:00:12.295 --> 00:00:15.330
I think that is Lee Shin Mo,

3
00:00:23.173 --> 00:00:24.370
Look,

4
00:00:24.875 --> 00:00:29.280
Your eyes are about to fall out because of jealousy,

5
00:00:30.213 --> 00:00:31.280
Oh, my,

6
00:00:32.482 --> 00:00:34.210
- What's wrong? - What?

7
00:00:34.217 --> 00:00:36.150
I'm,,,

8
00:00:36.486 --> 00:00:37.890
just really happy,

9
00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:40.660
Do you want me to sing,,,

10
00:00:41.391 --> 00:00:45.890
you an amazing song as a gift for you today?

11
00:00:46.096 --> 00:00:48.790
I have a request then,

12
00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:51.500
I want to make beautiful memories in Jeju Island,

13
00:00:51.501 --> 00:00:52.860
so sing me a song about the ocean,

14
00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:53.940
Okay,

15
00:00:54.438 --> 00:00:57.670
I'll sing a song while playing,,,

16
00:00:57.808 --> 00:01:00.240
the bass just for you,

17
00:01:01.478 --> 00:01:02.740
- Oh, my, - Okay,

18
00:01:04.081 --> 00:01:05.280
Excuse me,

19
00:01:07.284 --> 00:01:09.550
- What is this? - They said you'll know if you see,

20
00:01:12.589 --> 00:01:14.290
I have something to tell you,

21
00:01:14.691 --> 00:01:16.660
so let's meet outside,

22
00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.430
What is it?

23
00:01:21.231 --> 00:01:23.660
What? It's nothing,

24
00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:26.400
Wait for me, I'll be back soon,

25
00:01:26.636 --> 00:01:27.770
Okay,

26
00:01:28.205 --> 00:01:29.870
Come back soon,

27
00:01:47.824 --> 00:01:50.890
Did you send me that message?

28
00:01:53.563 --> 00:01:54.800
Yes,

29
00:01:55.632 --> 00:01:56.930
Your name is,,,

30
00:01:57.667 --> 00:02:00.200
Choi Theresa, isn't it?

31
00:02:01.338 --> 00:02:04.510
Yes, but who are you?

32
00:02:07.777 --> 00:02:09.480
Are you my fan?

33
00:02:11.314 --> 00:02:14.280
Male fans ask to see me like this sometimes,

34
00:02:14.284 --> 00:02:15.950
This is the first time a female fan did this,

35
00:02:15.952 --> 00:02:19.150
I'm Lee Shin Mo's wife,

36
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.030
It's been a long time,

37
00:02:29.766 --> 00:02:31.360
Can I pour you a drink?

38
00:02:31.368 --> 00:02:32.900
No,

39
00:02:33.937 --> 00:02:36.470
It's okay, I have to drive later,

40
00:02:37.974 --> 00:02:41.880
It seems like you're here with my wife,

41
00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:45.380
Did she leave?

42
00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:47.250
She went outside for a moment,

43
00:02:47.851 --> 00:02:51.650
I think I saw you with a woman,

44
00:02:52.055 --> 00:02:54.620
Can I ask you what kind of relationship you are with her?

45
00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:58.730
The punk has good taste in women,

46
00:02:58.895 --> 00:03:00.790
He came here because he's jealous,

47
00:03:00.797 --> 00:03:03.030
You saw us,

48
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.800
Don't get us wrong,

49
00:03:05.802 --> 00:03:08.370
She's like a sister to me,

50
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.610
However to her, I'm someone,,,

51
00:03:14.411 --> 00:03:17.750
she used to admire during her college years,

52
00:03:18.548 --> 00:03:20.180
Her methods are always the same,

53
00:03:21.051 --> 00:03:22.080
What did you say?

54
00:03:22.085 --> 00:03:23.320
Never mind,

55
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.550
Is it her birthday today?

56
00:03:26.723 --> 00:03:28.790
How did you know that?

57
00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:32.160
Do you know Theresa?

58
00:03:32.162 --> 00:03:33.500
No,

59
00:03:36.967 --> 00:03:39.930
Let me give you advice on one thing,

60
00:03:41.438 --> 00:03:44.240
Your method is wrong,

61
00:03:44.941 --> 00:03:46.710
Do you think that a woman will fall for you,,,

62
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.910
if you buy her a car and take her to places like this?

63
00:03:49.913 --> 00:03:51.610
You're so childish,

64
00:03:53.083 --> 00:03:54.180
Look at me,

65
00:03:55.051 --> 00:03:56.790
Even if you don't give her a lot of things,

66
00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.750
if you're kind,

67
00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.860
young and beautiful women will line up for you,

68
00:04:05.762 --> 00:04:07.560
- Is that so? - And,,,

69
00:04:07.731 --> 00:04:10.600
you seem younger than me,

70
00:04:10.967 --> 00:04:13.030
Why would you meet an older woman?

71
00:04:14.437 --> 00:04:17.970
She's even someone else's wife,

72
00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.550
Stop wasting money and time,

73
00:04:24.914 --> 00:04:27.420
Try having a proper relationship,

74
00:04:27.917 --> 00:04:29.120
Like me,

75
00:04:30.153 --> 00:04:31.250
Do you understand?

76
00:04:31.721 --> 00:04:34.220
I don't judge women by age,

77
00:04:34.924 --> 00:04:37.930
Let me give you a piece of advice too,

78
00:04:38.595 --> 00:04:42.300
Not every woman is as innocent as Young Hye,

79
00:04:43.433 --> 00:04:45.800
So be careful,

80
00:04:46.736 --> 00:04:47.900
That's it,

81
00:04:54.177 --> 00:04:55.240
That punk,

82
00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:57.850
Just say that you're jealous,

83
00:04:58.415 --> 00:05:01.550
Stop beating around the bush, Goodness,

84
00:05:02.786 --> 00:05:06.650
What's taking her so long?

85
00:05:08.291 --> 00:05:11.430
Are you Shin Mo's wife?

86
00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.800
Why did you ask for me?

87
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.430
I'm going to make this short,

88
00:05:19.602 --> 00:05:23.300
Stop seeing my husband,

89
00:05:24.107 --> 00:05:26.470
I asked to see you to tell you this,

90
00:05:27.477 --> 00:05:29.980
Do you think you have the right to say that?

91
00:05:30.347 --> 00:05:34.480
I know your story because Shin Mo told me,

92
00:05:34.784 --> 00:05:36.550
I heard that you're separated,,,

93
00:05:36.553 --> 00:05:38.750
because you wanted a marriage graduation first,

94
00:05:39.656 --> 00:05:42.290
That's it if you abandon your husband because you don't like him,

95
00:05:42.292 --> 00:05:46.060
Why are you interrupting him when he's trying to become happy?

96
00:05:46.596 --> 00:05:49.090
You don't want him, but you don't want anyone else to have him?

97
00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:50.370
Is that what it is?

98
00:05:51.868 --> 00:05:55.870
I'll keep this short for your pride,

99
00:05:56.339 --> 00:05:58.110
Once again,

100
00:05:58.341 --> 00:06:01.540
don't meet my husband,

101
00:06:02.679 --> 00:06:04.280
It's a marriage graduation, not a divorce,

102
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.550
Don't use him as your investment technique,

103
00:06:06.983 --> 00:06:09.620
What did you say? Investment technique?

104
00:06:12.188 --> 00:06:14.150
What nonsense are you talking about?

105
00:06:14.157 --> 00:06:15.850
I don't have to explain, You already know well,

106
00:06:15.859 --> 00:06:18.160
No, I don't know what you're talking about,

107
00:06:18.428 --> 00:06:20.990
Do you mean that I approached him to extort money,,,

108
00:06:20.997 --> 00:06:24.160
instead of an innocent intention?

109
00:06:24.167 --> 00:06:26.730
You know well who Song Se Joon is, don't you?

110
00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:30.240
I heard everything about you from him,

111
00:06:31.474 --> 00:06:36.110
It seems that my husband bought that watch you're wearing right now,

112
00:06:36.112 --> 00:06:37.250
But end it there,

113
00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.710
That's not a bad business for meeting him,,,

114
00:06:40.717 --> 00:06:42.050
a few times,

115
00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:45.920
I'll assume that we are on the same page and leave now,

116
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:48.360
What if I can't?

117
00:06:51.027 --> 00:06:53.560
I think you have gotten the wrong idea,

118
00:06:53.596 --> 00:06:55.560
I'm not taking advantage of Shin Mo,

119
00:06:55.932 --> 00:06:58.430
Shin Mo was my first love,

120
00:06:58.435 --> 00:07:01.240
We are seeing each other because our hearts have aligned,

121
00:07:01.971 --> 00:07:05.110
This watch? I didn't force him to buy me the watch,

122
00:07:05.809 --> 00:07:08.810
He bought it because he wanted to, How is that taking advantage of him?

123
00:07:09.746 --> 00:07:13.050
Besides, whether I take advantage of him or use him as my banker,

124
00:07:13.349 --> 00:07:15.680
do you honestly think you have the right to tell me off?

125
00:07:16.052 --> 00:07:17.720
Didn't you hear me?

126
00:07:18.655 --> 00:07:20.220
We are still married,

127
00:07:20.723 --> 00:07:22.560
Even if you're only married on paper?

128
00:07:24.661 --> 00:07:25.860
What did you say?

129
00:07:25.929 --> 00:07:27.990
You worked him like a slave for all these years,

130
00:07:27.997 --> 00:07:30.230
You left him after he retired and stopped making money,

131
00:07:30.233 --> 00:07:31.670
How could you be so brazen?

132
00:07:32.936 --> 00:07:35.030
Don't you know men get depressed once they retire?

133
00:07:35.038 --> 00:07:37.310
Instead of staying with him in a time of difficulty,

134
00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:38.840
you betrayed him at the worst time,

135
00:07:38.842 --> 00:07:42.110
You don't have the right to interfere with his love life,

136
00:07:42.178 --> 00:07:43.340
Watch your tongue,

137
00:07:43.847 --> 00:07:46.920
You know nothing about our marriage, How dare you run your mouth?

138
00:07:47.484 --> 00:07:50.420
We are separated for a reason,

139
00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.350
So regardless of excuses you give me,

140
00:07:54.224 --> 00:07:58.230
I won't stand and watch my husband get scammed by a gold digger,

141
00:07:59.229 --> 00:08:00.430
A gold digger?

142
00:08:02.298 --> 00:08:04.300
So you're going to be rude?

143
00:08:05.168 --> 00:08:06.530
But you know what?

144
00:08:06.669 --> 00:08:08.800
You said you heard everything from Mr, Song,

145
00:08:08.805 --> 00:08:12.110
Then you must have come here with him,

146
00:08:12.175 --> 00:08:14.410
I doubt that you have a business meeting at a place like this,

147
00:08:14.777 --> 00:08:18.550
In a nut shell, you're fooling around with a younger guy too,

148
00:08:18.615 --> 00:08:20.780
And yet, you act like you're classy,,,

149
00:08:20.783 --> 00:08:23.180
while calling me a gold digger, Don't you think that's too much?

150
00:08:23.186 --> 00:08:24.990
- Look, - Are you,,,

151
00:08:26.422 --> 00:08:29.160
worried that he will spend your retirement money?

152
00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:32.790
Tell you what,

153
00:08:33.496 --> 00:08:34.860
Men won't even budge,,,

154
00:08:34.864 --> 00:08:38.100
when I try to seduce them as long as they are happy at home,

155
00:08:38.835 --> 00:08:40.870
The fact that Shin Mo is seeing me,,,

156
00:08:41.204 --> 00:08:44.110
proves that that's how much Shin Mo feels empty and sad,

157
00:08:45.174 --> 00:08:46.740
Nothing comes free in life,

158
00:08:47.277 --> 00:08:49.540
If I can comfort him for the despair,,,

159
00:08:49.546 --> 00:08:52.210
you have caused him, buying me a watch is nothing,

160
00:08:52.215 --> 00:08:55.450
Yes, you might not be happy with this,

161
00:08:55.885 --> 00:08:57.680
but if you got your freedom back after moving out,

162
00:08:57.687 --> 00:08:59.690
you must pay for every consequence,

163
00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.120
Theresa,

164
00:09:04.294 --> 00:09:06.730
You're the one who has gotten the wrong idea,

165
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:09.530
Listen to what I'm about tell you carefully,

166
00:09:12.669 --> 00:09:14.070
You're right,

167
00:09:14.871 --> 00:09:18.770
After our separation, Shin Mo must have gone through a hard time,

168
00:09:19.809 --> 00:09:23.240
That's why he became an easy prey when you approached him,

169
00:09:23.913 --> 00:09:27.650
Just like you said, I'm sure he was comforted,

170
00:09:28.885 --> 00:09:31.120
However, do you think your comfort was genuine?

171
00:09:31.955 --> 00:09:36.020
You're not serious about Shin Mo,

172
00:09:37.026 --> 00:09:40.460
How can your comfort be genuine if he bought it with money?

173
00:09:41.197 --> 00:09:45.000
Don't toy with someone's heart with ulterior motives,

174
00:09:46.169 --> 00:09:49.430
Unlike most men, my husband isn't the type,,,

175
00:09:49.439 --> 00:09:52.610
to believe he can buy love with money,

176
00:09:55.278 --> 00:09:57.810
After he met you, he started to smile more,,,

177
00:09:57.814 --> 00:10:00.480
and seemed to be in a good mood,

178
00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:02.250
Do you know why?

179
00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:07.020
Because he believes that you like him for who he is,

180
00:10:08.124 --> 00:10:12.590
That's why you must not toy with his heart,

181
00:10:13.262 --> 00:10:14.360
Don't you agree?

182
00:10:16.265 --> 00:10:20.100
He pretends that he's strong and manly,

183
00:10:20.436 --> 00:10:23.340
but he has a soft heart who easily gets hurt,

184
00:10:24.173 --> 00:10:27.710
When my husband finds out what kind of person you are,

185
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:29.380
he will get hurt and be disappointed,

186
00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:32.610
And I want to stop that,

187
00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:44.530
Just like you said, if I'm not qualified to be his wife,

188
00:10:45.528 --> 00:10:50.160
you can consider me his companion who stayed with him for a long time,

189
00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:54.070
With that qualification, let me ask you of this,

190
00:10:54.771 --> 00:10:57.240
There was a time when you were innocent too, wasn't there?

191
00:10:58.174 --> 00:11:01.480
I want you to at least be respectful of,,,

192
00:11:02.278 --> 00:11:05.380
your love and the man whom you liked at that time,

193
00:11:06.549 --> 00:11:07.750
I ask of you,

194
00:11:08.317 --> 00:11:09.850
With all my heart,

195
00:11:10.887 --> 00:11:12.490
I'm asking you with all my heart,

196
00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:21.600
Okay,

197
00:11:22.932 --> 00:11:26.330
I was going to end it since it wasn't as lucrative,

198
00:11:28.204 --> 00:11:29.740
Don't worry, You should go,

199
00:11:31.574 --> 00:11:33.270
Keep the discussion,,,

200
00:11:33.676 --> 00:11:35.740
we just had between us, please,

201
00:11:36.713 --> 00:11:40.010
He's a man with a strong sense of pride,

202
00:12:17.019 --> 00:12:18.620
Since you heard everything,

203
00:12:20.189 --> 00:12:21.760
I don't need to explain, right?

204
00:12:22.658 --> 00:12:24.230
You know what kind of person I am,

205
00:12:28.931 --> 00:12:30.700
Here's my excuse,

206
00:12:32.034 --> 00:12:33.600
After I got married,

207
00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:36.740
my husband was addicted to gambling,

208
00:12:38.708 --> 00:12:41.780
I followed him around to help him quit gambling,

209
00:12:43.546 --> 00:12:45.250
In the end, I became addicted too,

210
00:12:51.254 --> 00:12:53.690
Hearing how everything she said was right,

211
00:12:55.291 --> 00:12:56.920
you married a good woman,

212
00:13:01.931 --> 00:13:03.360
Just like she said,

213
00:13:04.333 --> 00:13:08.240
I want to at least be respectful of my love and the man I liked,,,

214
00:13:15.545 --> 00:13:17.480
when I was once innocent,

215
00:13:23.252 --> 00:13:24.850
It's not too late,

216
00:13:25.621 --> 00:13:27.420
Try to get yourself together,,,

217
00:13:27.423 --> 00:13:32.030
That's only possible when I have someone as nice as you around me,

218
00:13:33.896 --> 00:13:35.860
I don't have that kind of person,

219
00:13:39.802 --> 00:13:41.770
Before it's too late, go after her,,,

220
00:13:42.505 --> 00:13:43.870
and start over,

221
00:14:20.443 --> 00:14:24.580
It's snowing

222
00:14:27.083 --> 00:14:30.720
In my lonely heart

223
00:14:33.556 --> 00:14:37.390
Your warm smile

224
00:14:39.161 --> 00:14:43.160
I have been dreaming of

225
00:15:02.685 --> 00:15:03.850
My goodness,

226
00:15:05.154 --> 00:15:06.320
Han Gyul,

227
00:15:06.789 --> 00:15:09.950
Why are you lying in my bed instead of yours?

228
00:15:09.959 --> 00:15:11.920
I need to go to sleep now,

229
00:15:11.928 --> 00:15:14.890
Can't I sleep with you tonight, Grandma?

230
00:15:14.897 --> 00:15:18.130
Hey, I decorated your room like a princess' room,

231
00:15:18.134 --> 00:15:22.000
Why would you leave your room and sleep on my bed?

232
00:15:22.204 --> 00:15:24.610
I'm scared to sleep alone,

233
00:15:24.807 --> 00:15:27.810
Let me sleep here, Grandma,

234
00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:31.250
Oh, my goodness, Sure,

235
00:15:31.514 --> 00:15:34.450
I thought you were daring, but I guess you are still a kid,

236
00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:37.850
Sure, Go ahead, and sleep here, Lie down now,

237
00:15:38.788 --> 00:15:41.360
Let's sleep with Grandma now,

238
00:15:41.824 --> 00:15:43.520
There, there,

239
00:15:46.963 --> 00:15:48.100
All right,

240
00:15:49.332 --> 00:15:54.600
Life has three uphills

241
00:15:55.371 --> 00:15:59.510
What are these hills?

242
00:16:00.409 --> 00:16:05.250
Here are the winding hills

243
00:16:05.548 --> 00:16:10.280
You can climb over the hills

244
00:16:31.774 --> 00:16:32.940
All right,

245
00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:38.880
I raised that three-year-old baby who still had to wear a diaper,

246
00:16:39.849 --> 00:16:41.250
And I,,,

247
00:16:45.421 --> 00:16:48.520
lost him when he was about her age,

248
00:16:50.926 --> 00:16:52.130
I wonder,,,

249
00:16:53.329 --> 00:16:55.000
where on earth,,,

250
00:16:55.698 --> 00:16:59.500
he's living all by himself,

251
00:17:08.377 --> 00:17:09.480
My gosh,

252
00:17:09.912 --> 00:17:12.110
Han Gyul is sleeping here,

253
00:17:12.114 --> 00:17:13.810
I'll take her to her room,

254
00:17:13.883 --> 00:17:16.410
It's okay, Perhaps it's because her room changed,

255
00:17:16.419 --> 00:17:17.750
but she says she's scared,

256
00:17:17.753 --> 00:17:19.690
Leave her here, I'll sleep with her,

257
00:17:19.922 --> 00:17:21.650
But it might be uncomfortable for you,

258
00:17:21.657 --> 00:17:23.990
It's not a problem,

259
00:17:24.693 --> 00:17:28.960
By the way, how is the search for Eun Jo going?

260
00:17:29.598 --> 00:17:32.170
I got a call from the detective agency,

261
00:17:32.568 --> 00:17:35.270
They've found a possible guy,

262
00:17:36.072 --> 00:17:38.970
Really? And who is he?

263
00:17:38.974 --> 00:17:42.010
He seemed to take a train to Seoul when he went missing,

264
00:17:42.011 --> 00:17:44.150
so I searched through police stations near the Seoul Station,

265
00:17:44.713 --> 00:17:47.510
Fortunately, I found a document,,,

266
00:17:47.516 --> 00:17:49.080
in the nearby orphanage,

267
00:17:49.118 --> 00:17:53.050
So he followed the railroads,,,

268
00:17:53.689 --> 00:17:57.290
and ended up taking a train to Seoul,

269
00:17:57.426 --> 00:18:01.630
I searched everywhere in my hometown,

270
00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:03.760
That must've been why I couldn't find any trace of him,

271
00:18:04.366 --> 00:18:06.930
So where is he right now?

272
00:18:10.673 --> 00:18:13.310
It's the document which I found in the orphanage,

273
00:18:13.609 --> 00:18:16.070
(Child Record)

274
00:18:16.078 --> 00:18:17.680
"Kim Eun Jo",

275
00:18:17.847 --> 00:18:20.010
"Six years old", That's right,

276
00:18:20.416 --> 00:18:23.150
His first name and age are right,

277
00:18:23.152 --> 00:18:24.720
but why is his last name different?

278
00:18:25.187 --> 00:18:29.620
He must've been scared and confused,

279
00:18:29.625 --> 00:18:33.230
Or they might've used the director's last name to register him,

280
00:18:33.996 --> 00:18:38.260
So do we have to find him with this name now?

281
00:18:38.267 --> 00:18:42.240
Let's post an ad on the newspaper next morning,

282
00:18:42.505 --> 00:18:43.800
He was,,,

283
00:18:45.741 --> 00:18:47.470
adopted to the States,

284
00:18:48.677 --> 00:18:49.740
To the States?

285
00:18:50.613 --> 00:18:52.750
Are you talking about America?

286
00:18:53.115 --> 00:18:56.050
I requested about his whereabouts to the adoption agency,

287
00:18:56.185 --> 00:18:57.890
so please wait a little more,

288
00:18:58.654 --> 00:19:00.350
Gosh, my hands are shaking,

289
00:19:00.356 --> 00:19:04.620
If we had a photo of him, we might be able to look for him somehow,

290
00:19:04.627 --> 00:19:08.930
What if it's not him? What should we do then?

291
00:19:09.465 --> 00:19:12.930
Don't worry, Mom, You told us once,,,

292
00:19:12.935 --> 00:19:15.470
that destined people are meant to meet again,

293
00:19:15.471 --> 00:19:17.940
You'll meet him if you're destined,

294
00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:19.170
Don't worry, Mom,

295
00:19:19.175 --> 00:19:20.710
Right, Mother,

296
00:19:20.876 --> 00:19:22.670
They say you can't see right under your nose,

297
00:19:22.678 --> 00:19:25.980
We might be able to find him easily, so wait a little,

298
00:19:26.182 --> 00:19:28.950
It's okay, Mom, We'll be able to find him,

299
00:19:42.831 --> 00:19:44.930
Dad, why are you still here?

300
00:19:44.934 --> 00:19:46.700
What about you?

301
00:19:46.835 --> 00:19:49.300
We're about to leave work now,

302
00:19:54.443 --> 00:19:56.080
What were you looking at?

303
00:19:57.746 --> 00:19:59.210
You're looking at this picture again,

304
00:19:59.748 --> 00:20:01.910
I had this thought last time too,

305
00:20:01.917 --> 00:20:03.810
but his eyes and lips look just like you,

306
00:20:03.819 --> 00:20:07.190
You're curious about our family's history before your wedding,

307
00:20:07.289 --> 00:20:10.320
I look at this picture whenever I have time to remember my past,

308
00:20:10.326 --> 00:20:13.160
Did you remember anything?

309
00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:17.390
I'm not sure if she was my mom or sister,

310
00:20:17.399 --> 00:20:20.170
but a young woman is in my memory,

311
00:20:25.274 --> 00:20:26.470
Eun Jo,

312
00:20:30.646 --> 00:20:32.510
- It's good, - Is it?

313
00:20:48.063 --> 00:20:49.260
Eun Jo,

314
00:20:49.431 --> 00:20:50.560
Yes?

315
00:20:54.937 --> 00:20:56.730
What do you think? Do I look cool?

316
00:20:56.739 --> 00:20:58.310
Yes, you look cool,

317
00:21:00.709 --> 00:21:01.980
Like this,

318
00:21:06.649 --> 00:21:09.150
She adored me so much,

319
00:21:09.652 --> 00:21:12.520
Anyway, that's the only thing I remember,

320
00:21:12.655 --> 00:21:15.460
Why don't you try finding her?

321
00:21:15.924 --> 00:21:17.820
She must be old by now,

322
00:21:17.826 --> 00:21:20.490
but you'll be able to find her if she's alive,

323
00:21:20.529 --> 00:21:22.230
We'll try looking for her,

324
00:21:22.431 --> 00:21:24.470
No, like I told you before,

325
00:21:24.867 --> 00:21:27.160
I tried to find her once, but I failed,

326
00:21:27.169 --> 00:21:29.240
I don't want to be disappointed again,

327
00:21:29.938 --> 00:21:33.270
Anyway, how is it going with your preparation for the new launch?

328
00:21:33.942 --> 00:21:35.010
Yes,

329
00:21:35.411 --> 00:21:38.810
We worked late today because of the new menu,

330
00:21:38.814 --> 00:21:41.650
Good, the company is expecting a lot from you,

331
00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:44.010
So don't be distracted and work hard,

332
00:21:44.019 --> 00:21:46.180
Ru Ri, support him by his side,

333
00:21:46.188 --> 00:21:47.490
Yes, sir,

334
00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:52.960
Right, Father,

335
00:21:53.829 --> 00:21:55.460
I have something to ask,

336
00:21:55.464 --> 00:21:56.630
What is it?

337
00:21:56.699 --> 00:21:58.930
Among your acquaintances,

338
00:21:58.934 --> 00:22:01.640
does anyone have a burn scar on her face?

339
00:22:01.904 --> 00:22:03.240
A burn scar?

340
00:22:04.239 --> 00:22:05.640
What does she look like?

341
00:22:05.741 --> 00:22:09.140
She's probably in her mid-40s,

342
00:22:09.144 --> 00:22:10.910
She's a tall, pretty woman,

343
00:22:10.913 --> 00:22:12.550
Can you think of anyone?

344
00:22:13.182 --> 00:22:14.750
Well,,,

345
00:22:17.252 --> 00:22:18.620
I don't know,

346
00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:21.490
What about her?

347
00:22:22.124 --> 00:22:24.730
It's nothing, I ran into her by chance,

348
00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:27.230
and I'm wondering if she's your acquaintance,

349
00:22:27.596 --> 00:22:31.030
Okay, I'll tell you if she reminds me of someone,

350
00:24:14.069 --> 00:24:15.940
I'm back from the business,

351
00:24:17.673 --> 00:24:18.870
How did it go?

352
00:24:18.874 --> 00:24:21.070
Nothing suspicious was found,,,

353
00:24:21.076 --> 00:24:23.210
in Mr, Kim's studio where the accident took place,

354
00:24:23.712 --> 00:24:25.180
But I parked a car,,,

355
00:24:25.647 --> 00:24:29.320
at a garage of the hospital where Mr, Kim's hospitalized just in case,

356
00:24:30.018 --> 00:24:34.420
He seems to be much more dangerous than I expected,

357
00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:38.230
He recorded the conversation between Ae Ri and you,

358
00:24:38.427 --> 00:24:40.960
He must have other intentions or something,

359
00:24:41.763 --> 00:24:43.590
Until things are settled,

360
00:24:43.599 --> 00:24:46.600
isolate him from anyone in the company,

361
00:24:46.602 --> 00:24:47.940
Don't worry,

362
00:24:48.637 --> 00:24:50.800
He won't be out in the world for the time being,

363
00:24:55.577 --> 00:24:57.040
I told you,

364
00:24:57.913 --> 00:25:00.510
Until I have a dramatical reunion with Kevin,

365
00:25:00.916 --> 00:25:03.580
my identity should be kept in secret,

366
00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:07.890
I've prepared for three years for that moment,

367
00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:10.820
For the day when I meet again with Kevin,

368
00:25:11.426 --> 00:25:15.130
you can't make any mistakes, okay?

369
00:25:22.437 --> 00:25:24.470
If the chairman doesn't know her,

370
00:25:24.673 --> 00:25:26.210
who can she be?

371
00:25:27.409 --> 00:25:29.240
She kidnapped Mr, Kim,

372
00:25:29.244 --> 00:25:31.310
I'm sure she's working with Joo Ae Ri,

373
00:25:32.014 --> 00:25:33.950
How and where can I find her?

374
00:25:34.116 --> 00:25:36.780
How about we go to Mr, Kim's studio?

375
00:25:36.852 --> 00:25:38.620
He works for them,

376
00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:40.650
so there's got to be some kind of evidence,

377
00:25:41.223 --> 00:25:43.560
The problem is how we get in there,

378
00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:46.890
Get in, I have an idea,

379
00:25:50.132 --> 00:25:51.630
Unit 902?

380
00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:54.000
Yes, he's our colleague,

381
00:25:54.002 --> 00:25:56.600
He's hospitalized, so we're here to pick up his stuff,

382
00:25:56.972 --> 00:26:00.310
It's my business card, Let us in for a minute,

383
00:26:01.677 --> 00:26:03.780
SC Food and Beverage?

384
00:26:04.446 --> 00:26:06.980
Wait, someone from this company visited earlier,

385
00:26:06.982 --> 00:26:10.010
What? Who?

386
00:26:10.018 --> 00:26:12.320
He said that he came here to run an errand,

387
00:26:12.321 --> 00:26:14.760
He even brought the key too,

388
00:26:17.426 --> 00:26:18.990
So someone visited already,

389
00:26:18.994 --> 00:26:21.030
Then it's all solved,

390
00:26:23.332 --> 00:26:24.930
- Goodbye, - Bye,

391
00:26:27.069 --> 00:26:28.770
She had someone search through his studio,

392
00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:30.740
I'm sure she isn't a nobody,

393
00:26:31.173 --> 00:26:33.440
What does she have to do with the chairman?

394
00:26:38.513 --> 00:26:40.140
(Gangnam Detective Agency, Speed Planning)

395
00:26:40.148 --> 00:26:42.250
Gangnam Detective Speed Planning?

396
00:26:42.684 --> 00:26:45.720
Mr, Kim must have requested an investigation at a detective agency,

397
00:26:52.928 --> 00:26:54.230
It's Director Park,

398
00:26:55.664 --> 00:26:57.900
This woman's height and figure is similar,,,

399
00:26:58.433 --> 00:27:01.540
to the woman with the scar,

400
00:27:01.637 --> 00:27:03.700
We can't be sure because her face is covered,

401
00:27:04.573 --> 00:27:05.770
If it's that woman,

402
00:27:06.675 --> 00:27:09.040
Director Park must be one of them,

403
00:27:10.212 --> 00:27:14.010
Do you mean he pretended to be kind in front of the chairman,,,

404
00:27:14.650 --> 00:27:16.420
and conspired against him behind his back?

405
00:27:17.653 --> 00:27:19.990
He's a horrible man,

406
00:27:20.656 --> 00:27:22.390
Seeing that they're playing with other people's lives,

407
00:27:22.391 --> 00:27:23.490
it's probably something big,

408
00:27:24.593 --> 00:27:26.690
I have to find out what that is,

409
00:27:36.004 --> 00:27:38.470
Prepare 69,000 dollars until tomorrow,

410
00:27:39.007 --> 00:27:42.780
If you don't, I will reveal the secret of Han Gyul's birth,

411
00:27:53.722 --> 00:27:54.920
Hello?

412
00:27:55.157 --> 00:27:56.490
Did you prepare the money?

413
00:27:56.825 --> 00:27:59.260
Put it in the place I told you until 11am,

414
00:27:59.728 --> 00:28:02.430
Wait a minute, I don't know who you are, but,,,

415
00:28:02.431 --> 00:28:03.560
Until 11am,

416
00:28:04.933 --> 00:28:07.030
Hello?

417
00:28:11.173 --> 00:28:13.970
The person you're trying to reach,,,

418
00:28:14.943 --> 00:28:16.080
What should I do?

419
00:28:24.086 --> 00:28:25.950
I need 69,000 dollars,

420
00:28:26.421 --> 00:28:27.720
If you give me that money,

421
00:28:28.423 --> 00:28:29.820
I won't appear again,

422
00:28:32.661 --> 00:28:34.630
How could she stoop so low?

423
00:28:38.633 --> 00:28:39.830
Honey,

424
00:28:40.635 --> 00:28:44.040
You'll have to go to work by yourself today,

425
00:28:44.673 --> 00:28:46.470
I don't think I'll be able to go to the store,

426
00:28:47.175 --> 00:28:49.440
What's wrong? Are you worried about something?

427
00:28:50.679 --> 00:28:52.480
That's not it,

428
00:28:54.716 --> 00:28:57.820
Did anything happen to you? You're happy, right?

429
00:28:59.721 --> 00:29:02.490
Of course, I'm with you like this,

430
00:29:02.724 --> 00:29:04.060
Why would I have any worries?

431
00:29:04.326 --> 00:29:05.530
I've never felt better,

432
00:29:07.162 --> 00:29:09.030
Okay, that's good then,

433
00:29:09.564 --> 00:29:11.500
As long as you're happy, I'm happy,

434
00:29:13.068 --> 00:29:14.630
Why would you say that?

435
00:29:15.637 --> 00:29:17.030
Tell me if you have any worries,

436
00:29:17.038 --> 00:29:18.970
I'll deal with it for you, What is it?

437
00:29:20.509 --> 00:29:22.380
It's nothing,

438
00:29:23.478 --> 00:29:24.740
I'm just scared,,,

439
00:29:24.746 --> 00:29:28.380
that this happiness will be ruined,

440
00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:30.780
You're silly,

441
00:29:33.922 --> 00:29:36.320
I love you very much,

442
00:29:47.068 --> 00:29:48.300
Yeon Ju,

443
00:29:48.937 --> 00:29:50.640
Yes?

444
00:29:50.772 --> 00:29:53.470
You spoiled my appetite from early in the morning,

445
00:29:54.309 --> 00:29:55.510
Why?

446
00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:58.580
Come down, Han Gyul is a little strange,

447
00:29:59.381 --> 00:30:00.550
Han Gyul is strange?

448
00:30:07.689 --> 00:30:09.260
What am I going to do?

449
00:30:09.424 --> 00:30:11.420
I peed in bed,

450
00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:14.730
How do you take care of your kid?

451
00:30:15.864 --> 00:30:17.430
Is she sick?

452
00:30:24.072 --> 00:30:25.840
Han Gyul, are you sick?

453
00:30:26.208 --> 00:30:28.140
No, I'm not sick,

454
00:30:28.176 --> 00:30:29.640
Why aren't you getting up then?

455
00:30:29.644 --> 00:30:31.980
I heard you told Grandma that you weren't going to school,

456
00:30:32.414 --> 00:30:35.450
Yes, I'm sick here,

457
00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:40.920
That's strange, She doesn't have a fever,

458
00:30:41.156 --> 00:30:43.220
Tell us clearly,

459
00:30:43.558 --> 00:30:45.530
Do you have a headache or not?

460
00:30:45.627 --> 00:30:48.500
Sometimes it hurts, and sometimes it doesn't,

461
00:30:50.699 --> 00:30:53.330
What is this smell?

462
00:30:54.135 --> 00:30:56.970
I think I can smell the stench of urine,

463
00:30:57.772 --> 00:31:00.570
I think you're right, What smell is this?

464
00:31:00.909 --> 00:31:03.740
I didn't pee,

465
00:31:05.013 --> 00:31:07.310
Han Gyul, wait a minute,

466
00:31:11.419 --> 00:31:12.550
Oh, my,

467
00:31:14.155 --> 00:31:15.720
Oh, my, What is this?

468
00:31:16.858 --> 00:31:19.730
No, I didn't pee,

469
00:31:20.862 --> 00:31:24.560
I didn't pee,

470
00:31:24.633 --> 00:31:28.300
Okay, you didn't pee,

471
00:31:28.603 --> 00:31:30.930
I have urinary incontinence,

472
00:31:30.939 --> 00:31:33.200
so I made a mistake,

473
00:31:33.208 --> 00:31:36.110
It's a mistake, I peed,

474
00:31:36.111 --> 00:31:37.840
Do you understand?

475
00:31:38.246 --> 00:31:41.980
Really? Mom, why did you do that?

476
00:31:42.851 --> 00:31:46.550
Oh, my, I guess I have to do laundry in this cold weather,

477
00:31:48.156 --> 00:31:51.190
Mrs, Yang, only people who are about to die,,,

478
00:31:51.192 --> 00:31:53.330
makes this kind of mistakes,

479
00:31:53.828 --> 00:31:56.190
You can take care of this problem without any side effects,,,

480
00:31:56.197 --> 00:31:58.670
within 15 minutes by having surgery,

481
00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:00.700
Don't cause trouble for me,

482
00:32:00.702 --> 00:32:03.230
and go to the hospital right away to take care of it,

483
00:32:03.238 --> 00:32:04.800
Can't you shut your mouth?

484
00:32:05.173 --> 00:32:06.940
My bladder isn't important,

485
00:32:06.942 --> 00:32:10.180
We need to sew your mouth up first,

486
00:32:16.217 --> 00:32:19.490
That's strange, She's never done this before,

487
00:32:19.921 --> 00:32:22.720
I heard that kids make mistakes when they're stressed,

488
00:32:22.824 --> 00:32:24.960
Is it because of the sudden environment change?

489
00:32:25.894 --> 00:32:27.090
Stress?

490
00:32:30.498 --> 00:32:32.700
- Dad, - It's okay,

491
00:32:35.503 --> 00:32:38.170
Can you stay at home and comfort Han Gyul today?

492
00:32:38.673 --> 00:32:39.870
What about you?

493
00:32:40.241 --> 00:32:41.780
I have to go somewhere,

494
00:33:00.161 --> 00:33:01.760
Place the money in 50 dollar bills,,,

495
00:33:01.763 --> 00:33:04.060
in the trash can of the "out of order" stall,,,

496
00:33:04.199 --> 00:33:06.700
of the Cheongdam Park bathroom,

497
00:33:07.469 --> 00:33:08.970
If you violate this,

498
00:33:09.204 --> 00:33:12.140
I'm going to spread the truth at her school,

499
00:33:16.311 --> 00:33:17.540
What should I do?

500
00:33:23.151 --> 00:33:25.290
(Bankbook balance 12,500 dollars)

501
00:33:27.188 --> 00:33:29.690
How can I manage to suddenly get such a large sum of money?

502
00:33:30.859 --> 00:33:32.130
My goodness,

503
00:33:33.728 --> 00:33:35.300
Who do you want to visit?

504
00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:37.760
Inmate 601, Jung Su Mi,

505
00:33:45.173 --> 00:33:46.570
She's not here right now,

506
00:33:47.308 --> 00:33:49.440
Did she transfer to another place?

507
00:33:49.978 --> 00:33:52.180
No, she was released on parole a month ago,

508
00:33:53.248 --> 00:33:54.410
What?

509
00:33:56.017 --> 00:33:58.180
Can I have her contact number?

510
00:33:58.686 --> 00:34:01.920
I'm sorry, I can't tell you that to protect her privacy,

511
00:34:02.957 --> 00:34:04.120
Wait a minute,

512
00:34:11.199 --> 00:34:12.730
(Lee So Won)

513
00:34:15.103 --> 00:34:17.070
This is a photo of Jung Su Mi's daughter,

514
00:34:17.272 --> 00:34:18.510
Please give this to her,

515
00:34:19.441 --> 00:34:21.710
I have to meet her, Tell her to call me,

516
00:34:24.379 --> 00:34:25.510
Okay,

517
00:34:36.858 --> 00:34:38.120
69,000 dollars?

518
00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:41.290
Yes, I need that money right now,

519
00:34:41.296 --> 00:34:43.490
Hurry, I really need that money,

520
00:34:43.498 --> 00:34:44.900
Hurry,

521
00:34:44.999 --> 00:34:47.330
Gosh, calm down,

522
00:34:47.502 --> 00:34:51.940
Why do you need 69,000 dollars? Is there a new crocodile bag?

523
00:34:52.307 --> 00:34:54.700
Buy something like that with your credit card,

524
00:34:54.709 --> 00:34:56.640
You can decrease tax that way,

525
00:34:57.378 --> 00:35:00.310
No, Mom, It's not like that,

526
00:35:00.482 --> 00:35:03.010
I don't have time for this, Please give me the money,

527
00:35:03.017 --> 00:35:06.450
I need it in 50 dollar bills in cash, Hurry,

528
00:35:06.521 --> 00:35:09.290
Why are you keep asking me for cash?

529
00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:10.960
Am I your safe?

530
00:35:11.192 --> 00:35:12.890
I don't have time for this,

531
00:35:13.061 --> 00:35:16.060
Wait a minute, The combination for your safe was 8282, right?

532
00:35:18.733 --> 00:35:23.700
Why do you need that money so suddenly? What are you going to do?

533
00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:27.110
Tell me,

534
00:35:27.642 --> 00:35:30.010
Why do you need that money? What is it?

535
00:35:30.979 --> 00:35:32.640
Mom, please,

536
00:35:32.647 --> 00:35:34.480
Confess,

537
00:35:35.083 --> 00:35:38.180
Why do you need that money? Why do you need it in cash? Tell me,

538
00:35:54.836 --> 00:35:56.900
I know all about Han Gyul's birth,

539
00:35:57.138 --> 00:36:00.510
Unless you want to be humiliated in the kindergarten, do as I say,

540
00:36:02.977 --> 00:36:05.040
What is this all of a sudden?

541
00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:07.050
What should we do?

542
00:36:10.251 --> 00:36:12.650
She was a model prisoner, and she had a young daughter,

543
00:36:12.787 --> 00:36:14.920
She was released on parole because she had extenuating circumstances,

544
00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:21.630
She used her child to be released on parole,

545
00:36:22.163 --> 00:36:24.300
Now she's asking her sister to extort money from us?

546
00:36:25.733 --> 00:36:29.100
Jung Su Mi, how could you do that as a human being?

547
00:36:34.642 --> 00:36:36.270
We can't be late, Mom,

548
00:36:36.277 --> 00:36:38.580
She said she'll spread the rumor if we're late even for one minute,

549
00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:42.210
Don't worry, I'll give her the money,

550
00:36:42.217 --> 00:36:44.750
but once I catch her,

551
00:36:44.752 --> 00:36:47.850
I'm going to tear up her body,

552
00:37:14.215 --> 00:37:16.180
Mom, I think it's here,

553
00:37:20.488 --> 00:37:21.590
Let's go,

554
00:37:37.605 --> 00:37:38.710
(Cheongdam Park)

555
00:38:06.167 --> 00:38:08.170
It's done, Mom, What time is it?

556
00:38:09.937 --> 00:38:11.600
It's almost 11,

557
00:38:12.807 --> 00:38:14.200
What do we do now?

558
00:38:14.208 --> 00:38:16.780
We need to be patient now,

559
00:38:17.045 --> 00:38:19.050
Trust and follow me,

560
00:39:19.774 --> 00:39:21.270
You thief,

561
00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:26.710
Su Ji,

562
00:39:27.448 --> 00:39:29.380
Gosh, I can't believe it,

563
00:39:29.917 --> 00:39:32.350
That's right, It was me,

564
00:39:32.854 --> 00:39:35.520
If I knew this would happen, I should've just met with you,

565
00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:37.260
But it doesn't matter,

566
00:39:37.291 --> 00:39:41.030
It's true that I know about Han Gyul's birth,

567
00:39:41.896 --> 00:39:43.160
What?

568
00:39:43.598 --> 00:39:46.260
Who are you? How do you know all that?

569
00:39:46.267 --> 00:39:48.500
Ask your husband if you're curious,

570
00:39:48.536 --> 00:39:50.900
He knows me better than anyone else,

571
00:39:50.938 --> 00:39:53.940
Who are you? Who are you?

572
00:39:53.941 --> 00:39:55.770
Who are you, witch? Who are you?

573
00:39:55.777 --> 00:39:57.710
How dare you lay your hand on me?

574
00:39:58.179 --> 00:40:00.150
I'll keep your secret,

575
00:40:00.681 --> 00:40:03.820
But you have to be nice to Han Gyul,

576
00:40:04.185 --> 00:40:05.750
Don't be a mean stepmother,

577
00:40:07.789 --> 00:40:11.120
You thief, Who are you?

578
00:40:11.125 --> 00:40:12.690
Who are you?

579
00:40:12.693 --> 00:40:15.290
How dare you threaten my daughter?

580
00:40:15.296 --> 00:40:16.730
- Who are you? - Mom,

581
00:40:16.731 --> 00:40:19.360
Who are you?

582
00:40:19.367 --> 00:40:20.760
Mom, Please stop,

583
00:40:20.768 --> 00:40:23.130
- Mom, Calm down, - You witch,

584
00:40:23.137 --> 00:40:25.940
Are you out of your mind? How dare you hit me?

585
00:40:27.008 --> 00:40:30.140
Don't you know what happens when I tell the truth?

586
00:40:30.411 --> 00:40:34.010
If you do this one more time, I'm going to tell everyone,

587
00:40:35.049 --> 00:40:36.420
What? You,,,

588
00:40:42.023 --> 00:40:45.020
Honey, How did you find this place?

589
00:40:49.597 --> 00:40:50.860
You piece of trash,

590
00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:01.370
What is this?

591
00:41:21.963 --> 00:41:23.930
Were you humiliated last night?

592
00:41:23.931 --> 00:41:26.860
So why would you have an affair,,,

593
00:41:26.868 --> 00:41:28.670
at that age?

594
00:41:29.003 --> 00:41:31.130
You don't know what you've got until you've lost it,

595
00:41:31.138 --> 00:41:33.770
Drink and reflect on yourself,

596
00:41:34.308 --> 00:41:36.010
Gosh,

597
00:41:36.143 --> 00:41:40.410
How does that granny know?

598
00:41:45.753 --> 00:41:48.750
When my husband finds out what kind of person you are,

599
00:41:48.923 --> 00:41:50.960
he will get hurt and be disappointed,

600
00:41:51.759 --> 00:41:53.290
I want to stop it,

601
00:41:56.697 --> 00:41:58.800
Come on, Lee Shin Mo,

602
00:41:59.433 --> 00:42:00.830
You're pathetic,

603
00:42:01.936 --> 00:42:05.000
Where is this?

604
00:42:05.673 --> 00:42:07.510
Who am I?

605
00:42:12.413 --> 00:42:13.550
Honey,

606
00:42:14.415 --> 00:42:15.480
Honey,

607
00:42:16.017 --> 00:42:17.980
Seriously,

608
00:42:18.986 --> 00:42:20.680
I knew it,

609
00:42:20.688 --> 00:42:23.520
What are you doing? Get ready,

610
00:42:24.158 --> 00:42:25.320
Get ready?

611
00:42:26.394 --> 00:42:28.190
For what?

612
00:42:30.231 --> 00:42:32.930
Here, Put this on today,

613
00:42:33.868 --> 00:42:37.500
I bought you a new arrival with money I saved up from lectures,

614
00:42:38.773 --> 00:42:41.370
You didn't have to,

615
00:42:42.543 --> 00:42:44.880
It's a happy day today,

616
00:42:45.413 --> 00:42:48.340
You're meeting your future in-laws today,

617
00:42:48.349 --> 00:42:49.680
You should dress up,

618
00:42:52.753 --> 00:42:53.990
Aren't you upset?

619
00:42:54.855 --> 00:42:56.450
You're Tae Yang's father,

620
00:42:56.457 --> 00:42:58.020
but I'm going to Chairman Kevin,

621
00:42:58.893 --> 00:43:01.760
I know, I'm so jealous,,,

622
00:43:02.063 --> 00:43:03.560
that I can't stop crying,

623
00:43:06.367 --> 00:43:09.070
I'm sorry, but,,,

624
00:43:09.937 --> 00:43:12.840
you can be the father when Woo Joo gets married,

625
00:43:14.275 --> 00:43:15.840
Depending on how you behave,

626
00:43:17.979 --> 00:43:19.880
Is this enough?

627
00:43:20.748 --> 00:43:23.880
No, I'm Go Jung Do,

628
00:43:24.418 --> 00:43:25.480
Wait,

629
00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:27.590
- That was lame, - Come here,

630
00:43:28.789 --> 00:43:30.450
Mom, How do I look?

631
00:43:30.458 --> 00:43:31.960
Oh, yes,

632
00:43:32.526 --> 00:43:34.960
Did you just do something cheesy?

633
00:43:35.696 --> 00:43:38.560
I haven't seen that embarrassing situation for a long time,

634
00:43:38.566 --> 00:43:40.800
I'm so touched that I want to cry,

635
00:43:44.105 --> 00:43:46.600
What? That's today?

636
00:43:46.607 --> 00:43:50.070
How can you forget such an important day?

637
00:43:50.077 --> 00:43:51.940
Go shower, We don't have time,

638
00:43:51.946 --> 00:43:54.840
Gosh, I must be getting old,

639
00:43:54.849 --> 00:43:58.480
I keep forgetting everything, I don't remember a thing,

640
00:43:58.719 --> 00:44:02.520
What do you mean? You're dating a young woman,

641
00:44:03.958 --> 00:44:07.030
I'll get your clothes, Go get ready,

642
00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:11.800
What's wrong with you?

643
00:44:12.166 --> 00:44:14.900
Are you stunned after meeting your first love?

644
00:44:17.004 --> 00:44:20.270
Let me say this one thing,

645
00:44:21.308 --> 00:44:23.070
Stop dating her,,,

646
00:44:23.077 --> 00:44:25.380
because I'm jealous,

647
00:44:25.746 --> 00:44:27.410
I'll return the car,,,

648
00:44:27.415 --> 00:44:30.250
and freeze to death in this weather from taking the bus,

649
00:44:30.251 --> 00:44:32.920
Get it? Go get ready,

650
00:44:38.059 --> 00:44:40.360
What are you doing? It's disgusting,

651
00:44:43.998 --> 00:44:47.000
Is everything all right?

652
00:44:47.001 --> 00:44:49.340
I've realized it this time,

653
00:44:50.504 --> 00:44:54.110
You're better than me,

654
00:44:56.577 --> 00:45:00.910
I take back calling you stupid,

655
00:45:01.716 --> 00:45:04.250
I'm the stupid one,

656
00:45:05.019 --> 00:45:08.090
You're not an idiot daughter or an idiot wife,

657
00:45:08.956 --> 00:45:11.760
but I'm the idiot dad and idiot husband,

658
00:45:12.793 --> 00:45:15.290
Stupid Lee Shin Mo,

659
00:45:17.398 --> 00:45:18.560
Honey,

660
00:45:19.366 --> 00:45:21.230
I heard it all,

661
00:45:21.502 --> 00:45:24.570
What you told Theresa,

662
00:45:25.773 --> 00:45:30.110
I'm very sorry, I'm ashamed,

663
00:45:31.545 --> 00:45:32.880
Goodness,

664
00:45:34.148 --> 00:45:35.920
You've changed a lot,

665
00:45:36.250 --> 00:45:39.520
You'd yell at me not to care in the past,

666
00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:42.960
You admit your fault now, That's amazing,

667
00:45:43.157 --> 00:45:45.860
You're great, Shin Mo,

668
00:45:47.194 --> 00:45:48.360
Thank you,

669
00:45:49.163 --> 00:45:50.960
Are you teasing me?

670
00:45:51.465 --> 00:45:53.430
Okay, I'll go get ready,

671
00:46:04.912 --> 00:46:06.810
Did you bring what I asked?

672
00:46:16.457 --> 00:46:18.220
Is this Anna?

673
00:46:18.759 --> 00:46:21.030
Korean name Jung Hwa Young?

674
00:46:21.228 --> 00:46:22.360
Yes,

675
00:46:22.930 --> 00:46:25.800
She's the woman Chairman Kevin missed for his whole life,

676
00:46:26.667 --> 00:46:28.330
She's nothing special,

677
00:46:28.602 --> 00:46:31.740
Is she the reason why he left everything behind,,,

678
00:46:31.772 --> 00:46:33.510
to come to Korea?

679
00:46:34.775 --> 00:46:36.780
She's living with a man too,

680
00:46:37.044 --> 00:46:39.250
The chairman wants to get back with her desperately,

681
00:46:39.547 --> 00:46:42.650
but she wants to keep her family,

682
00:46:43.717 --> 00:46:45.580
How satisfying, Kevin Miller,

683
00:46:47.188 --> 00:46:48.690
He must be the son,

684
00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:51.320
I see, Jung Tae Yang,

685
00:46:51.559 --> 00:46:53.530
Chairman Miller's guess was right,

686
00:46:54.061 --> 00:46:57.260
When she left, she was pregnant,

687
00:46:58.098 --> 00:47:01.300
Come to think, I think I ran into him in the hospital,

688
00:47:07.208 --> 00:47:11.280
He seems pretty clever, seeing how he went there,

689
00:47:11.579 --> 00:47:13.150
Blood is thicker than water after all,

690
00:47:14.248 --> 00:47:18.250
He's so cold-hearted, but he relies on his son very much,

691
00:47:19.186 --> 00:47:22.760
He even threw his body,,,

692
00:47:23.123 --> 00:47:25.120
at a running car to save his son,

693
00:47:26.794 --> 00:47:28.460
Let him be happy all he wants,

694
00:47:28.829 --> 00:47:32.030
Both the father and son will collapse like a tsunami soon,

695
00:47:41.809 --> 00:47:45.740
Hello, I'm the youngest sister of Tae Yang, Go Eun Byul,

696
00:47:48.749 --> 00:47:50.880
I'm the second, Kim Woo Joo,

697
00:47:53.487 --> 00:47:56.020
They all have different last names,

698
00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:57.760
Do they have different fathers?

699
00:47:58.459 --> 00:48:00.320
I'll tell you later,

700
00:48:00.327 --> 00:48:01.590
Okay,

701
00:48:02.796 --> 00:48:04.360
I'm so happy today,

702
00:48:06.433 --> 00:48:09.670
Ru Ri's father was against this marriage at first,

703
00:48:10.938 --> 00:48:13.710
Then my parents were against it,

704
00:48:15.042 --> 00:48:17.740
But we weren't shaken and trusted each other,

705
00:48:18.312 --> 00:48:21.110
I'm grateful to Ru Ri for staying by my side,

706
00:48:22.716 --> 00:48:26.250
I'm so happy and grateful too,

707
00:48:28.088 --> 00:48:30.760
You look so nice, I like you,

708
00:48:31.258 --> 00:48:32.420
I like you too,

709
00:48:34.895 --> 00:48:38.500
We're happy to see you happy,

710
00:48:39.333 --> 00:48:41.500
- Right, Mr, Lee? - Of course,

711
00:48:41.502 --> 00:48:44.170
I'm so touched,

712
00:48:45.639 --> 00:48:47.610
You must've been surprised a while ago,,,

713
00:48:48.142 --> 00:48:50.780
to find all our three kids with different last names,

714
00:48:52.179 --> 00:48:55.150
I got married three times,

715
00:48:58.686 --> 00:48:59.880
I see,

716
00:48:59.887 --> 00:49:02.490
It can happen in life,

717
00:49:05.259 --> 00:49:08.030
That's why I respect you two sincerely,

718
00:49:09.596 --> 00:49:11.860
I'm envious all my life,,,

719
00:49:12.833 --> 00:49:17.340
of those who remember each other's youth and grow old together,

720
00:49:17.938 --> 00:49:19.670
I couldn't do it,

721
00:49:19.707 --> 00:49:22.440
but I'm so grateful,,,

722
00:49:22.643 --> 00:49:24.880
that a daughter from such a precious family,,,

723
00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:27.980
is going to become my son's wife,

724
00:49:30.184 --> 00:49:31.580
Don't mention it,

725
00:49:31.819 --> 00:49:34.990
We have a lot of problems too,

726
00:49:35.789 --> 00:49:38.960
No, I'm well aware that you're a devoted couple,

727
00:49:40.327 --> 00:49:43.300
Mr, Lee, do you remember me?

728
00:49:44.231 --> 00:49:45.400
Pardon?

729
00:49:45.466 --> 00:49:49.070
Well, have we met before?

730
00:49:49.503 --> 00:49:51.570
I remembered recently too,

731
00:49:51.772 --> 00:49:55.210
The day when you retired from work, you came to my dance studio,

732
00:49:55.609 --> 00:49:57.280
Your dance studio?

733
00:49:58.412 --> 00:49:59.810
Are you going to learn alone?

734
00:49:59.813 --> 00:50:01.910
You need to have a partner to learn dance sports,

735
00:50:01.915 --> 00:50:03.580
I'm going to do it with my wife,

736
00:50:04.251 --> 00:50:06.690
I'm here to register as a surprise gift for her,

737
00:50:06.754 --> 00:50:08.250
A surprise gift?

738
00:50:10.457 --> 00:50:12.520
Oh, right,

739
00:50:12.926 --> 00:50:15.390
You're that teacher,

740
00:50:15.562 --> 00:50:19.630
Honey, do you remember when I told you,,,

741
00:50:19.666 --> 00:50:21.600
to learn dance sports together?

742
00:50:21.602 --> 00:50:23.200
She's that instructor,

743
00:50:25.372 --> 00:50:28.470
Oh, my goodness, How could this happen?

744
00:50:30.577 --> 00:50:34.150
Tae Yang and Ru Ri are meant to be together,

745
00:50:34.314 --> 00:50:37.080
Don't be like us no matter how hard it gets,

746
00:50:37.418 --> 00:50:39.780
You should love and support each other all your lives,,,

747
00:50:39.787 --> 00:50:42.350
like Ru Ri's parents, okay?

748
00:50:42.689 --> 00:50:44.460
Okay, I'll keep it in mind,

749
00:50:45.392 --> 00:50:46.790
Me too,

750
00:50:47.461 --> 00:50:51.400
It's my life's regret that I couldn't have a peaceful family,

751
00:50:51.965 --> 00:50:54.330
Invite me for dinner some time,

752
00:50:54.568 --> 00:50:56.570
I'd like to have a Korean meal,,,

753
00:50:56.937 --> 00:50:59.170
and experience how a happy family is like,

754
00:50:59.873 --> 00:51:02.510
Of course, we will,

755
00:51:03.310 --> 00:51:07.480
Well, but,,, Actually,,,

756
00:51:07.481 --> 00:51:09.010
- Honey, - Well,,,

757
00:51:09.616 --> 00:51:13.580
We'll invite you in the near future,,,

758
00:51:13.587 --> 00:51:16.520
and set an official family gathering,

759
00:51:17.758 --> 00:51:20.390
Shouldn't we clap and have a toast at times like this?

760
00:51:20.727 --> 00:51:22.630
That's right,

761
00:51:23.797 --> 00:51:24.900
Congratulations,

762
00:51:34.942 --> 00:51:36.440
Did you enjoy your meal?

763
00:51:36.577 --> 00:51:38.710
You did a great job in selecting this place,

764
00:51:38.712 --> 00:51:40.150
We had a great time thanks to you,

765
00:51:41.482 --> 00:51:43.080
You should go first,

766
00:51:43.217 --> 00:51:45.510
We have to go back to the office because of the new menu,

767
00:51:45.519 --> 00:51:48.450
No, I'd like to see you off today,

768
00:51:49.123 --> 00:51:50.320
Go in first,

769
00:51:51.024 --> 00:51:53.130
Okay, then, I'll see you later,

770
00:51:53.927 --> 00:51:55.090
Let's go,

771
00:51:57.998 --> 00:52:01.070
Thank you for being my daughter-in-law,

772
00:52:03.871 --> 00:52:06.610
Thank you, Father,

773
00:52:08.609 --> 00:52:09.840
Okay, bye,

774
00:52:10.410 --> 00:52:11.610
Let's go,

775
00:52:30.597 --> 00:52:31.860
What's wrong, sir?

776
00:52:35.502 --> 00:52:36.700
Wait here,

777
00:52:57.024 --> 00:52:58.920
Among your acquaintances,

778
00:52:59.193 --> 00:53:01.730
does anyone have a burn scar on her face?

779
00:53:02.462 --> 00:53:03.660
A burn scar?

780
00:53:04.464 --> 00:53:05.560
What does she look like?

781
00:53:06.266 --> 00:53:09.430
She's probably in her mid-40s,

782
00:53:09.536 --> 00:53:11.300
She's a tall, pretty woman,

783
00:53:14.441 --> 00:53:15.710
No way,

784
00:53:16.577 --> 00:53:18.040
How can a dead person,,,

785
00:53:27.020 --> 00:53:28.420
Kevin Miller,

786
00:53:30.157 --> 00:53:31.860
I wanted to check with my eyes,,,

787
00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:35.490
just how happy you are without me,

788
00:53:50.177 --> 00:53:52.780
I think it's him,

789
00:53:56.683 --> 00:53:57.820
Excuse me,

790
00:54:06.927 --> 00:54:08.130
Are you Lee Myung Rang?

791
00:54:08.629 --> 00:54:11.960
Right, are you from Speed Planning?

792
00:54:12.065 --> 00:54:13.170
What's your business?

793
00:54:14.067 --> 00:54:15.830
Mr, Kim,,, I mean,

794
00:54:16.436 --> 00:54:19.710
Kim Dong Il requested for a case, didn't he?

795
00:54:19.906 --> 00:54:21.570
I'm here to ask you something,

796
00:54:23.210 --> 00:54:24.880
Oh, this,

797
00:54:28.715 --> 00:54:30.580
It's your doing, right?

798
00:54:31.585 --> 00:54:33.850
What about this? Did anything go wrong?

799
00:54:34.855 --> 00:54:36.460
The woman covered in bandages,

800
00:54:36.857 --> 00:54:38.260
What's her name,,,

801
00:54:38.659 --> 00:54:40.390
and what's her job?

802
00:54:48.268 --> 00:54:49.670
Look at it more closely,

803
00:55:03.083 --> 00:55:05.820
Chairman Kevin, this is the agenda for the directors' meeting tomorrow,

804
00:55:09.790 --> 00:55:11.020
I saw Susanna,

805
00:55:11.458 --> 00:55:12.620
Pardon?

806
00:55:14.328 --> 00:55:15.790
What are you talking about?

807
00:55:17.831 --> 00:55:19.660
Tae Yang said he saw her too,

808
00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:21.630
I saw her a few minutes ago too,

809
00:55:21.935 --> 00:55:23.100
How did this happen?

810
00:55:25.772 --> 00:55:28.970
I don't know, I did confirm her dead,

811
00:55:30.944 --> 00:55:33.640
Maybe you're mistaken with someone else,

812
00:55:33.647 --> 00:55:35.380
I'm sure it was Susanna,

813
00:55:35.916 --> 00:55:37.650
She died of fire, right?

814
00:55:37.851 --> 00:55:40.420
I saw a burn scar on her face too,

815
00:55:42.689 --> 00:55:45.320
It's already been three years since she died,

816
00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:50.230
You must be mistaken because of the burden in your heart,

817
00:55:54.368 --> 00:55:55.530
Is that so?

818
00:56:01.508 --> 00:56:03.940
It's a plan for the new menu to show at the launch,

819
00:56:04.211 --> 00:56:06.140
Our focus is healthy food,

820
00:56:06.847 --> 00:56:09.410
We need to bring our new branch to a success somehow,

821
00:56:10.183 --> 00:56:13.250
It's my first project to prove how qualified I am as the successor,

822
00:56:14.521 --> 00:56:16.860
Don't worry, You can do this,

823
00:56:16.957 --> 00:56:18.360
You have me,

824
00:56:19.626 --> 00:56:20.760
Manager Jung,

825
00:56:22.195 --> 00:56:24.860
We finally found out about who that woman is,

826
00:56:25.565 --> 00:56:26.660
Who is she?

827
00:56:26.666 --> 00:56:29.840
She got treated for her burn injury for three years in a hospital,

828
00:56:29.870 --> 00:56:31.670
She had three operations,

829
00:56:31.872 --> 00:56:33.570
So who is she?

830
00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:35.540
They're still investigating that,

831
00:56:35.542 --> 00:56:38.140
Her name is Lee Kyung Hwa,

832
00:56:38.445 --> 00:56:39.540
Lee Kyung Hwa?

833
00:56:40.414 --> 00:56:41.650
Wait,

834
00:56:42.582 --> 00:56:44.380
I've seen that name before,

835
00:56:44.985 --> 00:56:46.080
Where did you see it?

836
00:56:50.357 --> 00:56:54.460
(Executives)

837
00:57:00.834 --> 00:57:02.360
(Strategic Business Team)

838
00:57:02.369 --> 00:57:04.370
(Team Manager Lee Kyung Hwa)

839
00:57:04.371 --> 00:57:05.670
That's the one,

840
00:57:05.872 --> 00:57:08.440
The investment team manger at Goldman Partners,

841
00:57:08.542 --> 00:57:09.840
Lee Kyung Hwa,

842
00:57:10.143 --> 00:57:11.780
Goldman Partners?

843
00:57:12.045 --> 00:57:14.810
They invest in our company,

844
00:57:15.081 --> 00:57:16.150
You're right,

845
00:57:16.983 --> 00:57:18.410
When we entered Beijing,

846
00:57:18.418 --> 00:57:20.420
we joined them as a mutual company,

847
00:57:21.121 --> 00:57:24.760
Why would their executive want to harm Chairman Kevin?

848
00:57:24.858 --> 00:57:26.220
If our company goes bankrupt,

849
00:57:26.226 --> 00:57:29.490
they won't be able to get their money back and go bankrupt too,

850
00:57:30.397 --> 00:57:31.460
I know,

851
00:57:32.732 --> 00:57:34.500
If it's her for sure,

852
00:57:34.968 --> 00:57:36.800
there must be something we don't know,

853
00:57:50.250 --> 00:57:52.820
Are you angry, Honey?

854
00:57:53.186 --> 00:57:56.860
Why didn't you tell me that you're getting threatened?

855
00:57:57.691 --> 00:57:59.890
I didn't want you to be upset,

856
00:57:59.926 --> 00:58:01.820
We just became happy,

857
00:58:01.828 --> 00:58:05.860
I didn't want to make you worried,

858
00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:08.730
So I tried to deal with it alone,

859
00:58:17.577 --> 00:58:21.480
Why didn't you tell me about her even though you knew?

860
00:58:22.249 --> 00:58:23.480
I'm the same,

861
00:58:24.751 --> 00:58:27.690
You just settled after suffering because of me,

862
00:58:28.488 --> 00:58:30.360
I didn't want to make you suffer again,

863
00:58:34.294 --> 00:58:35.390
Ha Yeon Ju,

864
00:58:36.129 --> 00:58:38.990
From next time, no matter how small it is,

865
00:58:38.999 --> 00:58:41.900
don't try to deal with it alone, Leave it up to me,

866
00:58:42.102 --> 00:58:43.500
I'll deal with it,

867
00:58:44.137 --> 00:58:48.270
No, Then let's do it together,

868
00:58:50.043 --> 00:58:51.140
Okay,

869
00:59:01.288 --> 00:59:03.850
What are you doing here, Mom? What about that girl?

870
00:59:03.857 --> 00:59:05.890
I don't know, I've been yelling at her,

871
00:59:05.892 --> 00:59:09.490
but she won't say anything as if her lips are glued,

872
00:59:10.096 --> 00:59:12.460
Don't worry, I'll find out,

873
00:59:13.733 --> 00:59:15.530
Where Jung Su Mi is,

874
00:59:21.942 --> 00:59:26.440
- Mom, - Mom,

875
00:59:26.446 --> 00:59:27.880
Han Gyul,

876
00:59:28.415 --> 00:59:30.580
- Ms, Choi, - Yes,

877
00:59:31.251 --> 00:59:33.180
Bye, Do Yoon,

878
00:59:33.186 --> 00:59:34.820
Yes, bye,

879
00:59:39.125 --> 00:59:40.990
You're embarrassing me,

880
00:59:41.294 --> 00:59:44.160
I heard love hurts,

881
00:59:44.731 --> 00:59:46.130
Bye,

882
00:59:50.270 --> 00:59:53.100
Did you study hard, Han Gyul?

883
00:59:53.907 --> 00:59:56.770
I've made you snacks, Let's go,

884
00:59:56.776 --> 00:59:58.710
Ms, Choi,

885
00:59:58.712 --> 01:00:01.740
I want to go to my mom and dad,

886
01:00:01.748 --> 01:00:03.310
Can we?

887
01:00:09.189 --> 01:00:10.360
Jung Su Ji,

888
01:00:10.957 --> 01:00:13.490
Where's your sister?

889
01:00:15.929 --> 01:00:18.730
Tell me, Where is she?

890
01:00:21.101 --> 01:00:23.630
It seems you're mistaken that my sister is involved,

891
01:00:23.637 --> 01:00:25.440
but she isn't,

892
01:00:25.639 --> 01:00:27.100
She's still in prison,,,

893
01:00:27.107 --> 01:00:28.940
She got out a month ago,

894
01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:35.150
Did Jung Su Mi make you do this?

895
01:00:35.315 --> 01:00:37.680
She told you to threaten us using Han Gyul, didn't she?

896
01:00:37.684 --> 01:00:39.980
No, I did it alone,

897
01:00:39.986 --> 01:00:41.850
Kill me or save me, Do whatever you want,

898
01:00:43.623 --> 01:00:46.690
Didn't I hit you enough?

899
01:00:46.693 --> 01:00:49.560
Hey, If I call the police,

900
01:00:49.562 --> 01:00:52.790
you'll be sent to prison for blackmail,

901
01:00:52.799 --> 01:00:54.330
Do you want to do that?

902
01:00:56.169 --> 01:00:57.530
Suit yourself,

903
01:00:57.537 --> 01:01:00.440
My life is ruined already, I don't care,

904
01:01:00.507 --> 01:01:02.870
She keeps saying ruined life,,,

905
01:01:02.876 --> 01:01:05.270
when she's still so young,

906
01:01:05.278 --> 01:01:08.250
Mom, Please calm down,

907
01:01:08.915 --> 01:01:12.580
Excuse me, It will never settle if you keep refusing to confess,

908
01:01:12.819 --> 01:01:15.950
I don't know why you did this,

909
01:01:16.022 --> 01:01:18.420
but we're not as easy as you think,

910
01:01:20.226 --> 01:01:23.090
You abandoned such a little kid,

911
01:01:23.463 --> 01:01:26.900
and how dare you disrupt happiness she barely grabbed?

912
01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:30.170
Do you have any idea how much my family suffered because of you?

913
01:01:30.437 --> 01:01:32.000
It'll never be enough even if you go on your knees,

914
01:01:32.005 --> 01:01:33.870
but how dare you try to blackmail us for money?

915
01:01:34.307 --> 01:01:36.740
Using your poor niece as a hostage,

916
01:01:37.477 --> 01:01:39.380
Are you even human?

917
01:01:40.346 --> 01:01:43.820
So go ahead and put me in jail,

918
01:01:46.486 --> 01:01:47.850
What are you doing?

919
01:01:51.958 --> 01:01:53.360
Call your sister,

920
01:01:55.128 --> 01:01:58.460
You can't leave this place before your sister gets here,

921
01:01:58.998 --> 01:02:00.570
Call her now,

922
01:02:07.207 --> 01:02:08.670
I'm sorry,

923
01:02:10.043 --> 01:02:12.540
I'll never show up in front of Han Gyul,

924
01:02:13.146 --> 01:02:14.480
Please forgive me,

925
01:02:14.748 --> 01:02:15.980
My sister,,,

926
01:02:16.750 --> 01:02:19.920
She really doesn't know anything, It's true,

927
01:02:21.287 --> 01:02:22.350
Please,,,

928
01:02:23.123 --> 01:02:24.590
Please forgive me,

929
01:02:25.859 --> 01:02:27.490
So call your sister,

930
01:02:28.128 --> 01:02:30.900
Then we'll decide whether to forgive you or not,

931
01:02:31.998 --> 01:02:33.060
Now,

932
01:02:39.105 --> 01:02:40.270
Call her now,

933
01:02:55.989 --> 01:02:57.120
Yes?

934
01:02:58.291 --> 01:03:01.230
Hello? Go ahead, Hello?

935
01:03:04.998 --> 01:03:06.130
It's me,

936
01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.830
Han Gyul's mom,

937
01:03:11.638 --> 01:03:12.900
Jung Su Mi?

938
01:03:22.248 --> 01:03:24.480
You said you wanted me to call you regarding Han Gyul,

939
01:03:25.685 --> 01:03:27.020
What's going on?

940
01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:28.950
I'm with your sister right now,

941
01:03:29.756 --> 01:03:30.960
Su Ji?

942
01:03:31.457 --> 01:03:33.120
What has she done?

943
01:03:33.259 --> 01:03:35.130
Why would you ask me?

944
01:03:35.328 --> 01:03:36.900
You know better,

945
01:03:38.731 --> 01:03:40.730
What are you talking about?

946
01:03:40.767 --> 01:03:42.430
I don't want to talk to you,

947
01:03:42.836 --> 01:03:44.400
Come here now,

948
01:03:51.144 --> 01:03:52.610
How about this one?

949
01:03:52.679 --> 01:03:55.080
It's still cold, This will keep you warm,

950
01:03:55.081 --> 01:03:56.380
Should I?

951
01:03:57.116 --> 01:03:58.980
Han Gyul's here,

952
01:03:58.985 --> 01:04:01.490
- Han Gyul, - So Hee,

953
01:04:02.288 --> 01:04:03.690
How are you?

954
01:04:03.690 --> 01:04:07.290
Good, Where's Mom?

955
01:04:07.293 --> 01:04:09.290
She went to your dad's hospital,

956
01:04:09.295 --> 01:04:10.830
Do you want me to call her here?

957
01:04:10.830 --> 01:04:13.130
No, I'll go there,

958
01:04:14.267 --> 01:04:16.700
Be careful, Be careful,

959
01:04:18.938 --> 01:04:21.710
What's taking that shameless girl so long?

960
01:04:22.909 --> 01:04:24.510
She should be here soon,

961
01:04:32.752 --> 01:04:34.020
Yes, So Hee,

962
01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:37.860
Han Gyul just got here, She just left to the hospital,

963
01:04:39.292 --> 01:04:40.490
What?

964
01:04:41.227 --> 01:04:42.490
What's wrong?

965
01:04:42.528 --> 01:04:44.730
Han Gyul's coming to the hospital now,

966
01:04:57.076 --> 01:04:59.780
Hurry up, Ms, Choi,

967
01:05:01.481 --> 01:05:03.810
I'm heavier than you,

968
01:05:03.816 --> 01:05:06.680
Slow down, Han Gyul,

969
01:05:07.387 --> 01:05:09.950
You can do it, Ms, Choi,

970
01:05:09.956 --> 01:05:11.090
Han Gyul,

971
01:05:13.026 --> 01:05:15.130
- Han Gyul, - Mom,

972
01:05:56.469 --> 01:05:58.600
(Man Who Sets the Table)

973
01:05:58.838 --> 01:06:00.370
What's her relationship with Father?

974
01:06:00.373 --> 01:06:02.800
Why did she try to harm Father with Joo Ae Ri and Director Park?

975
01:06:02.809 --> 01:06:04.070
This is huge,

976
01:06:04.077 --> 01:06:05.470
I can't go because we've graduated from marriage,

977
01:06:05.478 --> 01:06:08.040
I can't act like we're close,

978
01:06:08.047 --> 01:06:10.680
I'm sure it was Susanna, How could this happen?

979
01:06:10.683 --> 01:06:12.480
I went to her grave,

980
01:06:12.485 --> 01:06:14.520
Long time no see, It's been three years,

981
01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:15.520
Mom?

982
01:06:15.521 --> 01:06:19.520
Excuse me, You were with Dad yesterday, right?

983
01:06:19.525 --> 01:06:21.560
No, You're mistaken,

984
01:06:21.561 --> 01:06:24.830
People who don't know how to be grateful should be ruined,

985
01:06:24.831 --> 01:06:27.060
I'll do that now,

986
01:06:27.066 --> 01:06:29.070
You don't need to be worried, Just wait,
