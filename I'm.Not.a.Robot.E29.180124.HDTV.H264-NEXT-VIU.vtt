00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:08.679
(Episode 29)

2
00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.919
- See here. - Okay.

3
00:00:17.629 --> 00:00:19.789
- Here. - Right.

4
00:00:24.013 --> 00:00:26.752
Ji A, there is no end in peeling these.

5
00:00:26.752 --> 00:00:29.282
I already took off the peels. What are you doing?

6
00:00:29.282 --> 00:00:31.752
- You should just cut them in half. - What?

7
00:00:31.752 --> 00:00:32.923
- Are you out of eggs? - Half?

8
00:00:33.063 --> 00:00:34.693
Look in the fridge beside you.

9
00:00:36.762 --> 00:00:38.563
- I'll do it. move. - I'll do it. I'll do it.

10
00:00:38.563 --> 00:00:40.163
- You should clean this up. - Hand that to me.

11
00:00:40.163 --> 00:00:42.163
Just leave me alone! It's confusing.

12
00:00:42.163 --> 00:00:43.932
Just leave it.

13
00:00:43.932 --> 00:00:47.072
- I can do it. - It's burning.

14
00:00:47.072 --> 00:00:48.773
- Please. - Move over.

15
00:00:49.042 --> 00:00:50.943
- Just let me do this myself. - Just move over.

16
00:00:50.943 --> 00:00:52.413
I can do this.

17
00:00:52.413 --> 00:00:53.582
Are you here?

18
00:00:59.853 --> 00:01:03.222
They all had something to say to you.

19
00:01:04.993 --> 00:01:06.163
Would that be all right?

20
00:01:06.223 --> 00:01:09.122
We will be moving out tomorrow.

21
00:01:09.122 --> 00:01:11.493
We won't be seeing each other again,

22
00:01:11.863 --> 00:01:15.033
so I suggested we eat together one last time.

23
00:01:18.172 --> 00:01:21.672
All of us cooked together today.

24
00:01:22.003 --> 00:01:24.572
Make sure to clean properly before you leave...

25
00:01:26.182 --> 00:01:29.012
since we will never see each other again.

26
00:01:29.682 --> 00:01:31.553
Right. Okay.

27
00:01:33.122 --> 00:01:35.482
We will clean up the place with bleach.

28
00:01:45.633 --> 00:01:48.363
We will be moving out tomorrow.

29
00:01:48.562 --> 00:01:50.473
We won't be seeing each other again,

30
00:01:50.732 --> 00:01:54.042
so I suggested we eat together one last time.

31
00:01:54.402 --> 00:01:56.243
It's so simple for him, isn't it?

32
00:01:57.773 --> 00:02:00.613
How can he say that so easily?

33
00:02:10.052 --> 00:02:12.322
Wow. I can eat it too now.

34
00:02:13.292 --> 00:02:14.292
Yes.

35
00:02:16.232 --> 00:02:18.992
- Try this. I brought it from home. - Okay.

36
00:02:26.272 --> 00:02:27.272
How is it?

37
00:02:28.542 --> 00:02:29.572
It's good.

38
00:02:30.373 --> 00:02:32.913
- Gosh, it must be really good. - Really?

39
00:02:42.623 --> 00:02:44.223
Ji A, when did you start cooking?

40
00:02:44.922 --> 00:02:46.623
A few days ago.

41
00:02:47.022 --> 00:02:48.223
I ate too much already.

42
00:02:48.623 --> 00:02:49.663
Is it bad?

43
00:02:50.693 --> 00:02:51.732
Well...

44
00:02:53.633 --> 00:02:55.702
- Are you sure it's good? - Yes.

45
00:02:57.433 --> 00:02:58.433
But,

46
00:02:59.903 --> 00:03:01.843
I'll do the cooking from now on.

47
00:03:03.443 --> 00:03:04.672
- Why? What's wrong? - Yes, you should.

48
00:03:07.742 --> 00:03:11.283
- It's good. You should try some. - I don't eat meat.

49
00:03:11.283 --> 00:03:12.313
Since when?

50
00:03:12.582 --> 00:03:14.482
- You're annoying. - Since when?

51
00:03:14.482 --> 00:03:15.522
Since when?

52
00:03:15.522 --> 00:03:16.593
It's best if Ji A doesn't cook.

53
00:03:16.593 --> 00:03:17.792
You're better at cooking.

54
00:03:18.522 --> 00:03:21.063
So are you feeling better?

55
00:03:21.792 --> 00:03:22.862
I'm getting better.

56
00:03:22.862 --> 00:03:25.463
Sitting here together likes this...

57
00:03:25.463 --> 00:03:27.463
reminds me of the first day he invited us over.

58
00:03:27.463 --> 00:03:30.172
I miss that. I miss it.

59
00:03:30.172 --> 00:03:32.403
When? I don't remember it.

60
00:03:32.403 --> 00:03:35.072
Kim Min Kyu invited people over for food?

61
00:03:37.072 --> 00:03:38.542
The thing is...

62
00:03:38.542 --> 00:03:41.042
When we told him we would take Aji 3 away,

63
00:03:41.383 --> 00:03:42.982
he was so scared.

64
00:03:42.982 --> 00:03:46.653
He prepared a feast and invited us to persuade us.

65
00:03:46.982 --> 00:03:50.322
Guess what Min Kyu called us then.

66
00:03:50.452 --> 00:03:51.653
Researcher one.

67
00:03:51.753 --> 00:03:53.063
- Two. - Three.

68
00:03:53.063 --> 00:03:56.063
Is it three strikes, and we're out?

69
00:03:56.563 --> 00:03:58.292
It's a tremendous improvement.

70
00:03:58.762 --> 00:04:01.503
It's all thanks to me, isn't it?

71
00:04:01.903 --> 00:04:05.403
- His food was really good. - It was delicious indeed.

72
00:04:05.403 --> 00:04:07.943
What was the point? You ignored me.

73
00:04:10.772 --> 00:04:13.283
Beetle. It's a gift for you.

74
00:04:16.682 --> 00:04:17.713
Why?

75
00:04:18.913 --> 00:04:20.323
Well,

76
00:04:21.122 --> 00:04:23.023
we don't know when we'll see each other again.

77
00:04:24.192 --> 00:04:25.752
We might never see each other again..

78
00:04:26.362 --> 00:04:27.922
We thought about it,

79
00:04:27.922 --> 00:04:30.132
and we only received things from you.

80
00:04:30.132 --> 00:04:32.432
We never gave you anything before.

81
00:04:32.903 --> 00:04:34.163
But...

82
00:04:34.732 --> 00:04:37.302
you're rich and have everything you need.

83
00:04:37.302 --> 00:04:39.403
We thought Beetle would be...

84
00:04:39.872 --> 00:04:42.143
the best present we could give you.

85
00:04:42.242 --> 00:04:44.513
Beetle can make friends with Pretty.

86
00:04:47.682 --> 00:04:49.653
We upgraded it last night.

87
00:04:50.283 --> 00:04:53.953
The batteries will last longer, and it has more expressions now.

88
00:04:54.323 --> 00:04:55.982
It won't be as good as Aji 3,

89
00:04:56.552 --> 00:04:58.653
but it'll be able to keep you company when you're bored.

90
00:05:00.422 --> 00:05:01.463
Min Kyu.

91
00:05:03.533 --> 00:05:04.562
I'm really sorry.

92
00:05:10.073 --> 00:05:11.103
When we leave,

93
00:05:13.273 --> 00:05:14.703
I hope you forget all bad memories...

94
00:05:15.242 --> 00:05:17.343
and remember only the good memories.

95
00:05:19.882 --> 00:05:21.783
Of you can just forget about everything if you want.

96
00:05:35.992 --> 00:05:37.033
No.

97
00:05:39.362 --> 00:05:40.502
What do you mean?

98
00:05:42.833 --> 00:05:44.002
Don't you like our gift?

99
00:05:44.103 --> 00:05:46.042
What am I supposed to do if that breaks?

100
00:05:46.042 --> 00:05:48.372
Do you expect me to fix it by myself? I don't know how to.

101
00:05:48.773 --> 00:05:50.713
Or do you want me to just throw it away at a junk shop?

102
00:05:52.112 --> 00:05:54.482
"A junk shop"?

103
00:05:56.752 --> 00:05:57.783
Doctor Hong.

104
00:05:59.013 --> 00:06:00.752
I think we're done eating.

105
00:06:01.353 --> 00:06:02.893
We should go now.

106
00:06:05.492 --> 00:06:06.492
Just stay.

107
00:06:08.963 --> 00:06:10.163
What?

108
00:06:11.463 --> 00:06:13.763
Just stay here.

109
00:06:19.132 --> 00:06:21.773
Why are you trying to go outside when it's this cold?

110
00:06:22.343 --> 00:06:24.343
Just stay here at my house.

111
00:06:28.682 --> 00:06:31.882
You're right. I heard it's really cold today.

112
00:06:34.052 --> 00:06:36.692
Ji A, can you give me some more rice then?

113
00:06:36.692 --> 00:06:40.323
Min Kyu, should we drink some beer then?

114
00:06:41.192 --> 00:06:44.393
I still have that huge chicken we last had together.

115
00:06:44.393 --> 00:06:46.763
- You still have that? - You do?

116
00:06:47.002 --> 00:06:48.502
Do you own a chicken farm?

117
00:06:48.502 --> 00:06:51.833
- Then we should eat that. - Do you sell chicken?

118
00:06:52.132 --> 00:06:53.143
You must raise a lot of chickens.

119
00:07:14.792 --> 00:07:17.533
Yes. You'll be a military robot.

120
00:07:18.393 --> 00:07:20.432
The world's most dangerous weapon.

121
00:07:21.163 --> 00:07:24.002
Am I not supposed to live with humans?

122
00:07:25.432 --> 00:07:28.302
You're just a product owned by a man.

123
00:07:29.812 --> 00:07:31.013
This man.

124
00:07:33.812 --> 00:07:36.083
You do not exist as a living creature.

125
00:07:42.083 --> 00:07:43.122
Hi, Aji 3.

126
00:07:43.752 --> 00:07:45.492
Currently operating Master Mode.

127
00:07:47.362 --> 00:07:48.362
Friend Mode.

128
00:07:49.192 --> 00:07:51.632
- Did you call me? - Hey, it works.

129
00:07:52.232 --> 00:07:54.932
Aji 3, we're friends now.

130
00:07:54.932 --> 00:07:57.172
No, we're a family.

131
00:07:57.273 --> 00:07:59.132
Aji 3, remember this.

132
00:07:59.442 --> 00:08:03.542
You'll be living with humans as their friend and family.

133
00:08:03.643 --> 00:08:05.413
Is that what I am?

134
00:08:05.513 --> 00:08:09.013
Yes. I hope we get along well.

135
00:08:53.593 --> 00:08:56.362
I'm sorry, Aji 3.

136
00:08:57.793 --> 00:09:00.303
I'm sorry, Aji 3.

137
00:10:34.522 --> 00:10:35.622
You can keep sleeping.

138
00:10:38.762 --> 00:10:39.902
Why?

139
00:10:46.002 --> 00:10:47.103
I like it...

140
00:10:48.772 --> 00:10:50.973
when you look at me.

141
00:10:54.443 --> 00:10:55.612
But...

142
00:10:57.652 --> 00:10:59.652
you look sad right now.

143
00:11:01.622 --> 00:11:02.752
You're wrong.

144
00:11:03.492 --> 00:11:05.392
I'm happy right now.

145
00:11:07.423 --> 00:11:08.823
Min Kyu.

146
00:11:11.362 --> 00:11:16.232
Remember how I look and feel right now.

147
00:11:18.173 --> 00:11:20.303
It upsets me when you lie to me.

148
00:11:28.882 --> 00:11:29.982
You're right.

149
00:11:31.553 --> 00:11:32.652
I'm sad.

150
00:11:35.083 --> 00:11:36.593
I found you.

151
00:11:39.793 --> 00:11:41.223
But the Santa Maria Research Team...

152
00:11:42.693 --> 00:11:43.992
lost Aji 3.

153
00:11:46.662 --> 00:11:47.963
That's why I'm sad.

154
00:12:07.823 --> 00:12:09.923
I don't know about anyone else,

155
00:12:10.652 --> 00:12:11.923
but I know very well...

156
00:12:14.892 --> 00:12:16.193
that you tried...

157
00:12:17.362 --> 00:12:20.262
everything you could today...

158
00:12:21.002 --> 00:12:22.772
to protect Aji 3.

159
00:12:30.912 --> 00:12:33.242
Will you remember this?

160
00:12:36.053 --> 00:12:38.313
Wherever you may be,

161
00:12:40.323 --> 00:12:42.553
I'll always be by your side.

162
00:12:57.933 --> 00:12:59.402
You did well.

163
00:13:31.372 --> 00:13:32.872
I'm sorry.

164
00:13:33.742 --> 00:13:34.902
You can cry.

165
00:13:35.843 --> 00:13:38.073
I'm sure you're more upset than I am.

166
00:13:38.742 --> 00:13:40.343
That's not true.

167
00:13:42.043 --> 00:13:43.583
I know you're sadder about this.

168
00:14:17.213 --> 00:14:19.522
We still have time until the final contract.

169
00:14:20.122 --> 00:14:22.353
So I should try to come up with a way until the very end, right?

170
00:14:24.323 --> 00:14:26.262
That's more like you.

171
00:14:31.032 --> 00:14:32.662
Let's see.

175
00:14:46.142 --> 00:14:47.142
I...

176
00:14:48.213 --> 00:14:49.213
I...

177
00:14:49.512 --> 00:14:51.912
I think I found a way to bring Aji 3 back.

178
00:15:01.662 --> 00:15:04.662
What? Is it that fascinating to see me drive too?

179
00:15:05.333 --> 00:15:07.433
Yes, it's fascinating.

180
00:15:10.502 --> 00:15:12.303
Why didn't he use his blinkers?

181
00:15:21.242 --> 00:15:22.242
Did you get butterflies?

182
00:15:26.522 --> 00:15:29.453
Hey. Don't distract me while I'm driving.

- Go on. - I'll be back soon.

185
00:16:10.293 --> 00:16:11.333
Welcome.

186
00:16:33.953 --> 00:16:35.382
Hello, Mr. Kim.

187
00:16:38.093 --> 00:16:39.093
Madam...

188
00:16:40.522 --> 00:16:43.963
- X? - Madam X told me to meet you here.

189
00:16:45.162 --> 00:16:48.963
Martin is a criminal on Interpol's blacklist.

190
00:16:49.803 --> 00:16:53.043
Murder, fraud, instigating arson.

191
00:16:53.372 --> 00:16:55.242
He committed many crimes,

192
00:16:55.502 --> 00:16:58.872
but he wasn't held accountable due to lack of evidence.

193
00:16:59.213 --> 00:17:02.612
If Jang Doo Sam's recording has something on Martin,

194
00:17:02.882 --> 00:17:04.452
we can contact Interpol...

195
00:17:04.912 --> 00:17:07.722
and have them put him in the witness protection program.

196
00:17:14.962 --> 00:17:17.263
We'll have just one look, okay?

197
00:17:18.033 --> 00:17:19.192
Thanks, Uncle.

198
00:17:19.763 --> 00:17:22.702
I won't leave until I see her. I'll wait.

199
00:17:23.202 --> 00:17:24.202
Right here.

200
00:17:24.833 --> 00:17:26.003
I will see her.

201
00:17:26.003 --> 00:17:28.273
Okay, how many times do I have to tell you?

202
00:17:28.273 --> 00:17:31.043
I said you can see her.

203
00:17:31.043 --> 00:17:32.543
Why would you keep saying that?

204
00:17:34.813 --> 00:17:35.813
I'll wait.

205
00:17:40.083 --> 00:17:44.293
I think Jang Doo Sam disappeared the day I met him with Doctor Hong.

206
00:17:44.392 --> 00:17:45.692
I sent a text,

207
00:17:47.422 --> 00:17:48.692
but I'm not sure if he'll come.

208
00:17:48.793 --> 00:17:49.833
Was it 2pm?

209
00:17:50.892 --> 00:17:52.093
We don't have much time.

210
00:18:04.712 --> 00:18:05.743
Anyway,

211
00:18:07.142 --> 00:18:08.412
when did my sister...

212
00:18:09.583 --> 00:18:11.783
become your driver?

213
00:18:15.222 --> 00:18:20.263
Oh, that's... I'm sorry.

214
00:18:32.672 --> 00:18:33.743
Jang Doo Sam.

215
00:18:36.142 --> 00:18:37.172
Have a seat.

216
00:18:41.283 --> 00:18:43.152
How will you protect me?

217
00:18:43.912 --> 00:18:47.553
You'll be protected by Interpol's witness protection program.

218
00:18:49.253 --> 00:18:52.652
Here's the information on where you can stay...

219
00:18:52.922 --> 00:18:54.362
and what to do.

220
00:18:56.833 --> 00:18:57.962
I know...

221
00:18:58.793 --> 00:19:01.702
what you did to stay alive.

222
00:19:02.333 --> 00:19:03.773
You can't trust anyone.

223
00:19:04.333 --> 00:19:07.872
You can't be sure if you're with someone who'll help or not.

224
00:19:08.442 --> 00:19:09.972
You don't want to live like that,

225
00:19:11.142 --> 00:19:12.412
but you know of no other way.

226
00:19:13.543 --> 00:19:17.152
I know very well what that is like.

227
00:19:18.283 --> 00:19:21.182
Jang Doo Sam. Take my hand.

228
00:19:21.523 --> 00:19:22.583
I will...

229
00:19:23.523 --> 00:19:25.523
offer you that way.

230
00:19:37.333 --> 00:19:39.672
This is the recording I told you about.

231
00:19:39.672 --> 00:19:41.303
Can you do it before 2pm?

232
00:19:42.043 --> 00:19:43.412
Please do.

233
00:19:51.382 --> 00:19:52.382
How did it go?

234
00:19:54.553 --> 00:19:55.622
You did it?

235
00:20:03.192 --> 00:20:07.103
Now, the problem is getting there before the signing ceremony. Well...

236
00:20:10.503 --> 00:20:13.743
Yes, I'll call you as soon as I find Aji 3 after I get there.

237
00:20:14.003 --> 00:20:15.043
Okay.

238
00:20:16.273 --> 00:20:18.513
Don't worry, I'll get you there.

239
00:20:21.083 --> 00:20:22.412
Gosh, this is...

(Sale of Daeyang Shipbuilding's RnD Team)

241
00:20:29.793 --> 00:20:33.162
We shall now begin the ceremony for selling Daeyang Shipbuilding's...

242
00:20:33.162 --> 00:20:34.692
RnD Team.

243
00:20:35.793 --> 00:20:38.293
- Congratulations. - And to you. Shall we?

244
00:20:38.293 --> 00:20:39.293
Sure.

245
00:20:44.432 --> 00:20:45.603
President Martin?

246
00:20:47.202 --> 00:20:49.442
I'm afraid we cannot proceed...

247
00:20:49.442 --> 00:20:51.813
with the transaction of Team Santa Maria today.

248
00:20:52.273 --> 00:20:56.682
Also, we are going to cancel all of our contracts...

249
00:20:56.813 --> 00:20:58.253
with Bold Corporation.

250
00:21:02.122 --> 00:21:03.122
Kim Min Kyu.

251
00:21:03.823 --> 00:21:06.793
It's all over. What do you think you're doing?

252
00:21:11.632 --> 00:21:13.033
We're here, sir.

253
00:21:14.932 --> 00:21:15.962
You're right.

254
00:21:17.073 --> 00:21:18.303
It's all over.

255
00:21:19.503 --> 00:21:20.543
For you.

(Sale of Daeyang Shipbuilding's RnD Team)

257

Hwang Do Won.

258
00:21:27.182 --> 00:21:30.583
You're arrested for the murder of Daeyang's chairman, Park Sung Jin.

259
00:21:30.952 --> 00:21:33.682
- What's going on? - Murder?

260
00:21:33.682 --> 00:21:36.323
You must come with us to give a statement.

261
00:21:37.192 --> 00:21:39.152
No. We refuse to go anywhere.

262
00:21:40.892 --> 00:21:41.962
Mr. Martin.

263
00:21:56.003 --> 00:21:57.013
Let's go.

264
00:22:06.323 --> 00:22:07.922
Things will get worse.

265
00:22:09.353 --> 00:22:10.422
No.

266
00:22:11.793 --> 00:22:13.023
This is it.

267
00:22:57.533 --> 00:23:00.603
What the heck?

268
00:23:07.743 --> 00:23:09.983
- What? - Martin came for her,

269
00:23:10.182 --> 00:23:11.813
but Aji 3's gone.

270
00:23:12.283 --> 00:23:14.253
Where did Aji 3 go?

271
00:23:24.763 --> 00:23:25.763
Hi.

272
00:23:28.033 --> 00:23:31.033
Aji 3 disappeared?

273
00:23:50.993 --> 00:23:53.162
Let's go home.

274
00:23:56.333 --> 00:23:58.132
(GPS removed)

275
00:23:58.692 --> 00:24:00.862
(No network connection)

276
00:24:02.003 --> 00:24:05.103
Shoot! Damn it!

277
00:24:09.142 --> 00:24:10.972
The police have gotten involved.

278
00:24:11.273 --> 00:24:13.783
We need to leave the country immediately.

279
00:24:14.043 --> 00:24:18.053
Those things that we discussed in front of the Aji 3 last night.

280
00:24:18.612 --> 00:24:22.422
You have no idea what I had to go through to get the Aji 3 here.

281
00:24:22.753 --> 00:24:25.323
I killed that old fool, Park, myself.

282
00:24:29.563 --> 00:24:32.563
We're going to have to delete all of Aji 3's data.

283
00:24:32.862 --> 00:24:36.632
Make sure it's completely wiped. Are we clear on this?

284
00:24:36.872 --> 00:24:40.672
If anything goes wrong, you'll be the one taking the fall.

285
00:24:44.712 --> 00:24:46.142
Look at her.

286
00:24:49.712 --> 00:24:52.382
She must feel so cold.

287
00:24:53.053 --> 00:24:55.122
What's she wearing? It's so thin.

288
00:25:00.063 --> 00:25:01.862
I was crossing the road yesterday,

289
00:25:02.662 --> 00:25:03.662
and everyone...

290
00:25:04.632 --> 00:25:06.202
looked like trees to me.

291
00:25:07.763 --> 00:25:11.573
It was as if I was walking through a forest.

292
00:25:13.442 --> 00:25:16.003
Some of the trees looked interesting,

293
00:25:17.013 --> 00:25:20.243
and I wanted to touch some of them.

294
00:25:39.362 --> 00:25:43.672
Hey, Aji 3 went outside on her own.

295
00:25:43.803 --> 00:25:45.333
What is happening?

296
00:25:48.972 --> 00:25:51.672
What? Aji 3 walked out on her own?

297
00:25:52.243 --> 00:25:53.882
She couldn't have gone far.

298
00:25:54.013 --> 00:25:56.412
Ji A and Min Kyu are looking around the area.

299
00:26:44.432 --> 00:26:46.563
It's too cramped. Go away.

300
00:26:47.603 --> 00:26:50.932
This bench is made for three people. It is not cramped.

301
00:26:51.632 --> 00:26:53.773
It's too cramped for me.

302
00:26:59.142 --> 00:27:00.442
Aren't you scared of me?

303
00:27:00.783 --> 00:27:04.382
No matter how you look, you are all humans to me.

304
00:27:05.753 --> 00:27:07.483
"All humans"?

305
00:27:08.483 --> 00:27:09.523
Here.

306
00:27:10.952 --> 00:27:12.192
Hold my hand.

307
00:27:15.023 --> 00:27:17.063
You have a beautiful hand.

308
00:27:17.862 --> 00:27:18.962
What?

309
00:27:25.902 --> 00:27:27.103
Aren't you cold?

310
00:27:28.773 --> 00:27:30.712
Where are you going dressed like that?

311
00:27:30.813 --> 00:27:32.243
Home.

312
00:27:32.243 --> 00:27:33.843
Where is your home?

313
00:27:33.983 --> 00:27:36.353
Where my friends and family are.

314
00:27:36.353 --> 00:27:37.853
Where is that?

315
00:27:37.853 --> 00:27:40.083
It's a place I can recharge myself.

316
00:27:44.823 --> 00:27:46.793
Then don't wander around and go straight home.

317
00:27:47.493 --> 00:27:48.862
Or you will end up like me.

318
00:27:52.392 --> 00:27:55.132
What does it mean to end up like you?

319
00:27:56.233 --> 00:27:58.333
I have no one to see.

320
00:28:01.472 --> 00:28:03.513
There is no one waiting for me.

321
00:28:05.472 --> 00:28:07.642
No one is interested in me either.

322
00:28:08.882 --> 00:28:10.783
I am interested in you.

323
00:28:11.182 --> 00:28:13.722
What kind of person are you?

324
00:28:30.733 --> 00:28:33.402
Here. Take this to pay for the bus.

325
00:28:34.142 --> 00:28:35.543
You know how to take the bus, right?

326
00:28:36.472 --> 00:28:39.382
Get going. Your family must be worried.

327
00:28:47.922 --> 00:28:49.593
Hurry up, and go.

328
00:28:49.793 --> 00:28:52.053
You're disturbing me.

329
00:28:57.563 --> 00:29:00.432
Chairman Hwang, are you going to keep being like this?

330
00:29:07.003 --> 00:29:09.243
(DVR, REC010.M)

331
00:29:09.243 --> 00:29:12.273
Chairman Hwang, are you behind what happened to Chairman Park?

332
00:29:12.882 --> 00:29:16.053
Remember this. You don't know anything.

333
00:29:16.053 --> 00:29:19.722
That's the only way for you and your family to stay alive.

334
00:29:21.023 --> 00:29:22.823
Will you still keep your silence?

335
00:29:24.853 --> 00:29:27.722
Let's talk when my attorney gets here.

336
00:29:30.833 --> 00:29:32.293
I'm leaving tonight.

337
00:29:32.563 --> 00:29:34.662
Do everything you can to get the Aji 3 back.

338
00:29:34.662 --> 00:29:36.702
If you can't make it happen, destroy it.

339
00:29:36.902 --> 00:29:39.202
I don't want anyone else getting their hands on it.

340
00:29:40.003 --> 00:29:44.472
Listen. I know that Hwang acquired those shares illegally.

341
00:29:45.412 --> 00:29:47.612
I was the one who gave him the money to do it.

342
00:29:47.912 --> 00:29:52.382
Which means, if you don't do what I tell you to do,

343
00:29:52.382 --> 00:29:54.853
your father will be the one to get hurt.

344
00:29:56.652 --> 00:29:59.053
We're all in this together, you know?

345
00:30:04.033 --> 00:30:05.733
Is it true what the detectives said?

346
00:30:07.533 --> 00:30:09.702
Did father...

347
00:30:11.073 --> 00:30:12.503
really murder Chairman Park?

348
00:30:13.343 --> 00:30:14.503
That's not true.

349
00:30:15.642 --> 00:30:16.942
Then who was it?

350
00:30:19.013 --> 00:30:20.412
Mr. Yoon.

351
00:30:21.843 --> 00:30:23.412
It was President Martin.

352
00:30:23.813 --> 00:30:25.313
However, there is no evidence.

353
00:30:25.313 --> 00:30:28.682
Your father looked over his crime,

354
00:30:29.182 --> 00:30:30.922
in return for the rebate.

355
00:30:31.622 --> 00:30:34.023
That's what Martin meant when he said...

356
00:30:34.523 --> 00:30:35.593
that we're in it together.

357
00:30:35.593 --> 00:30:37.093
Father...

358
00:30:38.033 --> 00:30:40.233
looked over the crime?

359
00:30:40.233 --> 00:30:43.132
It would be best...

360
00:30:43.132 --> 00:30:46.603
to have Martin leave the country and get the chairman an acquittal.

361
00:30:46.603 --> 00:30:50.442
In order to do this, we have to make Director Ye come to our side.

362
00:30:50.642 --> 00:30:54.142
That is the only way to get rid of Director Kim Min Kyu.

363
00:30:58.513 --> 00:31:00.853
Both Martin and Chairman Hwang will be after her.

364
00:31:00.853 --> 00:31:02.993
We must find her before them no matter what.

365
00:31:04.323 --> 00:31:07.222
Why am I suddenly getting the feeling...

366
00:31:08.122 --> 00:31:10.763
that Aji 3 will go home?

367
00:31:11.293 --> 00:31:14.103
If I were her, I would think of home first.

368
00:31:41.162 --> 00:31:43.993
(Home of KM Financial's Director Kim Min Kyu)

(Directions: Bus 310)

370
00:31:57.912 --> 00:32:01.543
Excuse me, have you seen a woman in a pink dress?

371
00:32:07.682 --> 00:32:10.293
(KM Financial)

372
00:32:39.483 --> 00:32:41.523
I found out where Aji 3 is headed.

373
00:32:41.823 --> 00:32:43.323
She is heading to Director Kim Min Kyu's mansion.

374
00:32:44.753 --> 00:32:47.362
Don't lose her. Get her no matter what.

375
00:32:49.892 --> 00:32:51.362
It doesn't matter even if she breaks.

376
00:33:24.263 --> 00:33:25.662
You tried really hard.

377
00:33:31.132 --> 00:33:32.273
Let's sit over there.

378
00:33:32.432 --> 00:33:35.472
Sit right here. I'll be just behind you.

379
00:33:56.063 --> 00:33:57.833
Thank you.

380
00:34:03.632 --> 00:34:04.972
You're pretty.

381
00:34:11.342 --> 00:34:14.912
Bus number 7700 will be arriving soon.

382
00:34:16.853 --> 00:34:18.753
She just got on a bus.

383
00:34:23.193 --> 00:34:24.193
Dr. Hong.

384
00:34:24.552 --> 00:34:26.622
Aji 3 just got on a bus.

(Santa Maria Research Team)

386
00:34:52.883 --> 00:34:54.822
Are we leaving without seeing her then?

387
00:34:54.822 --> 00:34:57.653
- We waited long enough. - Okay.

388
00:34:58.253 --> 00:35:01.423
Hey, you need to focus. Drive properly!

389
00:35:04.363 --> 00:35:06.463
There...

390
00:35:06.463 --> 00:35:09.032
It... It's Aji 3!

391
00:35:09.133 --> 00:35:11.673
Hey, it's your lucky day.

392
00:35:19.443 --> 00:35:20.443
Aji 3.

393
00:35:25.313 --> 00:35:27.153
Aji 3, where are you going?

394
00:35:29.052 --> 00:35:30.153
Home.

395
00:35:31.253 --> 00:35:33.293
I'll give you a ride. Get in.

396
00:35:33.492 --> 00:35:35.662
Get in. Get in.

397
00:35:37.833 --> 00:35:38.833
Get in.

398
00:35:50.273 --> 00:35:51.273
Okay.

399
00:35:58.113 --> 00:35:59.113
What is this?

400
00:36:08.592 --> 00:36:09.633
Get them.

401
00:36:11.733 --> 00:36:12.863
- Open up. - Open it.

402
00:36:12.863 --> 00:36:14.233
- Hey. - Open the door.

403
00:36:14.233 --> 00:36:16.302
- Are these people scary? - Hey!

404
00:36:16.302 --> 00:36:17.702
- Yes. - Get out!

405
00:36:17.702 --> 00:36:19.372
- They're scary. - Hold tight!

406
00:36:20.043 --> 00:36:22.813
Aji 3, we'll protect you.
