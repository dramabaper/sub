1
00:00:06.783 --> 00:00:08.584
(The three friends go to Hokkaido as a part of Gu Ra Tour.)

2
00:00:09.184 --> 00:00:11.723
(However, they start fighting as soon as they arrive.)

3
00:00:12.094 --> 00:00:13.453
(Nothing has changed.)

4
00:00:14.024 --> 00:00:15.664
(The first thing to do on their list is to have a mutton barbecue.)

5
00:00:16.423 --> 00:00:17.633
(This is delicious.)

6
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:19.993
(After they eat,)

7
00:00:19.993 --> 00:00:21.664
(they fight again.)

8
00:00:21.903 --> 00:00:23.034
What did you say?

9
00:00:23.673 --> 00:00:24.934
(The next thing on their list is...)

10
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:27.173
(to taste the famous Sapporo ice cream.)

11
00:00:28.043 --> 00:00:30.173
(Please give me ice cream. I can't wait any longer.)

12
00:00:31.313 --> 00:00:33.743
(The city of snow is turning into a dark night.)

13
00:00:34.844 --> 00:00:38.054
(The days in this city are as busy as any other city.)

14
00:00:39.683 --> 00:00:42.453
(This charming city has its unique quietness.)

15
00:00:43.224 --> 00:00:45.923
(The night gets deeper as the three friends enjoy Sapporo.)

16
00:00:46.054 --> 00:00:49.524
(They're on their way to the famous ice cream shop.)

17
00:00:49.524 --> 00:00:51.094
- Here is the ice cream place. - Oh, okay.

18
00:00:51.094 --> 00:00:52.563
- I love ice cream. - You know this place?

19
00:00:52.563 --> 00:00:54.234
- This place is nice. - How many times have you been here?

20
00:00:54.234 --> 00:00:56.103
- No, not this way. - The entrance is here.

21
00:00:56.103 --> 00:00:57.874
It's my first time here. This place is nice.

22
00:00:57.874 --> 00:01:00.804
I love having something cold during the winter.

23
00:01:01.143 --> 00:01:02.544
Yes, ice cream.

24
00:01:02.673 --> 00:01:03.914
The ice cream is here.

25
00:01:03.914 --> 00:01:05.174
- Hello. - There's green tea flavor.

26
00:01:05.174 --> 00:01:06.343
- There's green tea. - Yes, there is.

27
00:01:06.343 --> 00:01:08.584
(This place not only has the ice cream that Gu Ra recommended,)

28
00:01:09.383 --> 00:01:11.683
(but it also has eye catching desserts that are...)

29
00:01:11.683 --> 00:01:13.724
(famous in Japan.)

30
00:01:14.954 --> 00:01:16.454
(Welcome.)

31
00:01:16.954 --> 00:01:18.394
- Have the green tea. - I'll have something else.

32
00:01:18.394 --> 00:01:20.463
- I'll taste this one first. - Try the original one.

33
00:01:20.593 --> 00:01:22.224
- Shall we order three? - Yes.

34
00:01:22.623 --> 00:01:24.733
A cone costs like three dollars, right?

35
00:01:24.933 --> 00:01:26.034
- Yes. - Yes.

36
00:01:26.164 --> 00:01:27.364
Please give me the receipt.

37
00:01:27.633 --> 00:01:29.763
Thank you. You should always save your receipts.

38
00:01:29.763 --> 00:01:30.873
You're right.

39
00:01:30.974 --> 00:01:33.474
(Meanwhile, the ice cream gets prepared.)

40
00:01:34.444 --> 00:01:36.903
- This looks so good. - It looks delicious.

41
00:01:36.903 --> 00:01:38.414
Thank you very much.

42
00:01:39.343 --> 00:01:40.683
Thank you. Doesn't it taste good?

43
00:01:40.683 --> 00:01:42.383
(Hyeon Gyeong and Sang Ryeol eat it right away.)

44
00:01:43.084 --> 00:01:44.683
- This is good. - I told you it tastes good.

45
00:01:44.683 --> 00:01:45.983
- I like this one. - I told you.

46
00:01:45.983 --> 00:01:47.584
- It tastes old-fashioned. - Yes.

47
00:01:47.584 --> 00:01:48.983
- Yes, it does. - It tastes old-fashioned.

48
00:01:49.353 --> 00:01:50.554
(Let' me have a bite too.)

49
00:01:51.724 --> 00:01:54.323
I like it, but my teeth are freezing.

50
00:01:54.593 --> 00:01:55.623
That's why we're having it.

51
00:01:55.623 --> 00:01:57.733
- Kids can have this. - It hurts my teeth.

52
00:01:57.733 --> 00:01:59.664
We should use a spoon. You should use a spoon too.

53
00:01:59.664 --> 00:02:00.933
This tastes so good.

54
00:02:00.933 --> 00:02:02.704
I can also taste my blood.

55
00:02:02.704 --> 00:02:03.704
(I can also taste my blood.)

56
00:02:03.834 --> 00:02:04.933
Come on.

57
00:02:05.073 --> 00:02:06.903
- I don't want to hang out with you. - I can't help it.

58
00:02:07.004 --> 00:02:08.704
- What do you mean you can't? - Are you two fine?

59
00:02:09.204 --> 00:02:10.843
(Ms. Oh, don't be so mean.)

60
00:02:11.473 --> 00:02:12.943
I think this looks good.

61
00:02:12.943 --> 00:02:14.243
- This one. This one. - Right?

62
00:02:14.243 --> 00:02:15.813
Why don't we all choose one?

63
00:02:15.813 --> 00:02:17.054
Choose one piece you want to have here.

64
00:02:17.054 --> 00:02:18.183
Shall we have a mont blanc?

65
00:02:18.183 --> 00:02:20.183
- I want the one at the very last. - You want the choux cream?

66
00:02:20.884 --> 00:02:22.123
Ms. Oh, sit at the center.

67
00:02:22.123 --> 00:02:23.623
- The place looks cute. - I know.

68
00:02:23.894 --> 00:02:25.394
The ice cream isn't too sweet. It tastes great.

69
00:02:25.394 --> 00:02:27.294
I love this ice cream very much.

70
00:02:27.294 --> 00:02:29.264
(The three friends finish their ice cream first.)

71
00:02:30.223 --> 00:02:34.734
(Making noise)

72
00:02:34.734 --> 00:02:36.634
Do you usually make so much noises when you eat?

73
00:02:36.864 --> 00:02:38.234
- Yes. - Really?

74
00:02:38.403 --> 00:02:41.443
Are you trying to control the sounds I make too?

75
00:02:41.574 --> 00:02:43.174
Why are you laughing, Ms. Oh?

76
00:02:43.174 --> 00:02:45.644
You're so cute. You always get mad.

77
00:02:45.644 --> 00:02:47.913
- Don't be extreme when you're old. - He's so naive.

78
00:02:48.514 --> 00:02:50.243
(After the ice cream, he begins to eat the cake.)

79
00:02:51.454 --> 00:02:53.153
This tastes very nice.

80
00:02:53.153 --> 00:02:55.884
- Try this one. - I'll try mine first.

81
00:02:57.554 --> 00:02:59.554
Women will love this dessert.

82
00:02:59.753 --> 00:03:00.864
It tastes so good.

83
00:03:00.864 --> 00:03:01.894
(The woman next to him is trying it right away.)

84
00:03:02.824 --> 00:03:03.894
(He's right.)

85
00:03:03.894 --> 00:03:05.764
That one also tastes so good.

86
00:03:05.764 --> 00:03:07.604
I love these two very much.

87
00:03:07.604 --> 00:03:09.403
I get happy as I eat.

88
00:03:10.304 --> 00:03:12.003
- It's delicious, isn't it? - We're having a lot.

89
00:03:12.234 --> 00:03:13.234
- Sang Ryeol. - What?

90
00:03:13.234 --> 00:03:15.604
Doesn't this remind you of old times?

91
00:03:15.873 --> 00:03:17.074
DJ.

92
00:03:17.514 --> 00:03:18.644
Turntables.

93
00:03:18.743 --> 00:03:20.144
Oh, that.

94
00:03:20.644 --> 00:03:22.644
- This thing. - Yes.

95
00:03:23.213 --> 00:03:26.954
(Sang Ryeol showed off his fantastic DJ-ing skills in Songdo.)

96
00:03:27.783 --> 00:03:29.123
(You got beat up by a gangster.)

97
00:03:29.783 --> 00:03:31.324
(He revealed his incredible past.)

98
00:03:32.153 --> 00:03:34.223
(Our DJ Sang Ryeol)

99
00:03:34.223 --> 00:03:35.993
- This is exactly like that thing. - Yes.

100
00:03:35.993 --> 00:03:37.634
- This. This. This. - Yes.

101
00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:38.933
This one.

102
00:03:40.604 --> 00:03:43.033
Shouldn't you say some things?

103
00:03:43.033 --> 00:03:44.933
Are you my trainer?

104
00:03:45.104 --> 00:03:47.804
- He's trying to help you. - Yes, I gave him the source.

105
00:03:47.804 --> 00:03:49.544
He gave you the tips for you to be funny here.

106
00:03:49.774 --> 00:03:52.313
Okay. I'll do it.

107
00:03:52.713 --> 00:03:54.443
Okay. I'll do it.

108
00:03:54.813 --> 00:03:57.084
Oh, thank you so much ladies and gentlemen.

109
00:03:57.084 --> 00:04:00.054
Welcome to Sapporo. Come on! Yes. Yes.

110
00:04:00.253 --> 00:04:01.283
(Very satisfied)

111
00:04:02.283 --> 00:04:03.993
Everybody dance now

112
00:04:04.894 --> 00:04:06.493
(The atmosphere goes up as his mature DJ-ing starts.)

113
00:04:06.493 --> 00:04:08.924
- Sounds like a club. - Get me stone, Doctor Base

114
00:04:09.123 --> 00:04:10.693
(We can't record what he is singing.)

115
00:04:10.933 --> 00:04:11.933
(On the microphone)

116
00:04:12.533 --> 00:04:13.533
(Jump)

117
00:04:13.593 --> 00:04:15.104
Let's party.

118
00:04:15.104 --> 00:04:16.564
(Let's party.)

119
00:04:17.934 --> 00:04:20.603
- I loved it. - Yes, it was good.

120
00:04:20.843 --> 00:04:21.874
It was very good.

121
00:04:22.004 --> 00:04:24.574
- I loved it. - Yes, it was good.

122
00:04:24.574 --> 00:04:25.673
It was very good.

123
00:04:25.874 --> 00:04:27.783
This place is excellent. Everything tastes so good.

124
00:04:27.783 --> 00:04:29.244
(Their first dinner was successful thanks to Gu Ra's recommendations.)

125
00:04:30.713 --> 00:04:32.254
No, but look at it.

126
00:04:32.254 --> 00:04:33.353
The air is so fresh.

127
00:04:33.353 --> 00:04:35.254
- The air is so fresh. - This place is...

128
00:04:35.254 --> 00:04:37.223
- like 2°C. - It's very fresh.

129
00:04:37.223 --> 00:04:38.293
It's 2°C?

130
00:04:38.293 --> 00:04:41.223
See there. It says minus 1°C.

131
00:04:41.394 --> 00:04:43.863
- Oh, here it says. - That's saying it's minus one.

132
00:04:43.863 --> 00:04:45.934
So does this mean the building senses the temperature...

133
00:04:45.934 --> 00:04:47.903
- and displays it? - No, it's not like that.

134
00:04:47.903 --> 00:04:49.634
- It isn't right? - They sense it somewhere else.

135
00:04:49.634 --> 00:04:52.074
- I knew it. - Nobody makes it that way.

136
00:04:52.173 --> 00:04:53.944
Why are you making it hard?

137
00:04:53.944 --> 00:04:55.504
Did I do something wrong?

138
00:04:55.504 --> 00:04:56.603
Hey, friend. If I'm curious...

139
00:04:56.803 --> 00:04:58.074
You're the...

140
00:04:58.074 --> 00:05:00.173
You're the expert on this place.

141
00:05:00.173 --> 00:05:01.613
They measure it, and deliver the temperature to the display.

142
00:05:01.613 --> 00:05:03.954
Who makes such huge thermometer?

143
00:05:04.153 --> 00:05:05.553
I love it here.

144
00:05:06.783 --> 00:05:08.254
- The air is so fresh. - Yes, it is.

145
00:05:08.423 --> 00:05:09.783
I love how clean here is.

146
00:05:10.454 --> 00:05:13.663
I love this sound when I step on the snow.

147
00:05:13.863 --> 00:05:14.963
I love it.

148
00:05:15.963 --> 00:05:18.634
- I like it how there is no crowd. - Yes.

149
00:05:20.704 --> 00:05:23.134
You know so many places.

150
00:05:23.134 --> 00:05:24.733
Doesn't this place remind you of Bae Yong Joon?

151
00:05:24.733 --> 00:05:27.903
Rather than Bae Yong Joon, this is more like Snow White.

152
00:05:27.903 --> 00:05:29.103
Where is Bae Yong Joon?

153
00:05:29.603 --> 00:05:31.543
Where is Yong Joon?

154
00:05:33.173 --> 00:05:35.144
(In the middle of the city,)

155
00:05:36.014 --> 00:05:38.014
(there is a clock tower that has traces of its age.)

156
00:05:39.454 --> 00:05:42.483
(Ms. Oh is waiting for the lover who has left.)

157
00:05:43.353 --> 00:05:45.593
(There is a man who shares her feelings.)

158
00:05:46.853 --> 00:05:50.863
(It's Sang Ryeol with glasses that look like Yong Jun's glasses.)

159
00:05:51.793 --> 00:05:56.663
(The Sapporo Clock Tower looks like it will make all love come true.)

160
00:05:57.803 --> 00:05:59.233
What's inside the tower?

161
00:05:59.233 --> 00:06:01.274
It's a clock tower. Let me see what's inside.

162
00:06:01.403 --> 00:06:03.644
They have a closing time too.

163
00:06:04.343 --> 00:06:07.713
(The clock tower is already closed.)

164
00:06:07.814 --> 00:06:09.413
- Oh, you're right. - Yes.

165
00:06:09.713 --> 00:06:12.113
It's like some museum here.

166
00:06:12.113 --> 00:06:15.184
- I think it's... - Is it a historical museum?

167
00:06:15.184 --> 00:06:16.824
No, I mean a station.

168
00:06:16.923 --> 00:06:18.153
Oh, a station.

169
00:06:18.153 --> 00:06:19.994
- They have an entrance fee. - It's a station.

170
00:06:19.994 --> 00:06:21.423
It's an old station.

171
00:06:21.423 --> 00:06:24.163
- It's an old station. - There must be railways.

172
00:06:25.064 --> 00:06:27.363
(It's not a train station, it's an old school auditorium.)

173
00:06:27.963 --> 00:06:30.603
(It was built in 1878 and is an important cultural asset.)

174
00:06:30.603 --> 00:06:33.103
(It is used as a museum showing Sapporo's history.)

175
00:06:33.103 --> 00:06:37.613
(The clock works fine despite never having been fixed.)

176
00:06:37.613 --> 00:06:40.074
- It's an old station. - Yes, I told you.

177
00:06:40.343 --> 00:06:42.144
- It's a station, right? - Yes.

178
00:06:42.144 --> 00:06:44.754
People preserve it so nicely here.

179
00:06:45.014 --> 00:06:46.014
Let's go by subway.

180
00:06:46.014 --> 00:06:50.223
(Gu Ra was bragging about his knowledge on everything.)

181
00:06:50.394 --> 00:06:51.553
We have to get out from here.

182
00:06:51.553 --> 00:06:54.124
- It's JR! - Yes, it is.

183
00:06:55.163 --> 00:06:58.264
(He pretended as if he did not say anything wrong.)

184
00:06:58.663 --> 00:07:00.564
- This is old. - It was built it 1886.

185
00:07:00.764 --> 00:07:02.334
- Not even once? - Until today?

186
00:07:02.334 --> 00:07:04.204
The clock is about 150 years old.

187
00:07:04.204 --> 00:07:06.934
There are some people who maintain this clock.

188
00:07:06.934 --> 00:07:10.043
- Shall we take a photo? - Yes, from which angle?

189
00:07:10.043 --> 00:07:11.574
There must be a reason...

190
00:07:12.113 --> 00:07:16.384
why they designated a point.

191
00:07:16.384 --> 00:07:18.113
- The place looks great in photos. - You're right.

192
00:07:18.454 --> 00:07:19.853
- Isn't Bae Yong Joon coming? - Usually...

193
00:07:19.853 --> 00:07:20.954
- Usually... - Come on.

194
00:07:21.153 --> 00:07:22.723
- I'm sad. - Why?

195
00:07:22.723 --> 00:07:24.624
Yong Joon has never joined us.

196
00:07:24.624 --> 00:07:26.093
Where is the famous Yong Joon?

197
00:07:27.194 --> 00:07:29.593
(Here we are, Ms. Oh.)

198
00:07:30.334 --> 00:07:31.663
- Shall we go up here? - Yes.

199
00:07:31.663 --> 00:07:33.363
(The three friends are moving up to the photo zone.)

200
00:07:33.363 --> 00:07:35.733
- You should sit here. - Yes, I'll see the angle.

201
00:07:36.033 --> 00:07:37.233
How's the angle?

202
00:07:37.233 --> 00:07:38.274
(Hyeon Gyeong and Gu Ra are standing there to check angles.)

203
00:07:39.473 --> 00:07:43.644
- Is this spot right? - You look like a grim reaper!

204
00:07:44.173 --> 00:07:45.713
(Grim Reaper?)

205
00:07:46.444 --> 00:07:48.644
(A photo with Grim Reaper Gu Ra)

206
00:07:48.843 --> 00:07:50.584
(Fellows, it's time to go now.)

207
00:07:50.584 --> 00:07:53.723
- The lights are a bit off. - They should come from below.

208
00:07:53.723 --> 00:07:56.084
The lights come from below in broadcasts too.

209
00:07:56.084 --> 00:07:58.553
- Is it pretty that way? - It should be the same here.

210
00:07:58.553 --> 00:08:00.694
- Right. - There should be a reason.

211
00:08:01.163 --> 00:08:02.264
(Gu Ra volunteers to take a photo.)

212
00:08:02.264 --> 00:08:04.994
You know... What's this?

213
00:08:04.994 --> 00:08:07.064
The lights aren't too bad.

214
00:08:07.064 --> 00:08:08.064
- Really? - Yes.

215
00:08:08.064 --> 00:08:09.403
This is all right.

216
00:08:09.403 --> 00:08:11.103
- How should I... - Wait.

217
00:08:11.103 --> 00:08:12.634
- You look great. - Really?

218
00:08:12.634 --> 00:08:14.403
Open your face a bit more.

219
00:08:14.774 --> 00:08:16.074
Do it already.

220
00:08:16.704 --> 00:08:18.673
(Open my face?)

221
00:08:19.014 --> 00:08:20.983
Do you think my face is a door?

222
00:08:20.983 --> 00:08:22.713
- It's covered by your jacket. - Is it a door.

223
00:08:22.713 --> 00:08:24.053
I mean, your collar is covering your face.

224
00:08:24.053 --> 00:08:26.053
You should've said that first.

225
00:08:26.053 --> 00:08:27.153
Open my face?

226
00:08:27.153 --> 00:08:28.153
Do it already.

227
00:08:28.153 --> 00:08:29.624
Do you think my face is a door?

228
00:08:29.624 --> 00:08:31.494
I was wondering what you meant by that.

229
00:08:31.494 --> 00:08:33.094
But you look good in the picture.

230
00:08:33.094 --> 00:08:34.823
- Really? - It's not normal...

231
00:08:34.823 --> 00:08:36.823
- to look good in a photo at night. - Really?

232
00:08:36.823 --> 00:08:38.033
It came out nicely.

233
00:08:38.033 --> 00:08:40.163
(With Ms. Oh)

234
00:08:41.433 --> 00:08:44.533
(You have to open your face.)

235
00:08:44.604 --> 00:08:45.734
- Okay. - Take it nicely.

236
00:08:45.734 --> 00:08:48.644
Gosh, it's the best one. 1, 2, 3.

237
00:08:48.803 --> 00:08:50.673
1, 2, 3. Okay.

238
00:08:50.673 --> 00:08:52.413
- We got a nice one. - Did we?

239
00:08:52.413 --> 00:08:53.543
By the way...

240
00:08:53.614 --> 00:08:54.644
What? It didn't come out nicely?

241
00:08:54.644 --> 00:08:56.514
Why are your faces all so white?

242
00:08:56.514 --> 00:08:58.453
It's because of the lights.

243
00:08:58.453 --> 00:09:00.624
- Let me see how you took it. - I mean...

244
00:09:01.224 --> 00:09:02.254
Why you...

245
00:09:02.254 --> 00:09:05.053
- He took it from this way. - I look horrible in the picture.

246
00:09:05.494 --> 00:09:07.624
Gosh, what's this?

247
00:09:07.624 --> 00:09:10.663
- But she looks great in it. - She does.

248
00:09:10.663 --> 00:09:13.163
- Right. - I'm a Miss Korea after all.

249
00:09:13.163 --> 00:09:14.264
It's awful.

250
00:09:14.264 --> 00:09:16.234
- Goodness. - What's this?

251
00:09:16.234 --> 00:09:18.033
- You're horrible at taking photos. - I didn't do it on purpose.

252
00:09:18.033 --> 00:09:19.833
It's awful.

253
00:09:20.443 --> 00:09:22.604
(Though their pictures don't come out nicely,)

254
00:09:23.774 --> 00:09:27.514
(they're happy to be together.)

255
00:09:28.813 --> 00:09:31.014
(Our friendship...)

256
00:09:31.014 --> 00:09:33.354
(is doing fine today as well.)

257
00:09:34.024 --> 00:09:36.384
- Isn't it here? - It's here.

258
00:09:36.384 --> 00:09:39.053
- It's here. - The course we're taking is nice.

259
00:09:39.053 --> 00:09:40.793
- There's a tower. - There.

260
00:09:40.793 --> 00:09:42.024
There's an observatory.

261
00:09:42.024 --> 00:09:43.024
It's nice.

262
00:09:43.024 --> 00:09:45.264
It seems to be a traveling spot for sunrise watching.

263
00:09:45.264 --> 00:09:48.063
It's like Mount Nam in our country.

264
00:09:48.903 --> 00:09:49.903
It's pretty.

265
00:09:49.903 --> 00:09:52.874
- It's pretty. - You come here for the mood.

266
00:09:53.604 --> 00:09:55.874
We should have some gyudon while we're in Japan.

267
00:09:56.443 --> 00:09:58.214
(They head to the observatory in the elevator.)

268
00:09:58.714 --> 00:10:01.043
If Hyeon Gyeong holds a torch here,

269
00:10:01.043 --> 00:10:03.443
it will make her the Statue of Liberty.

270
00:10:03.443 --> 00:10:04.614
You like this kind of jokes?

271
00:10:04.614 --> 00:10:06.553
See? She doesn't like it.

272
00:10:06.553 --> 00:10:08.323
She shows her feelings now.

273
00:10:08.384 --> 00:10:10.293
Are we going to make a wish?

274
00:10:10.293 --> 00:10:12.653
- Let's enjoy the view. - It's scary.

275
00:10:12.653 --> 00:10:14.764
Gosh, I don't think I can go.

276
00:10:15.063 --> 00:10:16.264
It's scary.

277
00:10:16.264 --> 00:10:18.734
I get dizzier when I'm at a higher place.

278
00:10:18.734 --> 00:10:21.504
- By the way, - It's nice.

279
00:10:21.504 --> 00:10:25.234
the streets are aligned accurately.

280
00:10:25.234 --> 00:10:27.104
Look here. It's refreshing.

281
00:10:27.104 --> 00:10:30.344
- It's like Gwanghwamun. - It's nice.

282
00:10:30.573 --> 00:10:31.874
Look over there.

283
00:10:31.874 --> 00:10:34.083
- It's like some kind of a tower. - It's a ski resort.

284
00:10:34.083 --> 00:10:36.043
- Is it? - I think so.

285
00:10:36.043 --> 00:10:37.813
- It's good that we came at night. - I know.

286
00:10:37.813 --> 00:10:40.153
- It's a tour around the city. - Right.

287
00:10:40.153 --> 00:10:42.354
- It's amazing. - Right.

288
00:10:42.354 --> 00:10:46.224
Let's make a wish for our 10-year friendship.

289
00:10:46.354 --> 00:10:49.964
I hope you all stay healthy.

290
00:10:49.964 --> 00:10:52.163
- It's important to be healthy. - Right.

291
00:10:52.163 --> 00:10:53.464
The people around you must be happy.

292
00:10:53.464 --> 00:10:56.464
- You're right. - I hope I become more flexible.

293
00:10:56.464 --> 00:10:59.303
I'm planning to live this year...

294
00:10:59.303 --> 00:11:02.403
as the start of receiving a lot of love from the public.

295
00:11:02.644 --> 00:11:04.313
I want to love many people.

296
00:11:04.313 --> 00:11:06.344
I want a lot of them to love me too.

297
00:11:06.344 --> 00:11:08.214
Everything is included in love.

298
00:11:08.214 --> 00:11:11.254
His voice has become softer indeed.

299
00:11:11.254 --> 00:11:13.624
- That's my wish. - Maybe he got his fortune read.

300
00:11:13.823 --> 00:11:16.783
You've become a lot nicer. I guess he heard stuff...

301
00:11:16.783 --> 00:11:18.823
like he is going to die.

302
00:11:19.423 --> 00:11:22.094
- I should've asked that first. - In the past,

303
00:11:22.094 --> 00:11:24.134
we all hoped to be loved by the public,

304
00:11:24.134 --> 00:11:26.094
but it's very hard to be loved.

305
00:11:26.094 --> 00:11:27.163
- Right. - It's not easy.

306
00:11:27.163 --> 00:11:29.104
- It's the hardest. - It's not easy.

307
00:11:29.104 --> 00:11:30.933
- That's how I feel. - Good.

308
00:11:30.933 --> 00:11:32.333
What about you, Hyeon Gyeong?

309
00:11:32.333 --> 00:11:34.573
Me? My wish is...

310
00:11:34.573 --> 00:11:37.274
- I want to put down my expectation. - Right.

311
00:11:37.274 --> 00:11:39.214
Parents usually worry about their children.

312
00:11:39.214 --> 00:11:42.244
But as I get older, I take my experience as an excuse...

313
00:11:42.244 --> 00:11:45.283
to nag and give advice to my daughter.

314
00:11:45.783 --> 00:11:47.183
I see.

315
00:11:47.183 --> 00:11:48.953
I should lay down my expectation on my child first.

316
00:11:48.953 --> 00:11:51.394
It's hard to stand even the smallest thing...

317
00:11:51.394 --> 00:11:53.254
when it comes to my child.

318
00:11:53.254 --> 00:11:55.793
- It's not easy. - It's not.

319
00:11:55.964 --> 00:11:58.163
- You see... - It's not easy.

320
00:11:58.833 --> 00:12:02.033
Like Gu Ra's wish,

321
00:12:02.033 --> 00:12:05.634
I want ourselves to be happy first.

322
00:12:05.903 --> 00:12:07.203
(Staring)

323
00:12:07.573 --> 00:12:09.374
As an old friend of yours,

324
00:12:09.374 --> 00:12:12.014
- I hope you get married this year. - Me too.

325
00:12:12.014 --> 00:12:13.313
Me too.

326
00:12:13.313 --> 00:12:15.714
- You're such a nice person. - Come to think...

327
00:12:15.714 --> 00:12:18.484
You have to put down the thought about your age.

328
00:12:18.484 --> 00:12:20.754
- Right. - It's meaningless...

329
00:12:20.754 --> 00:12:23.583
to find someone in her late 30s now.

330
00:12:23.583 --> 00:12:27.923
Women in their early or mid 40s should be in your consideration too.

331
00:12:28.624 --> 00:12:30.833
- Women... - In their early or mid 40s.

332
00:12:30.833 --> 00:12:33.234
Extend your limit. What's wrong?

333
00:12:33.234 --> 00:12:34.364
Come on.

334
00:12:34.364 --> 00:12:35.803
I mean...

335
00:12:35.803 --> 00:12:37.933
- He's right. - You...

336
00:12:37.933 --> 00:12:39.073
- I'm right. - He's right.

337
00:12:39.073 --> 00:12:41.874
- I'm not saying that you're wrong. - He's right.

338
00:12:41.874 --> 00:12:43.403
Hear me out.

339
00:12:43.403 --> 00:12:44.614
- For me too. - Why are you laughing?

340
00:12:44.614 --> 00:12:46.614
I'm only saying if you're getting married.

341
00:12:46.614 --> 00:12:49.913
I don't care whether she was married once or not.

342
00:12:49.913 --> 00:12:52.313
I'm totally okay with it.

343
00:12:52.313 --> 00:12:54.724
Let's talk about this issue while we're at it.

344
00:12:54.724 --> 00:12:57.293
Who are some celebrities in their early or mid 40s?

345
00:12:57.293 --> 00:12:59.453
- It doesn't have to be a celebrity. - Look for a non-celebrity.

346
00:12:59.453 --> 00:13:00.764
That way,

347
00:13:00.764 --> 00:13:02.624
I can have a grasp of how they would look.

348
00:13:02.624 --> 00:13:04.234
There's one.

349
00:13:04.234 --> 00:13:05.394
Song Eun Yi.

350
00:13:06.333 --> 00:13:09.933
They're all your friends.

351
00:13:09.933 --> 00:13:12.634
- What about Kim Sook? - She's in her early 40s too.

352
00:13:12.634 --> 00:13:14.403
- They're really nice women. - They're the ones.

353
00:13:14.403 --> 00:13:17.214
Eun Yi is in her mid 40s, and Sook is in her early 40s.

354
00:13:17.214 --> 00:13:18.274
But...

355
00:13:18.274 --> 00:13:20.274
- I love the two so much. - Right.

356
00:13:20.274 --> 00:13:21.943
I love them.

357
00:13:21.943 --> 00:13:23.514
(They're great.)

358
00:13:23.953 --> 00:13:25.384
- Let's go down now. - Okay.

359
00:13:25.384 --> 00:13:26.714
Go down first.

360
00:13:26.714 --> 00:13:27.754
Come already.

361
00:13:28.224 --> 00:13:30.823
- There's no answer to life. - Goodness.

362
00:13:30.823 --> 00:13:34.693
(They head to Tanuki Koji Station.)

363
00:13:34.793 --> 00:13:35.864
It's here.

364
00:13:35.864 --> 00:13:37.464
- So people won't be cold. - It's written in Korean.

365
00:13:37.464 --> 00:13:39.134
- "Tanuki Koji". - "Tanuki Koji".

366
00:13:39.134 --> 00:13:41.403
There are a lot of things to buy.

367
00:13:41.403 --> 00:13:43.604
There are a lot of things here.

368
00:13:43.604 --> 00:13:46.474
(Various stores and restaurants are located in this area.)

369
00:13:47.303 --> 00:13:49.644
(It's the old shopping district, Tanuki Koji.)

370
00:13:50.274 --> 00:13:51.874
This traditional market looks decent.

371
00:13:51.874 --> 00:13:54.813
- Let's do some shopping. - It's a traditional market?

372
00:13:54.813 --> 00:13:56.214
It's not a mall?

373
00:13:56.214 --> 00:13:58.354
Well, it's a mall that's like a market.

374
00:13:58.354 --> 00:14:00.783
We should vitalize this place a bit.

375
00:14:00.783 --> 00:14:04.053
It's not so busy. It's not busy at all.

376
00:14:04.423 --> 00:14:06.354
- What's that? - What's this?

377
00:14:06.354 --> 00:14:08.163
- Shall we go in here? - This looks nice.

378
00:14:08.163 --> 00:14:09.423
It looks nice.

379
00:14:09.864 --> 00:14:11.894
- This place looks nice. - It's closed?

380
00:14:12.964 --> 00:14:14.004
It's closed?

381
00:14:14.004 --> 00:14:15.004
(The store is closed.)

382
00:14:15.004 --> 00:14:16.563
They're closed.

383
00:14:16.563 --> 00:14:17.673
See you.

384
00:14:19.504 --> 00:14:21.274
They're closed.

385
00:14:21.274 --> 00:14:23.274
So they close their stores around this time.

386
00:14:23.274 --> 00:14:25.714
- It's 10pm. - They're closed because it's 10pm.

387
00:14:25.714 --> 00:14:28.484
But it's good to have not many people around us.

388
00:14:28.484 --> 00:14:30.144
- It's a pharmacy. - They might sell it here.

389
00:14:30.144 --> 00:14:31.653
- It's closed. - It's closed.

390
00:14:31.653 --> 00:14:34.283
Some stores are still open.

391
00:14:34.283 --> 00:14:37.293
- This store has various things too. - Right.

392
00:14:37.293 --> 00:14:38.793
How long are they opened?

393
00:14:39.693 --> 00:14:42.423
- People are shopping in the store. - It looks open.

394
00:14:42.423 --> 00:14:43.793
Let's go in then.

395
00:14:43.793 --> 00:14:45.464
- Hello. - Hello.

396
00:14:45.464 --> 00:14:46.734
It's nice.

397
00:14:46.734 --> 00:14:48.933
When you have trouble going into sleep,

398
00:14:48.933 --> 00:14:51.303
- this keeps you warm. - Guys.

399
00:14:51.303 --> 00:14:54.244
Since we collected money, let's buy one item each.

400
00:14:54.573 --> 00:14:56.573
- What we want to buy. - Let's each buy...

401
00:14:56.573 --> 00:14:57.813
- something we need. - Let's do it.

402
00:14:57.813 --> 00:14:59.844
I'm going to buy some pain relief patches.

403
00:14:59.844 --> 00:15:00.913
You wanted pain relief patches.

404
00:15:00.913 --> 00:15:02.413
I found them.

405
00:15:02.413 --> 00:15:03.813
- They're the coin patches. - People buy a lot of these.

406
00:15:03.813 --> 00:15:04.884
- This. - Oh, this?

407
00:15:04.884 --> 00:15:06.183
Not this one.

408
00:15:06.183 --> 00:15:07.984
- These are the ones. - A lot of people buy these.

409
00:15:07.984 --> 00:15:09.224
Are they good?

410
00:15:09.384 --> 00:15:12.254
A lot of tourists buy these patches here.

411
00:15:12.624 --> 00:15:14.464
- These are the ones. - Welcome.

412
00:15:14.994 --> 00:15:16.464
- Buy items worth 30 dollars. - That's how it should be.

413
00:15:16.464 --> 00:15:18.464
Buy items worth about 30 dollars.

414
00:15:18.464 --> 00:15:19.464
30 dollars.

415
00:15:19.464 --> 00:15:21.734
- It's the budget for each of us. - All right.

416
00:15:22.163 --> 00:15:23.504
(What should I get?)

417
00:15:24.504 --> 00:15:26.673
(Gu Ra goes upstairs to search for items.)

418
00:15:28.043 --> 00:15:30.774
(Hyeon Gyeong goes to check discount items.)

419
00:15:30.943 --> 00:15:33.214
There are so many kinds of masks.

420
00:15:33.214 --> 00:15:34.283
(What did they get?)

421
00:15:34.283 --> 00:15:35.313
What did you buy?

422
00:15:35.313 --> 00:15:37.354
- We all got pain relief patches. - I got these.

423
00:15:37.354 --> 00:15:38.714
- Really? - Pain relief patches.

424
00:15:38.714 --> 00:15:40.083
- What about you? - Me too.

425
00:15:40.083 --> 00:15:43.583
I thought I needed things to relieve my fatigue.

426
00:15:43.583 --> 00:15:46.394
Among all the medications, we only got pain relief patches.

427
00:15:46.394 --> 00:15:47.894
- It's a must-have item. - It caught my eyes.

428
00:15:47.894 --> 00:15:49.923
Why don't we just go get some acupuncture treatment?

429
00:15:49.923 --> 00:15:51.933
And I got this one too.

430
00:15:51.933 --> 00:15:53.594
- What's that? - This.

431
00:15:53.594 --> 00:15:55.234
- Oh, nose hair scissors? - Yes.

432
00:15:55.504 --> 00:15:58.004
I tried to pluck out nose hair with my fingers once, and it went bad.

433
00:15:58.004 --> 00:15:59.703
I need this.

434
00:15:59.703 --> 00:16:02.244
When you get old, you shouldn't use sharp scissors.

435
00:16:02.244 --> 00:16:04.413
Your hand gets shaky that you could scratch the inside of your nose.

436
00:16:04.474 --> 00:16:06.043
- Right. - Let's move to our hotel first.

437
00:16:06.043 --> 00:16:07.984
- Let's go. - Let's go.

438
00:16:07.984 --> 00:16:09.514
(They head to their accommodations.)

439
00:16:09.514 --> 00:16:11.783
It's going great so far.

440
00:16:12.783 --> 00:16:16.124
Go in. I'll see you tomorrow, Hyeon Gyeong.

441
00:16:17.224 --> 00:16:20.124
(Hyeon Gyeong enters her room.)

442
00:16:22.494 --> 00:16:24.134
(Sitting on a bed)

443
00:16:25.364 --> 00:16:28.033
(She organizes her stuff before going to bed.)

444
00:16:29.333 --> 00:16:32.403
My nose hair scissors.

445
00:16:33.274 --> 00:16:35.043
- Two of these. - Right.

446
00:16:35.043 --> 00:16:36.673
- Right? - Those are yours.

447
00:16:36.673 --> 00:16:38.274
I should apply some of these on my body before I go to bed.

448
00:16:38.274 --> 00:16:39.813
- Go to bed already. - All right.

449
00:16:40.844 --> 00:16:44.083
(The night deepens.)

450
00:16:45.683 --> 00:16:48.484
(The morning of Sapporo comes.)

451
00:16:50.394 --> 00:16:53.624
(The three friends agreed to have breakfast at 6:45am.)

452
00:16:54.494 --> 00:16:57.333
(How's the breakfast served in the hotel?)

453
00:16:58.134 --> 00:17:01.433
(The restaurant is full of delicious dishes.)

454
00:17:01.864 --> 00:17:04.603
(It looks yummy.)

455
00:17:05.373 --> 00:17:07.843
(Gu Ra is the first to appear.)

456
00:17:09.573 --> 00:17:11.613
(I'm hungry.)

457
00:17:12.643 --> 00:17:14.414
(What will bread-lover, Gu Ra, have for breakfast?)

458
00:17:16.444 --> 00:17:18.684
(He gets a lot of rice first.)

459
00:17:23.454 --> 00:17:24.994
Is this our table?

460
00:17:24.994 --> 00:17:27.123
(Sang Ryeol arrives next.)

461
00:17:28.494 --> 00:17:30.293
There is a lot of good food.

462
00:17:31.464 --> 00:17:34.303
- Good morning. - Hi.

463
00:17:34.303 --> 00:17:36.404
Good morning.

464
00:17:36.904 --> 00:17:37.974
Did you have a good night?

465
00:17:37.974 --> 00:17:39.603
I had a great night.

466
00:17:39.603 --> 00:17:41.444
You look like you slept well.

467
00:17:41.444 --> 00:17:43.813
They have all kinds of dishes.

468
00:17:43.813 --> 00:17:44.944
(Gu Ra seems to greet her.)

469
00:17:45.714 --> 00:17:47.643
I didn't have any rice yesterday.

470
00:17:47.643 --> 00:17:49.714
(But he focuses on getting his food again.)

471
00:17:50.553 --> 00:17:52.154
I haven't had rice yet.

472
00:17:53.383 --> 00:17:54.984
I'm hungry. Gosh, I'm starving.

473
00:17:54.984 --> 00:17:56.053
(Gu Ra sits down first.)

474
00:17:57.593 --> 00:17:59.424
(He mainly picked Korean dishes.)

475
00:18:00.393 --> 00:18:01.464
Thank you.

476
00:18:02.694 --> 00:18:03.893
(These two share everything.)

477
00:18:03.893 --> 00:18:05.033
Doesn't everything look so good?

478
00:18:05.033 --> 00:18:06.664
Everything looks amazing.

479
00:18:06.764 --> 00:18:09.603
I never used to eat rice, but these days, I can't function without it.

480
00:18:09.603 --> 00:18:10.674
(Hotel breakfast in Sapporo)

481
00:18:11.204 --> 00:18:13.033
- Did you fall asleep right away? - I did.

482
00:18:13.033 --> 00:18:16.373
But I heard someone snoring.

483
00:18:16.373 --> 00:18:17.414
It wasn't me.

484
00:18:17.674 --> 00:18:18.813
Was it you?

485
00:18:19.043 --> 00:18:20.643
I barely got any sleep.

486
00:18:20.643 --> 00:18:21.984
- Why didn't you sleep? - Well...

487
00:18:21.984 --> 00:18:23.484
Did thinking about me keep you up?

488
00:18:23.484 --> 00:18:25.014
Your room is right next to ours, you know.

489
00:18:25.984 --> 00:18:27.853
- That's what kept you up? - I fell asleep right away.

490
00:18:28.283 --> 00:18:30.224
I went to bed just after 11pm.

491
00:18:31.053 --> 00:18:32.654
- You got a lot of sleep. - I slept very well.

492
00:18:32.654 --> 00:18:34.764
That shows how healthy you are.

493
00:18:35.063 --> 00:18:36.994
Healthy people sleep well.

494
00:18:37.393 --> 00:18:39.934
I used to eat bread at places like this when I was younger,

495
00:18:39.934 --> 00:18:41.204
- but I can't do that anymore. - Me neither.

496
00:18:41.204 --> 00:18:43.504
Why is it that foods made with wheat become harder to digest...

497
00:18:43.504 --> 00:18:45.404
as we get older?

498
00:18:45.504 --> 00:18:47.143
- I know, right? - I can't figure out why.

499
00:18:47.143 --> 00:18:48.843
I eat rice no matter where I go.

500
00:18:50.774 --> 00:18:53.883
(These middle-aged folks love Korean food.)

501
00:18:55.414 --> 00:18:56.514
(Eating)

502
00:18:59.254 --> 00:19:02.454
I must say, this hotel has the best breakfast options I've ever seen.

503
00:19:02.454 --> 00:19:03.954
- I'm with you. - The food is good.

504
00:19:03.954 --> 00:19:05.694
I guess that's why we came here.

505
00:19:05.694 --> 00:19:06.793
Gosh, it's really good.

506
00:19:07.863 --> 00:19:08.863
I'm so happy right now.

507
00:19:09.224 --> 00:19:11.033
- The tofu is very good. - It's so good.

508
00:19:11.033 --> 00:19:12.734
- This tofu. - I like tofu.

509
00:19:13.264 --> 00:19:14.303
My gosh.

510
00:19:14.464 --> 00:19:15.504
- You say that a lot. - "My gosh."

511
00:19:15.504 --> 00:19:16.633
You keep saying that.

512
00:19:16.633 --> 00:19:19.704
I also noticed that he sings when he's alone.

513
00:19:19.704 --> 00:19:20.774
When did you start doing that?

514
00:19:21.073 --> 00:19:23.873
- Do I? Really? - You hum like this. I thought...

515
00:19:24.143 --> 00:19:25.674
- Seriously. - Yes!

516
00:19:25.674 --> 00:19:27.214
I never hum or exclaim like that.

517
00:19:27.214 --> 00:19:28.883
- You should watch it later. - Gosh, you totally do.

518
00:19:28.883 --> 00:19:30.883
- You actually do it a lot. - Earlier, you were like...

519
00:19:32.214 --> 00:19:33.514
(Oh, my.)

520
00:19:34.024 --> 00:19:37.593
(He kept doing it with every breath.)

521
00:19:38.494 --> 00:19:40.694
I had no idea. This is the first time I'm hearing it.

522
00:19:42.464 --> 00:19:43.893
We can get going right away.

523
00:19:43.893 --> 00:19:45.764
We're going to that place today, right?

524
00:19:45.764 --> 00:19:47.133
Near the hot spring,

525
00:19:47.133 --> 00:19:49.603
there's a sledging slope.

526
00:19:49.603 --> 00:19:50.873
All right, let's do that.

527
00:19:50.873 --> 00:19:52.373
- Let's check it out. - Sounds good.

528
00:19:52.373 --> 00:19:54.244
Oh, right. I have to take my supplements.

529
00:19:54.244 --> 00:19:55.303
What kind of supplements?

530
00:19:55.303 --> 00:19:56.373
My vitamins.

531
00:19:56.373 --> 00:19:57.414
(They get energized with vitamins.)

532
00:19:57.414 --> 00:20:00.843
If you have vitamin C, I'd like one. Do you have it?

533
00:20:01.843 --> 00:20:04.184
(The 3 friends' destination is Biei on the Sang Ryeol Tour.)

534
00:20:05.684 --> 00:20:07.123
(The White Beard Waterfall...)

535
00:20:08.024 --> 00:20:09.954
(and the scenery are a must-see.)

536
00:20:10.954 --> 00:20:12.353
(You can enjoy various winter activities too!)

537
00:20:14.024 --> 00:20:15.793
(To the winter wonderland, Biei)

538
00:20:16.764 --> 00:20:19.234
(It takes about 3 hours to get to Biei from Sapporo.)

539
00:20:19.234 --> 00:20:20.833
I've done a bit of research.

540
00:20:20.833 --> 00:20:23.533
You guys will be moved when you get there.

541
00:20:23.974 --> 00:20:26.633
I don't even think I slept for 30 minutes last night.

542
00:20:26.633 --> 00:20:27.974
- Why? - I just couldn't sleep.

543
00:20:27.974 --> 00:20:28.974
- You couldn't fall asleep? - No.

544
00:20:28.974 --> 00:20:30.914
- Hey. - Is it because I'm not at home?

545
00:20:30.914 --> 00:20:32.043
You know what?

546
00:20:32.043 --> 00:20:33.514
I can sleep well anywhere.

547
00:20:33.883 --> 00:20:36.113
Yeom Gyeong Hwan falls asleep the second he rests his head somewhere.

548
00:20:36.954 --> 00:20:38.154
- He should be grateful for that. - I know.

549
00:20:38.154 --> 00:20:39.184
He really should be grateful.

550
00:20:39.184 --> 00:20:40.524
- Yeom Gyeong Hwan? - Yes.

551
00:20:41.123 --> 00:20:42.783
He stays home alone all the time.

552
00:20:43.184 --> 00:20:44.754
He lives alone in Cheongna, right?

553
00:20:44.754 --> 00:20:45.793
Yes, his family is abroad.

554
00:20:46.123 --> 00:20:48.063
He has it better than I do though.

555
00:20:48.164 --> 00:20:49.424
He at least has children.

556
00:20:51.533 --> 00:20:53.133
(They suddenly feel downcast.)

557
00:20:54.204 --> 00:20:55.563
(Yawning)

558
00:20:55.563 --> 00:20:57.174
- Get some sleep, Gu Ra. - I should.

559
00:20:57.174 --> 00:20:59.603
Hey, you need to sleep when you're on a highway.

560
00:20:59.603 --> 00:21:01.744
- We're on a highway now. - Right, we should sleep.

561
00:21:01.744 --> 00:21:03.543
But why do we have to sleep when we're on a highway?

562
00:21:03.643 --> 00:21:04.643
Hey, when you're on a highway...

563
00:21:04.643 --> 00:21:06.244
- That's what highways are for. - Exactly.

564
00:21:06.244 --> 00:21:08.444
- It's the best time to sleep. - We can relax.

565
00:21:08.444 --> 00:21:09.543
Let's get out of this highway!

566
00:21:09.543 --> 00:21:11.014
(I don't want to sleep.)

567
00:21:11.014 --> 00:21:12.484
- Let's sleep. - We should get some sleep.

568
00:21:12.484 --> 00:21:13.514
- We should. - You need some sleep.

569
00:21:13.514 --> 00:21:14.924
We have to be well rested to have fun there.

570
00:21:14.924 --> 00:21:16.883
I think we should stop talking.

571
00:21:16.883 --> 00:21:18.093
Ma'am.

572
00:21:18.093 --> 00:21:19.954
(They'll get some sleep since they're on a highway now.)

573
00:21:21.793 --> 00:21:23.494
(They've become quiet very soon.)

574
00:21:27.434 --> 00:21:29.704
(He looks like a woman who's fallen asleep while getting her hair done.)

575
00:21:30.373 --> 00:21:32.873
(Gu Ra is fast asleep with his hair all wrapped up.)

576
00:21:32.873 --> 00:21:35.244
I gave you a lot more than what any other companies can offer.

577
00:21:35.244 --> 00:21:36.404
(Mumbling)

578
00:21:36.404 --> 00:21:38.674
(Hyeon Gyeong keeps mumbling something to herself.)

579
00:21:40.383 --> 00:21:43.313
(This actress with 30 years of experience is practicing her lines.)

580
00:21:43.313 --> 00:21:44.914
I'll give you full support.

581
00:21:45.353 --> 00:21:46.954
(Shall I really get started now?)

582
00:21:48.583 --> 00:21:50.353
We must verify it.

583
00:21:50.353 --> 00:21:51.553
(She's so charismatic.)

584
00:21:51.724 --> 00:21:55.224
All you need to do is write. I'll take care of the rest.

585
00:21:57.593 --> 00:21:58.863
(We'll sleep.)

586
00:21:58.863 --> 00:22:05.033
(Ms. Actress, you can keep practicing your lines.)

587
00:22:06.474 --> 00:22:10.974
(Hyeon Gyeong kept on practicing her lines for a long time.)

588
00:22:13.113 --> 00:22:15.944
(After passing through a quaint little village,)

589
00:22:15.944 --> 00:22:17.754
(they still have to drive 3 more hours.)

590
00:22:17.754 --> 00:22:19.083
We're here, Hyeon Gyeong.

591
00:22:19.083 --> 00:22:20.353
- Okay. - You can get off now.

592
00:22:20.353 --> 00:22:21.353
(They've finally arrived in Biei.)

593
00:22:21.353 --> 00:22:22.484
We came so far.

594
00:22:23.484 --> 00:22:25.293
Isn't it beautiful? Aren't you happy you're here?

595
00:22:25.293 --> 00:22:26.424
Yes. This is...

596
00:22:26.424 --> 00:22:28.893
My, it's really beautiful here. It's like a scene from a fairy tale.

597
00:22:31.133 --> 00:22:33.494
Tell Park Hyo Shin to come here and sing "Snow Flower".

598
00:22:35.004 --> 00:22:37.573
(We feel as if we're about to hear...)

599
00:22:37.573 --> 00:22:40.303
(Park Hyo Shin's song echoing everywhere in this village.)

600
00:22:41.174 --> 00:22:43.674
(Biei is covered in snow.)

601
00:22:44.474 --> 00:22:46.543
(You can enjoy sledge rides right in front of your house,)

602
00:22:48.283 --> 00:22:51.014
(and every home needs a snowplow to remove snow.)

603
00:22:51.414 --> 00:22:54.484
(It's a picturesque winter town.)

604
00:22:54.524 --> 00:22:55.684
It's so nice here.

605
00:22:55.984 --> 00:22:58.694
- My, the sound of the snow. - Gosh, there's so much snow here.

606
00:22:58.694 --> 00:23:00.024
- Can you guys hear this? - It's really nice here.

607
00:23:00.664 --> 00:23:02.593
- The texture of the snow... - Look at how much snow is piled up.

608
00:23:03.224 --> 00:23:05.563
I must say, the houses here...

609
00:23:06.033 --> 00:23:08.004
look like designer boutiques.

610
00:23:08.004 --> 00:23:09.563
- Oh, actually... - When Ilsan was redeveloped...

611
00:23:09.563 --> 00:23:10.803
There's something interesting.

612
00:23:10.803 --> 00:23:13.704
You guys see those numbers, right?

613
00:23:13.704 --> 00:23:16.244
- Yes, 1917. - It means it was built in 1917.

614
00:23:16.244 --> 00:23:18.143
- Oh, really? - Yes, it's the year...

615
00:23:18.143 --> 00:23:19.613
- That number? - the building was built.

616
00:23:19.613 --> 00:23:21.043
- That number? - I see 1958 there.

617
00:23:21.043 --> 00:23:22.783
It means that was built in 1958.

618
00:23:22.783 --> 00:23:23.954
That one was built in 1917.

619
00:23:23.954 --> 00:23:25.654
This one was built in 1992.

620
00:23:25.654 --> 00:23:27.154
- Then this one is... - That's what they mean.

621
00:23:27.853 --> 00:23:29.883
Even the trees. Look at those trees.

622
00:23:30.123 --> 00:23:32.994
Branches usually get bent when there's that much snow piled up,

623
00:23:33.293 --> 00:23:36.393
but these trees have built resilience to withstand the weight.

624
00:23:37.033 --> 00:23:38.764
Well, when it snows... Hey.

625
00:23:38.764 --> 00:23:41.333
- They're not roofs. - What I meant was...

626
00:23:41.333 --> 00:23:43.164
This isn't a flatland. The snow falls down.

627
00:23:43.164 --> 00:23:44.404
No, they get bent.

628
00:23:44.404 --> 00:23:45.674
- No, they don't. - Look at them.

629
00:23:45.674 --> 00:23:46.803
- The snow falls down. - It's all frozen.

630
00:23:46.803 --> 00:23:48.244
- They can withstand this much snow. - No.

631
00:23:48.373 --> 00:23:50.103
Trees must have that much resilience.

632
00:23:50.103 --> 00:23:51.514
- Hey. - I thought this was over.

633
00:23:51.514 --> 00:23:52.873
Hey, listen.

634
00:23:52.873 --> 00:23:56.744
Look at that. Most branches bend from the weight.

635
00:23:56.744 --> 00:23:57.754
Hey, look.

636
00:23:57.754 --> 00:24:01.353
All the trees in this region are needle leaf trees.

637
00:24:01.353 --> 00:24:02.924
I don't want to get involved in this.

638
00:24:02.924 --> 00:24:04.393
- They have spiky leaves. - I don't want to be in trouble.

639
00:24:04.393 --> 00:24:06.694
The leaves are spiky. They're not broad-leaved.

640
00:24:06.694 --> 00:24:09.194
- I know that, but... - Because of the spiky leaves,

641
00:24:09.194 --> 00:24:10.793
there isn't much space for snow...

642
00:24:10.793 --> 00:24:12.734
- to pile up on. - All right, Mr. Gardener.

643
00:24:13.494 --> 00:24:15.833
What do you mean by "gardener"? You want me to be a landscaper?

644
00:24:15.833 --> 00:24:17.333
(Will they keep bickering at each other?)

645
00:24:19.303 --> 00:24:20.504
(The 5 guys at the sledding slope)

646
00:24:21.674 --> 00:24:22.974
(Daniel is so excited.)

647
00:24:23.843 --> 00:24:25.214
(Joong Wan is a little heavy for the sled.)

648
00:24:26.373 --> 00:24:27.543
(Jae Hwan caws like a crow.)

649
00:24:28.543 --> 00:24:30.313
(Jeong Soo wants to look cool.)

650
00:24:31.053 --> 00:24:33.313
(Seong Woo wants to look cool too.)

651
00:24:34.083 --> 00:24:35.783
(Now, they head over to the mid-level slope.)

652
00:24:37.793 --> 00:24:39.853
(The 5 guys' sledding competition in the early morning)

653
00:24:39.994 --> 00:24:41.363
The rail looks nice. I like it.

654
00:24:41.363 --> 00:24:42.393
(They're on standby.)

655
00:24:42.393 --> 00:24:43.833
- The rail looks sturdy. - All right.

656
00:24:44.694 --> 00:24:45.934
This is a practice game, right?

657
00:24:46.363 --> 00:24:47.533
Yes, it's a practice game.

658
00:24:49.404 --> 00:24:50.774
(Even though it's just a practice game,)

659
00:24:50.774 --> 00:24:53.474
(it's like the last rehearsal before the real showdown.)

660
00:24:54.343 --> 00:24:57.573
(The preliminary round of the sledding competition)

661
00:24:57.573 --> 00:24:58.674
Ready...

662
00:24:58.674 --> 00:24:59.674
(They're told to get ready.)

663
00:25:00.543 --> 00:25:01.583
Go.

664
00:25:01.583 --> 00:25:02.643
(Let's go.)

665
00:25:04.383 --> 00:25:05.813
(They leave the start line at the same time.)

666
00:25:07.783 --> 00:25:10.424
(Jae Hwan is beating everyone.)

667
00:25:11.524 --> 00:25:12.893
(Screaming excitedly)

668
00:25:13.524 --> 00:25:15.264
(This loud guy is right behind Jae Hwan.)

669
00:25:17.393 --> 00:25:18.393
Let's go!

670
00:25:18.934 --> 00:25:19.934
Let's go!

671
00:25:19.934 --> 00:25:20.934
(Stop right there!)

672
00:25:22.033 --> 00:25:23.833
(Jeong Soo and Daniel are slow.)

673
00:25:25.404 --> 00:25:26.674
I'm too slow.

674
00:25:27.143 --> 00:25:29.174
- My gosh! - Here I come. Faster!

675
00:25:29.174 --> 00:25:30.244
Faster!

676
00:25:32.274 --> 00:25:35.143
(Jae Hwan and Joong Wan come in first place together.)

677
00:25:35.143 --> 00:25:36.414
(Flopping)

678
00:25:38.583 --> 00:25:42.184
(Seong Woo comes in third place.)

679
00:25:42.254 --> 00:25:43.694
Gosh, I came in last.

680
00:25:44.494 --> 00:25:46.154
I got snow all over me because of Jeong Soo.

681
00:25:48.264 --> 00:25:49.764
(Laughing)

682
00:25:51.164 --> 00:25:52.464
That was really fun.

683
00:25:52.464 --> 00:25:53.494
(Jae Hwan and Joong Wan enjoyed it.)

684
00:25:53.494 --> 00:25:54.533
I had so much fun.

685
00:25:54.863 --> 00:25:56.533
I think I came in dead last.

686
00:25:56.974 --> 00:25:58.734
- No, Jeong Soo. - Gosh, my eyes...

687
00:25:58.974 --> 00:26:00.573
So who came in 1st and 2nd?

688
00:26:00.573 --> 00:26:02.603
- You and me, I think. - Oh, really?

689
00:26:02.603 --> 00:26:04.873
- That means we're safe. - Yes, we are.

690
00:26:05.274 --> 00:26:07.714
- Jae Hwan is really good. - Yes, he is.

691
00:26:07.714 --> 00:26:08.914
- What's your secret? - Tell us.

692
00:26:08.914 --> 00:26:10.143
How do you do it? Tell us already.

693
00:26:10.143 --> 00:26:11.214
- What's your secret? - How do you do it?

694
00:26:11.214 --> 00:26:13.053
You just have to enjoy it.

695
00:26:13.113 --> 00:26:14.383
- Goodness. - That's so vague.

696
00:26:14.383 --> 00:26:16.083
Is that what makes a genius?

697
00:26:16.083 --> 00:26:17.553
Not effort? I guess enjoying it is key.

698
00:26:17.553 --> 00:26:18.593
Just enjoy it, guys.

699
00:26:18.893 --> 00:26:19.924
So what's the penalty?

700
00:26:20.093 --> 00:26:22.524
Rubbing snow all over the face.

701
00:26:22.793 --> 00:26:23.793
(The game is finally on.)

702
00:26:23.793 --> 00:26:25.994
- That's so cruel. - Putting snow underneath clothes.

703
00:26:26.333 --> 00:26:27.363
Gosh, no way.

704
00:26:27.363 --> 00:26:28.934
- I don't like that. - You have to tolerate it.

705
00:26:28.934 --> 00:26:30.204
And you have to keep smiling.

706
00:26:30.204 --> 00:26:32.404
You just have to win. You won't have to do it if you win.

707
00:26:33.404 --> 00:26:36.873
It might hurt a bit, so we should wish each other a happy new year.

708
00:26:36.904 --> 00:26:39.343
- While doing it? - That will take longer.

709
00:26:39.343 --> 00:26:40.484
- Hey. - I'm just...

710
00:26:40.484 --> 00:26:42.143
He's so evil.

711
00:26:42.143 --> 00:26:44.014
Are we going to be like, "I love you",

712
00:26:44.014 --> 00:26:45.154
as we're shoving snow in?

713
00:26:45.154 --> 00:26:47.224
I thought he was going to suggest something else because it'll hurt.

714
00:26:47.553 --> 00:26:48.754
I wasn't expecting him to say that.

715
00:26:48.754 --> 00:26:50.323
Then, three of us...

716
00:26:50.323 --> 00:26:52.224
who grab these first will pass.

717
00:26:52.623 --> 00:26:54.093
The other two will have to compete again.

718
00:26:54.093 --> 00:26:55.164
- A rematch? - Yes.

719
00:26:55.164 --> 00:26:56.764
- Okay, deal. - Put them wherever you want.

720
00:26:56.764 --> 00:26:57.764
- Okay. - Okay.

721
00:26:58.063 --> 00:26:59.063
Where should we put them?

722
00:26:59.063 --> 00:27:00.333
(Ong Niel Hwan are deep in thought.)

723
00:27:00.333 --> 00:27:01.964
We might end up going for one of them.

724
00:27:04.974 --> 00:27:06.573
(Spinning)

725
00:27:08.643 --> 00:27:10.474
My gosh, he looks cool even when he's doing that.

726
00:27:10.914 --> 00:27:12.174
Let's put this one here, then.

727
00:27:12.274 --> 00:27:13.813
(Jae Hwan makes a decision too.)

728
00:27:14.283 --> 00:27:16.613
Seong Woo, let's put one in the middle of the slope.

729
00:27:16.613 --> 00:27:17.654
Let's put one in the middle.

730
00:27:18.113 --> 00:27:19.414
- That will be fun. - Good idea.

731
00:27:19.414 --> 00:27:20.524
It'll be fun.

732
00:27:20.524 --> 00:27:21.783
- Then... - Let's put one in the middle...

733
00:27:21.783 --> 00:27:23.954
- Around here. - No, keep going. Go higher.

734
00:27:23.954 --> 00:27:24.954
(They're taking this so seriously.)

735
00:27:25.454 --> 00:27:26.524
Seong Woo.

736
00:27:26.694 --> 00:27:28.694
(Seong Woo runs up the slope.)

737
00:27:28.694 --> 00:27:30.093
- Stop, right there. - Let's do that.

738
00:27:30.093 --> 00:27:31.234
Seong Woo! Around there.

739
00:27:31.234 --> 00:27:32.434
- That spot is good. - Right there.

740
00:27:32.434 --> 00:27:33.494
- Here? - Yes.

741
00:27:34.464 --> 00:27:36.133
Good! Right there.

742
00:27:37.373 --> 00:27:39.504
- Okay! - Okay.

743
00:27:39.504 --> 00:27:40.643
(Daniel is on the slope too.)

744
00:27:40.974 --> 00:27:42.204
Daniel, what are you doing?

745
00:27:43.073 --> 00:27:44.073
Are you putting yours there?

746
00:27:44.543 --> 00:27:46.613
Hey, I thought you were putting it here.

747
00:27:46.613 --> 00:27:48.283
Everyone will try to grab that one.

748
00:27:48.714 --> 00:27:50.484
How can we get it?

749
00:27:50.954 --> 00:27:53.014
- How can we get it? - If you can't, you have to run up.

750
00:27:53.654 --> 00:27:54.724
You just need to get one.

751
00:27:54.724 --> 00:27:56.123
- This is going to be fun. - Okay.

752
00:27:56.323 --> 00:27:58.754
I am thinking about which one to choose.

753
00:27:58.754 --> 00:28:00.994
You can't stop thinking about which one to choose.

754
00:28:01.323 --> 00:28:03.194
You can't see it well from here.

755
00:28:03.793 --> 00:28:05.664
- Why can't we see anything? - We can't see them.

756
00:28:05.664 --> 00:28:07.133
- Where was it? - I see it.

757
00:28:07.563 --> 00:28:08.664
It's perfect.

758
00:28:08.664 --> 00:28:10.063
- Seong Woo. - Yes?

759
00:28:10.063 --> 00:28:11.974
I want to sit here. Can we play rock-paper-scissors?

760
00:28:11.974 --> 00:28:13.234
You should've come first.

761
00:28:13.234 --> 00:28:14.504
What are you talking about?

762
00:28:14.504 --> 00:28:16.274
- You should've come first. - Do you own this place?

763
00:28:16.274 --> 00:28:17.343
- My goodness. - So why can't I take this spot?

764
00:28:17.343 --> 00:28:19.373
Why are you fighting with a kid?

765
00:28:19.474 --> 00:28:20.783
Rock-paper-scissors.

766
00:28:21.914 --> 00:28:23.014
Go.

767
00:28:25.083 --> 00:28:26.214
Go over there.

768
00:28:26.214 --> 00:28:27.283
(Jeong Soo looks for another spot.)

769
00:28:28.184 --> 00:28:29.684
(He's glad.)

770
00:28:29.853 --> 00:28:31.553
Please. Please.

771
00:28:32.454 --> 00:28:33.593
I have a strategy.

772
00:28:33.964 --> 00:28:35.563
Let's go. I have a strategy.

773
00:28:35.563 --> 00:28:36.724
Me too.

774
00:28:37.093 --> 00:28:38.194
You have a strategy, right?

775
00:28:38.434 --> 00:28:40.164
- Ready. - I am nervous.

776
00:28:40.333 --> 00:28:41.404
Go.

777
00:28:42.633 --> 00:28:43.774
Go.

778
00:28:44.004 --> 00:28:46.234
(They became faster than before.)

779
00:28:46.774 --> 00:28:48.643
(Joong Wan's strategy is to pick up what they miss.)

780
00:28:49.404 --> 00:28:51.174
Slowly. I feel dizzy.

781
00:28:52.043 --> 00:28:54.783
(Jae Hwan and Jeong Soo slide down fast.)

782
00:28:56.313 --> 00:28:58.113
(Who will get the ice cream?)

783
00:28:58.714 --> 00:29:00.754
(Jeong Soo touches it.)

784
00:29:02.954 --> 00:29:04.654
(But he fails to grab it.)

785
00:29:06.994 --> 00:29:08.363
(However,)

786
00:29:08.994 --> 00:29:11.333
(he runs towards another snack without any hesitation.)

787
00:29:12.363 --> 00:29:15.363
(Yoon Jeong Soo survives.)

788
00:29:16.404 --> 00:29:17.904
(Daniel grabs the snack on the left side.)

789
00:29:17.904 --> 00:29:19.004
I got it!

790
00:29:20.573 --> 00:29:22.073
(Daniel is excited.)

791
00:29:23.174 --> 00:29:25.674
(Kang Daniel survives.)

792
00:29:25.974 --> 00:29:27.283
What was your secret?

793
00:29:27.543 --> 00:29:28.813
A man must go straight.

794
00:29:28.883 --> 00:29:30.754
(A man must go straight.)

795
00:29:31.813 --> 00:29:33.514
(The ice cream Jeong Soo missed...)

796
00:29:34.184 --> 00:29:36.283
(is rolling around the snow field.)

797
00:29:37.524 --> 00:29:39.494
(Seong Woo comes later and gets it.)

798
00:29:40.464 --> 00:29:42.323
Hey! Where is it?

799
00:29:43.194 --> 00:29:44.264
Where is it?

800
00:29:45.593 --> 00:29:46.694
Where is it?

801
00:29:47.734 --> 00:29:49.103
(I survived!)

802
00:29:51.004 --> 00:29:52.333
I survived!

803
00:29:53.274 --> 00:29:54.504
I did it!

804
00:29:55.603 --> 00:29:57.174
I got one too.

805
00:29:57.174 --> 00:29:58.313
(Daniel, Seong Woo, and Jeong Soo avoid the penalty.)

806
00:29:58.914 --> 00:30:00.313
I grabbed it so tightly.

807
00:30:00.744 --> 00:30:03.383
I grabbed it so tightly that it burst opened.

808
00:30:05.414 --> 00:30:07.024
Why didn't you come down with us?

809
00:30:07.024 --> 00:30:08.984
I was braking so that I'd go down slower.

810
00:30:09.783 --> 00:30:11.194
It's okay.

811
00:30:11.424 --> 00:30:14.363
You two fools can fight against each other.

812
00:30:14.363 --> 00:30:15.924
(The fools will have a match.)

813
00:30:16.063 --> 00:30:17.194
You have to touch the snack first...

814
00:30:17.533 --> 00:30:19.694
- Touch it? - and then grab the ice cream.

815
00:30:19.694 --> 00:30:22.764
We will put a snow ball in the loser's back.

816
00:30:23.164 --> 00:30:25.033
- Let's go, Jae Hwan. - This is fun.

817
00:30:25.174 --> 00:30:26.303
This is unbelievable.

818
00:30:26.434 --> 00:30:27.643
I am confident to win.

819
00:30:27.643 --> 00:30:29.004
- Are you confident to win? - I am.

820
00:30:29.004 --> 00:30:31.274
- I am confident. - I am confident.

821
00:30:31.543 --> 00:30:32.674
(Laughing)

822
00:30:34.143 --> 00:30:36.313
(Who will be the one to get snow down their shirt?)

823
00:30:36.684 --> 00:30:37.754
You've never showered with snow, have you?

824
00:30:37.754 --> 00:30:38.853
- Showered with snow? - Yes.

825
00:30:38.853 --> 00:30:41.484
- I'll let you experience it today. - What?

826
00:30:41.484 --> 00:30:44.123
I'm trying to make you have good memories.

827
00:30:44.123 --> 00:30:45.254
- You mean the snow shower? - Yes.

828
00:30:45.254 --> 00:30:47.293
- Idiots. - Idiots.

829
00:30:47.623 --> 00:30:49.793
Hurry up, idiots.

830
00:30:49.793 --> 00:30:51.234
(Joong Wan and Jae Hwan will compete.)

831
00:30:51.563 --> 00:30:54.464
Jae Hwan won every time except for this time.

832
00:30:55.464 --> 00:30:56.563
I am going to try my best.

833
00:30:57.033 --> 00:30:58.133
I won't lose.

834
00:30:58.434 --> 00:31:00.343
I am going to bet my life on this.

835
00:31:02.103 --> 00:31:04.573
I thought to myself that I had to win no matter what.

836
00:31:05.744 --> 00:31:08.244
Jae Hwan was very competitive.

837
00:31:08.484 --> 00:31:09.984
And that made me really competitive too.

838
00:31:09.984 --> 00:31:12.684
I didn't care about our age difference. It was a match,

839
00:31:13.014 --> 00:31:14.583
so I had to win.

840
00:31:16.754 --> 00:31:18.694
(They enjoy watching it while eating snacks.)

841
00:31:18.853 --> 00:31:19.954
I am ready.

842
00:31:20.053 --> 00:31:21.793
Ready and go.

843
00:31:24.563 --> 00:31:26.464
(They go over the start line...)

844
00:31:26.464 --> 00:31:28.863
(with a serious face.)

845
00:31:28.863 --> 00:31:30.004
Here I come!

846
00:31:30.004 --> 00:31:32.434
Here I come, Jae Hwan.

847
00:31:33.373 --> 00:31:35.204
(Jae Hwan clenches his fist and slides down.)

848
00:31:35.573 --> 00:31:37.843
(Who will win this contest?)

849
00:31:37.843 --> 00:31:40.113
Joong Wan is going the wrong way.

850
00:31:40.714 --> 00:31:41.714
Hey!

851
00:31:41.714 --> 00:31:43.184
Joong Wan is going the wrong way.

852
00:31:43.684 --> 00:31:44.984
(Jae Hwan screams.)

853
00:31:46.014 --> 00:31:47.254
(Jae Hwan falls.)

854
00:31:48.353 --> 00:31:50.293
(Laughing)

855
00:31:51.853 --> 00:31:54.093
(Jae Hwan faces a crisis.)

856
00:31:55.563 --> 00:31:56.694
How do you do this? Tell me.

857
00:31:56.694 --> 00:31:58.393
(He won the preliminary round,)

858
00:31:58.393 --> 00:31:59.893
(and he was very confident.)

859
00:31:59.994 --> 00:32:01.033
What's the penalty?

860
00:32:01.033 --> 00:32:02.934
(He thought he was never going to lose.)

861
00:32:03.603 --> 00:32:05.434
(So he mentioned the worst penalties.)

862
00:32:07.643 --> 00:32:11.073
(He can't give up just yet.)

863
00:32:12.174 --> 00:32:13.944
(He gets up again...)

864
00:32:15.684 --> 00:32:17.184
(and runs.)

865
00:32:17.184 --> 00:32:18.984
(He runs down the slope...)

866
00:32:20.014 --> 00:32:23.383
(with determination to win.)

867
00:32:25.623 --> 00:32:27.024
(Joong Wan arrives first.)

868
00:32:28.264 --> 00:32:30.123
You did it!

869
00:32:30.123 --> 00:32:32.093
(Why are you right behind me?)

870
00:32:33.593 --> 00:32:35.164
(Jae Hwan ran to redeem himself.)

871
00:32:35.164 --> 00:32:38.674
Jae Hwan! Jae Hwan!

872
00:32:40.444 --> 00:32:41.704
(They slide.)

873
00:32:42.974 --> 00:32:46.343
(They desperately fight for the last ticket to survival.)

874
00:32:46.343 --> 00:32:47.414
They are on the ground. The ice cream.

875
00:32:47.414 --> 00:32:49.143
(Joong Wan...)

876
00:32:49.143 --> 00:32:50.214
(grabs the ice cream.)

877
00:32:50.853 --> 00:32:52.613
(Yook Joon Wan)

878
00:32:53.414 --> 00:32:54.654
(Kim Jae Hwan)

879
00:32:54.654 --> 00:32:55.724
Hey.

880
00:32:57.194 --> 00:32:59.754
(You are the one getting the penalty.)

881
00:33:01.464 --> 00:33:04.393
In every game, the person who suggests the penalty loses.

882
00:33:06.133 --> 00:33:07.764
(They enjoy watching them.)

883
00:33:08.404 --> 00:33:10.004
Let's go make a snow ball.

884
00:33:10.028 --> 00:33:15.028
<font color="#F1E6B2">[VIU Ver] E28 Outrageous Roommates</font>

885
00:33:15.043 --> 00:33:16.343
Why couldn't I grab it?

886
00:33:17.073 --> 00:33:18.744
Why couldn't I grab it?

887
00:33:18.843 --> 00:33:20.043
- Jae Hwan. - Yes.

888
00:33:20.244 --> 00:33:22.313
Isn't it perfect weather to shower with snow?

889
00:33:22.843 --> 00:33:26.783
I fell while sledding down.

890
00:33:26.783 --> 00:33:29.184
You were very greedy.

891
00:33:29.454 --> 00:33:31.494
You lost because you wanted to win.

892
00:33:32.293 --> 00:33:33.994
I won because I was willing to lose.

893
00:33:35.494 --> 00:33:37.264
(The Grim Reapers are waiting.)

894
00:33:38.363 --> 00:33:39.593
(He presses the ball.)

895
00:33:40.633 --> 00:33:42.103
(He's excited.)

896
00:33:42.333 --> 00:33:44.404
I never fell once.

897
00:33:44.404 --> 00:33:45.674
But I fell this time.

898
00:33:45.674 --> 00:33:46.873
- Is that right? - Is that right?

899
00:33:47.143 --> 00:33:48.704
Why did you do that?

900
00:33:48.803 --> 00:33:51.613
I never expected to lose.

901
00:33:51.613 --> 00:33:53.883
The person who suggests the penalty is bound to lose.

902
00:33:53.883 --> 00:33:55.283
(It's the fate of the person who suggests the penalty.)

903
00:33:55.883 --> 00:33:57.484
There's nothing you can do.

904
00:33:57.914 --> 00:33:59.113
- Take off your jacket. - Okay.

905
00:33:59.783 --> 00:34:01.623
- Okay. - Sit down. Sit comfortably.

906
00:34:01.623 --> 00:34:02.684
(The loser has to put a snow ball down his shirt.)

907
00:34:02.883 --> 00:34:04.893
- My goodness. - Sir. As a souvenir,

908
00:34:05.424 --> 00:34:06.853
why don't you hold this up like this?

909
00:34:08.893 --> 00:34:10.393
- Like the Statue of Liberty. - Yes.

910
00:34:10.833 --> 00:34:12.734
If you drop this, we will do it again.

911
00:34:13.663 --> 00:34:16.063
- That's good. - That's good.

912
00:34:16.433 --> 00:34:17.534
You have to give him blessings.

913
00:34:17.534 --> 00:34:19.103
- Okay. - We have to give him blessings.

914
00:34:19.103 --> 00:34:20.703
- Give him blessings first. - Okay.

915
00:34:20.703 --> 00:34:21.944
I will go first.

916
00:34:22.373 --> 00:34:23.574
- Jae Hwan. - Please.

917
00:34:23.574 --> 00:34:24.913
- Jae Hwan. - Yes?

918
00:34:25.243 --> 00:34:28.344
- Ice. - Wait!

919
00:34:28.344 --> 00:34:30.754
- I didn't even begin. - Wait.

920
00:34:30.754 --> 00:34:32.714
Jae...

921
00:34:32.714 --> 00:34:34.054
(He cries like a crow.)

922
00:34:34.154 --> 00:34:35.723
Here.

923
00:34:36.424 --> 00:34:37.853
(The penalty came back to him like a boomerang.)

924
00:34:40.154 --> 00:34:41.424
- Hurry up. - Hurry up and do it.

925
00:34:41.663 --> 00:34:43.194
- Jae Hwan. - Yes.

926
00:34:43.393 --> 00:34:46.293
I hope your voice will get louder in the new year.

927
00:34:46.293 --> 00:34:47.304
(He wishes Jae Hwan's voice will get louder.)

928
00:34:47.304 --> 00:34:48.703
(His voice gets louder.)

929
00:34:51.074 --> 00:34:52.134
It's so cold.

930
00:34:52.134 --> 00:34:55.643
Jae Hwan, it was really nice meeting you.

931
00:34:55.904 --> 00:34:57.013
Look at him.

932
00:34:57.674 --> 00:34:59.873
- What are you doing? - We are teammates.

933
00:34:59.873 --> 00:35:01.444
- Jae Hwan. - We are teammates.

934
00:35:01.813 --> 00:35:03.344
Jae Hwan. Let's...

935
00:35:03.344 --> 00:35:04.654
- Do it. - do better this year.

936
00:35:04.714 --> 00:35:06.453
(The snow explodes inside his clothes.)

937
00:35:08.554 --> 00:35:10.654
I never thought I'd lose.

938
00:35:10.924 --> 00:35:12.223
I realized...

939
00:35:12.424 --> 00:35:16.194
the person who suggests is is supposed to lose.

940
00:35:17.594 --> 00:35:18.964
Let's play.

941
00:35:18.964 --> 00:35:20.194
Let's play.

942
00:35:21.904 --> 00:35:23.034
It's too cold. Hold on.

943
00:35:23.034 --> 00:35:24.103
(They start a snow fight.)

944
00:35:25.373 --> 00:35:28.004
(The game was just an excuse.)

945
00:35:28.004 --> 00:35:29.373
It's too cold.

946
00:35:29.373 --> 00:35:31.373
(He's frozen.)

947
00:35:32.543 --> 00:35:34.013
(Catch me.)

948
00:35:35.484 --> 00:35:38.214
(Don't let me catch you.)

949
00:35:39.254 --> 00:35:41.424
I am so tired.

950
00:35:41.424 --> 00:35:45.094
(Seong Woo tries to pay Joong Wan back.)

951
00:35:45.554 --> 00:35:47.123
Wait. Wait.

952
00:35:47.123 --> 00:35:49.493
(But he ended up getting caught by him instead.)

953
00:35:51.293 --> 00:35:52.734
(He ended up getting...)

954
00:35:52.734 --> 00:35:54.833
(a big chunk of snow in his shirt.)

955
00:35:56.304 --> 00:35:59.103
Joong Wan won't last six months in this industry.

956
00:36:01.004 --> 00:36:02.074
You surprised me.

957
00:36:03.404 --> 00:36:05.313
(Seong Woo lies on the snow field...)

958
00:36:06.574 --> 00:36:08.683
(and enjoys the winter.)

959
00:36:08.784 --> 00:36:10.243
He's dead, isn't he?

960
00:36:11.214 --> 00:36:12.484
Why did you die?

961
00:36:13.353 --> 00:36:14.424
He died?

962
00:36:14.424 --> 00:36:15.453
(He takes a photo of his friend.)

963
00:36:17.594 --> 00:36:20.024
(You can't sleep here.)

964
00:36:20.893 --> 00:36:22.623
I took a nice one. It looks nice.

965
00:36:23.464 --> 00:36:24.634
It looks nice.

966
00:36:25.493 --> 00:36:26.563
Right?

967
00:36:27.933 --> 00:36:31.074
(The 5 men return to their childhood.)

968
00:36:31.074 --> 00:36:32.304
It's so cold.

969
00:36:34.174 --> 00:36:36.873
- I washed my face. - I need tissues.

970
00:36:36.873 --> 00:36:38.543
(The game was just an excuse to play in the snow.)

971
00:36:39.413 --> 00:36:41.043
- Makguksu. - Makguksu.

972
00:36:41.143 --> 00:36:43.143
- Makguksu. - Makguksu.

973
00:36:43.143 --> 00:36:44.953
Makguksu.

974
00:36:45.054 --> 00:36:47.784
We look like we've been doing this for five days.

975
00:36:48.353 --> 00:36:50.623
We look like we haven't been home for five days.

976
00:36:50.723 --> 00:36:51.853
That would be fun...

977
00:36:51.853 --> 00:36:53.393
- to travel for a week. - Yes.

978
00:36:53.393 --> 00:36:54.563
- We can travel around the nation. - Yes.

979
00:36:54.663 --> 00:36:55.763
Makguksu

980
00:36:55.763 --> 00:36:57.734
- Are we going there? - Mak, makguksu

981
00:36:57.893 --> 00:37:00.094
- Gapyeong is famous for dakgalbi. - Dakgalbi

982
00:37:00.094 --> 00:37:01.534
Gapyeong is very famous for dakgalbi.

983
00:37:03.234 --> 00:37:05.774
- I think that will do. - We have dakgalbi and...

984
00:37:06.174 --> 00:37:07.473
We will get a B Set.

985
00:37:07.603 --> 00:37:10.513
We will order a B Set, but please make us happy.

986
00:37:10.813 --> 00:37:12.174
How can he make us happy?

987
00:37:13.313 --> 00:37:14.743
This is such an old-fashioned way.

988
00:37:15.013 --> 00:37:16.714
"Give us 4 servings that looks like 5 servings."

989
00:37:18.583 --> 00:37:19.654
Of course.

990
00:37:19.984 --> 00:37:21.424
- Why are you losing weight? - What?

991
00:37:21.424 --> 00:37:22.623
Why are you losing weight?

992
00:37:23.284 --> 00:37:26.293
- Do I look thinner? - You look nicer when you're fat.

993
00:37:27.924 --> 00:37:29.763
Why can't I get women if I look nice being fat?

994
00:37:29.964 --> 00:37:31.493
"Get women".

995
00:37:32.464 --> 00:37:35.933
All the women said, "You'd look amazing when you lose 5kg."

996
00:37:36.034 --> 00:37:37.973
I lost 13kg, but they're still not calling me.

997
00:37:37.973 --> 00:37:39.404
But I think a middle-aged man...

998
00:37:39.504 --> 00:37:42.344
looks better when you're a little chubby.

999
00:37:42.344 --> 00:37:45.043
When you are thin, you look like you are poor and incompetent.

1000
00:37:45.913 --> 00:37:49.013
I was poor and incompetent for a few years when I was fat.

1001
00:37:49.484 --> 00:37:51.083
My property was seized.

1002
00:37:51.154 --> 00:37:52.484
It's getting sad all of a sudden.

1003
00:37:53.683 --> 00:37:55.583
(His calm words...)

1004
00:37:55.583 --> 00:38:00.924
(make them sad.)

1005
00:38:00.924 --> 00:38:03.694
Then we have nothing to say.

1006
00:38:03.864 --> 00:38:06.763
They're getting better now.

1007
00:38:06.763 --> 00:38:08.703
- They're good at it. - Just overnight.

1008
00:38:08.703 --> 00:38:12.174
Right. You can go on any shows now. I'm very happy.

1009
00:38:12.174 --> 00:38:14.004
- We are trained. - Of course.

1010
00:38:14.344 --> 00:38:16.703
Eat jeonbyeong when it's still hot.

1011
00:38:16.703 --> 00:38:18.114
- Thank you. - Yes.

1012
00:38:18.114 --> 00:38:19.243
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1013
00:38:19.243 --> 00:38:21.614
This is on the house.

1014
00:38:21.614 --> 00:38:22.844
(Tofu kimchi is on the house.)

1015
00:38:23.984 --> 00:38:25.953
Whose fan are you?

1016
00:38:25.953 --> 00:38:26.953
Wanna One?

1017
00:38:26.953 --> 00:38:28.183
(Of course it's Wanna One.)

1018
00:38:28.183 --> 00:38:29.453
Thank you.

1019
00:38:29.453 --> 00:38:30.793
Thank you for the food.

1020
00:38:31.723 --> 00:38:33.493
(It tastes even better after playing hard.)

1021
00:38:33.493 --> 00:38:35.524
This is no joke.

1022
00:38:35.763 --> 00:38:38.333
I've learned it from Kim Jae Hwan. It's no joke.

1023
00:38:41.234 --> 00:38:43.534
(Dakgalbi, the main menu, is finally here.)

1024
00:38:44.933 --> 00:38:46.774
- Oh, it's hot. - I'm sorry.

1025
00:38:46.774 --> 00:38:48.274
(The sauce splashed onto Jeong Soo's hand.)

1026
00:38:48.274 --> 00:38:49.603
He's a junior.

1027
00:38:49.603 --> 00:38:52.643
Oh, it's hot. I can't pay for this.

1028
00:38:52.643 --> 00:38:54.313
(Obnoxious customer Yoon got a chance.)

1029
00:38:54.313 --> 00:38:56.344
Isn't he such a jerk?

1030
00:38:57.083 --> 00:38:59.413
I can't say it straight up.

1031
00:39:02.424 --> 00:39:04.223
(While they were having a fun conversation,)

1032
00:39:04.223 --> 00:39:06.453
(dakgalbi gets ready.)

1033
00:39:06.924 --> 00:39:08.263
Oh, this is how you put it.

1034
00:39:08.263 --> 00:39:10.063
- Is this enough? - Yes, it is.

1035
00:39:10.063 --> 00:39:11.734
Try expressing the taste of dakgalbi.

1036
00:39:11.993 --> 00:39:14.534
- Stop hosting a talk show. - Okay.

1037
00:39:14.534 --> 00:39:16.464
Honestly, I do want to be a host.

1038
00:39:17.004 --> 00:39:19.473
(Daniel has a talent for a variety show.)

1039
00:39:20.134 --> 00:39:21.203
Dakgalbi isn't ready yet.

1040
00:39:21.203 --> 00:39:23.714
Really? I dipped it already. What do I do?

1041
00:39:23.973 --> 00:39:25.643
(It's close to touching him.)

1042
00:39:25.643 --> 00:39:27.043
- Isn't it delicious? - Here I go.

1043
00:39:27.043 --> 00:39:28.683
He knows how to eat it.

1044
00:39:28.743 --> 00:39:32.513
- It tastes better that way. - I think it'll go into his nose.

1045
00:39:33.214 --> 00:39:34.623
It tastes better that way.

1046
00:39:34.623 --> 00:39:35.884
(He finally met cheese.)

1047
00:39:36.024 --> 00:39:38.293
My mouth hurts when I eat like that.

1048
00:39:38.293 --> 00:39:39.393
I need to spin it like this.

1049
00:39:39.393 --> 00:39:40.424
Right.

1050
00:39:40.424 --> 00:39:42.094
It tastes better that way.

1051
00:39:42.094 --> 00:39:44.094
(He's satisfied.)

1052
00:39:45.063 --> 00:39:49.603
(After that, he keeps shoving it in without talking.)

1053
00:39:50.373 --> 00:39:53.743
(Seong Woo's the new rising star of an eating show, threatening Daniel.)

1054
00:39:55.944 --> 00:39:58.674
(He takes a bite too.)

1055
00:39:59.413 --> 00:40:01.643
(He enjoys eating.)

1056
00:40:02.413 --> 00:40:05.313
(Jae Hwan is a quiet but effective eating show professional.)

1057
00:40:06.953 --> 00:40:09.353
(On the other hand, the final boss, Daniel is...)

1058
00:40:12.853 --> 00:40:14.623
(Stretchy)

1059
00:40:15.893 --> 00:40:18.263
(He eats just like Seong Woo.)

1060
00:40:18.263 --> 00:40:19.763
Rather than becoming a regular customer...

1061
00:40:22.563 --> 00:40:23.634
(He succeeded.)

1062
00:40:23.634 --> 00:40:25.274
Do you know salted chicken wings?

1063
00:40:26.433 --> 00:40:28.304
(The skill of the eating show boss...)

1064
00:40:28.304 --> 00:40:31.913
(shines here.)

1065
00:40:33.074 --> 00:40:35.643
(Something's missing.)

1066
00:40:35.944 --> 00:40:38.254
Chicken neck skin is really delicious.

1067
00:40:38.614 --> 00:40:40.824
- Chicken neck is super delicious. - Okay.

1068
00:40:41.254 --> 00:40:42.784
He's going crazy.

1069
00:40:43.384 --> 00:40:44.893
(How is he going to eat it?)

1070
00:40:44.893 --> 00:40:45.993
Can you do it?

1071
00:40:46.293 --> 00:40:47.763
Open your mouth, Daniel.

1072
00:40:49.163 --> 00:40:50.223
Here he goes.

1073
00:40:50.223 --> 00:40:51.333
(He catches it at once.)

1074
00:40:52.734 --> 00:40:54.464
I thought you're worried about your image.

1075
00:40:54.464 --> 00:40:56.134
Not even comedians do that.

1076
00:40:56.603 --> 00:40:58.174
(Seong Woo and Daniel don't care about their images.)

1077
00:40:58.174 --> 00:40:59.473
Comedians don't do this because it's dirty.

1078
00:40:59.473 --> 00:41:01.743
They don't do it if it's seasoned.

1079
00:41:01.944 --> 00:41:03.574
He makes it look really delicious.

1080
00:41:03.603 --> 00:41:04.913
- Open your mouth. - Hurry up and eat.

1081
00:41:06.413 --> 00:41:09.884
I'll give one to Jeong Soo since he suffered the most today.

1082
00:41:11.254 --> 00:41:13.284
Cheese is wrapped nicely.

1083
00:41:13.284 --> 00:41:14.683
(A piece of dakgalbi relieves his fatigue.)

1084
00:41:15.183 --> 00:41:17.254
- I should do it too. - Seong Woo too. Ong Seong Woo.

1085
00:41:17.554 --> 00:41:18.893
Well done today.

1086
00:41:21.393 --> 00:41:22.464
Thank you.

1087
00:41:23.493 --> 00:41:26.393
Dakgalbi and cheese go well, don't they?

1088
00:41:26.393 --> 00:41:28.134
(Jae Hwan quietly grabs lettuce.)

1089
00:41:29.364 --> 00:41:32.304
(A piece of dakgalbi...)

1090
00:41:32.304 --> 00:41:34.643
(and three pieces of garlic?)

1091
00:41:37.574 --> 00:41:39.074
He put something a lot.

1092
00:41:40.313 --> 00:41:42.013
(He added extra garlic.)

1093
00:41:42.484 --> 00:41:45.614
I'd like to give this to Joong Wan.

1094
00:41:45.614 --> 00:41:47.754
- Let me give him my heart. - Sure.

1095
00:41:49.254 --> 00:41:52.094
(He eats it at once without noticing.)

1096
00:41:52.254 --> 00:41:54.763
- How much garlic did you put in? - He put in so much garlic.

1097
00:41:56.964 --> 00:41:58.034
Did you really put in garlic?

1098
00:41:58.034 --> 00:41:59.333
Did you really put in garlic?

1099
00:41:59.594 --> 00:42:00.864
How much did you put in?

1100
00:42:03.134 --> 00:42:06.034
(He shyly sticks out his five fingers.)

1101
00:42:06.034 --> 00:42:07.643
This is the day today.

1102
00:42:09.203 --> 00:42:11.774
(He can't swallow or spit it out.)

1103
00:42:12.913 --> 00:42:14.114
It's pretty spicy.

1104
00:42:14.114 --> 00:42:15.543
Does your nose sting?

1105
00:42:15.543 --> 00:42:17.083
No. My tongue hurts.

1106
00:42:17.083 --> 00:42:18.384
(My tongue hurts.)

1107
00:42:19.384 --> 00:42:20.654
(I can't suffer alone.)

1108
00:42:20.654 --> 00:42:22.723
If you mix rice here now, it's super delicious.

1109
00:42:22.723 --> 00:42:24.924
Excuse me. Do you have chili pepper?

1110
00:42:24.924 --> 00:42:26.424
Can you give me the spiciest one?

1111
00:42:27.063 --> 00:42:28.324
With my love.

1112
00:42:29.263 --> 00:42:30.594
(He's nervous.)

1113
00:42:30.933 --> 00:42:34.563
I'll add the spiciest sauce too.

1114
00:42:35.103 --> 00:42:37.304
- Thank you. - That looks really spicy.

1115
00:42:38.004 --> 00:42:40.674
That looks super spicy.

1116
00:42:41.143 --> 00:42:44.313
- Rather than rock-paper-scissors, - Okay.

1117
00:42:44.344 --> 00:42:46.413
- say a number like 15. - Okay.

1118
00:42:46.413 --> 00:42:49.143
Hold your chopstick and count 1, 2, 3.

1119
00:42:49.813 --> 00:42:52.513
- 1, 2, 3, - Like a game?

1120
00:42:52.513 --> 00:42:54.654
- 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. - Good. That's good.

1121
00:42:54.654 --> 00:42:56.254
And 17. Like this.

1122
00:42:56.254 --> 00:42:58.453
That's amazing. I was going to give this to Jae Hwan.

1123
00:42:58.453 --> 00:43:00.223
- You're safe. - Between 7 and 15.

1124
00:43:00.893 --> 00:43:02.924
- You're safe. - Thank you.

1125
00:43:03.634 --> 00:43:05.134
Between 7 and 15.

1126
00:43:05.594 --> 00:43:06.663
Now...

1127
00:43:07.464 --> 00:43:09.103
1, 2, 3.

1128
00:43:09.103 --> 00:43:11.134
Nine.

1129
00:43:11.534 --> 00:43:12.734
- Now. - We're all pointing at each other.

1130
00:43:12.734 --> 00:43:14.404
One.

1131
00:43:14.674 --> 00:43:16.174
- Hurry up. - Two.

1132
00:43:16.174 --> 00:43:17.844
- 3. - 4.

1133
00:43:17.844 --> 00:43:19.274
- 5. - 6.

1134
00:43:19.274 --> 00:43:20.543
- 7. - 8.

1135
00:43:20.543 --> 00:43:21.643
Nine.

1136
00:43:22.344 --> 00:43:24.614
(He's up for a penalty.)

1137
00:43:25.254 --> 00:43:26.784
(I'm safe.)

1138
00:43:27.424 --> 00:43:29.924
(It's okay as long as it's not me.)

1139
00:43:31.554 --> 00:43:33.594
It's your day today.

1140
00:43:33.623 --> 00:43:35.123
If he tries something...

1141
00:43:35.123 --> 00:43:36.493
If you try something, you get caught.

1142
00:43:36.493 --> 00:43:39.234
- Whoever suggests it gets caught. - Right.

1143
00:43:41.404 --> 00:43:42.864
I just had one.

1144
00:43:43.203 --> 00:43:45.804
I'm very lucky today.

1145
00:43:46.134 --> 00:43:47.543
- I'm eating it instead of you. - That was actually for Jae Hwan.

1146
00:43:47.543 --> 00:43:48.844
(He's still sweating from the wrap he just had.)

1147
00:43:48.844 --> 00:43:50.373
He's sweating already.

1148
00:43:50.743 --> 00:43:52.944
What if I can't talk because my tongue gets snapped?

1149
00:43:54.444 --> 00:43:56.114
What if I can't talk because my tongue gets snapped?

1150
00:43:56.114 --> 00:43:57.484
It's fine. We have many people for a talk here.

1151
00:43:57.484 --> 00:43:58.554
It looks really spicy.

1152
00:43:58.554 --> 00:44:01.183
We have a new host to be. Don't worry.

1153
00:44:01.183 --> 00:44:02.254
That's going to be really spicy.

1154
00:44:02.254 --> 00:44:04.194
- Here it goes. - "Here it goes."

1155
00:44:04.194 --> 00:44:06.393
- Water. Have water ready. - You have to make up your mind.

1156
00:44:06.393 --> 00:44:07.964
(He eats it at once without hesitation.)

1157
00:44:07.964 --> 00:44:10.464
Swallow it. Hurry up.

1158
00:44:12.594 --> 00:44:14.364
(Spicy taste spreads in his mouth rapidly.)

1159
00:44:14.364 --> 00:44:15.833
Malfunctioning.

1160
00:44:16.333 --> 00:44:18.534
(He feels like dying from eating it.)

1161
00:44:18.603 --> 00:44:20.904
He can't even swallow it.

1162
00:44:22.504 --> 00:44:25.373
(He barely completed the penalty.)

1163
00:44:26.043 --> 00:44:27.384
Let's do it one more time.

1164
00:44:27.743 --> 00:44:29.484
(Let's stop now.)

1165
00:44:29.513 --> 00:44:31.183
That was for Jae Hwan.

1166
00:44:31.183 --> 00:44:33.083
That was hilarious, wasn't it?

1167
00:44:33.538 --> 00:44:35.799
Oh, it's makguksu. Awesome.

1168
00:44:36.098 --> 00:44:38.408
- Spicy one. - Is that pine nut powder?

1169
00:44:38.408 --> 00:44:39.808
(Slurping)

1170
00:44:42.638 --> 00:44:44.348
This is Daniel's favorite.

1171
00:44:44.578 --> 00:44:45.708
- Right? - It's really good.

1172
00:44:45.708 --> 00:44:47.578
- It's my favorite. - Right?

1173
00:44:47.578 --> 00:44:48.819
It might be because of pine nuts.

1174
00:44:48.819 --> 00:44:50.618
- Pine nuts and laver. - And peanut powder.

1175
00:44:51.518 --> 00:44:53.859
- Isn't it delicious? - Laver will remind me of you now.

1176
00:44:53.859 --> 00:44:55.089
- It's really good. - Yes.

1177
00:44:55.158 --> 00:44:57.158
- Let's finish it up and leave. - Okay.

1178
00:44:57.158 --> 00:45:00.399
Let's go sleep for about two hours at home.

1179
00:45:00.399 --> 00:45:01.658
- I'm really tired. - Okay.

1180
00:45:01.828 --> 00:45:04.299
(Gyeong Gyu and Sung Kyu visit Sung Kyu's hometown, Jeonju.)

1181
00:45:05.328 --> 00:45:08.969
(They enjoy bibimbap at Sung Kyu's favorite restaurant.)

1182
00:45:09.469 --> 00:45:11.868
(The next destination of Sung Kyu's trip is...)

1183
00:45:12.368 --> 00:45:15.739
(the high school that he went to.)

1184
00:45:17.509 --> 00:45:19.609
This school is clear, isn't it?

1185
00:45:19.609 --> 00:45:21.748
- This is nice. - It's nice.

1186
00:45:22.419 --> 00:45:24.189
It's been a long time since I was here.

1187
00:45:24.319 --> 00:45:25.919
- First time after graduation? - Yes.

1188
00:45:26.649 --> 00:45:29.219
- Did you walk here? - Yes.

1189
00:45:29.219 --> 00:45:30.759
- When you were in high school? - Yes.

1190
00:45:31.428 --> 00:45:33.428
There it is. Chonbuk University.

1191
00:45:33.428 --> 00:45:34.558
Yes. It's over there.

1192
00:45:35.299 --> 00:45:37.268
Chonbuk National...

1193
00:45:37.299 --> 00:45:39.469
- University High School. - I see.

1194
00:45:41.199 --> 00:45:43.268
- Do you remember the paths? - Of course.

1195
00:45:43.268 --> 00:45:45.038
Did anything change or are they the same?

1196
00:45:45.038 --> 00:45:47.208
- The building's still the same. - Is it?

1197
00:45:47.208 --> 00:45:49.808
There were no basketball hoops before.

1198
00:45:49.808 --> 00:45:51.109
That's new.

1199
00:45:51.848 --> 00:45:53.509
Is there class today?

1200
00:45:53.848 --> 00:45:56.348
- They're probably in class. - Are they in class?

1201
00:45:56.578 --> 00:45:57.719
Are they?

1202
00:45:59.018 --> 00:46:00.518
It must've been PE class.

1203
00:46:00.518 --> 00:46:01.958
Oh, PE class.

1204
00:46:02.458 --> 00:46:04.328
- That's the auditorium. - Okay.

1205
00:46:04.328 --> 00:46:05.888
That's the way to the classrooms.

1206
00:46:07.158 --> 00:46:08.498
Doesn't it feel new?

1207
00:46:08.498 --> 00:46:09.498
It does.

1208
00:46:09.958 --> 00:46:11.228
(What is that?)

1209
00:46:13.699 --> 00:46:14.839
They're your juniors.

1210
00:46:14.839 --> 00:46:16.268
- Yes, they are. - Right?

1211
00:46:16.598 --> 00:46:18.669
- They're cheerful. - I was cheerful like them.

1212
00:46:19.339 --> 00:46:21.208
- What? - Right.

1213
00:46:21.339 --> 00:46:23.439
(He's shy, but he's happy.)

1214
00:46:23.848 --> 00:46:25.708
- Hello. - Hello.

1215
00:46:26.978 --> 00:46:28.819
(Gyeong Gyu's proud too.)

1216
00:46:29.978 --> 00:46:31.319
My juniors.

1217
00:46:31.319 --> 00:46:33.319
(Classroom windows are open wide at the appearance of Sung Kyu.)

1218
00:46:33.958 --> 00:46:36.888
(While they're saying hello, the recess is over.)

1219
00:46:38.259 --> 00:46:40.859
I'm sure you were an exemplary student.

1220
00:46:40.859 --> 00:46:42.658
- Me? - I love you.

1221
00:46:42.658 --> 00:46:45.069
I think I was...

1222
00:46:45.069 --> 00:46:46.368
(They say goodbye before the teacher comes in.)

1223
00:46:46.368 --> 00:46:47.439
You know...

1224
00:46:48.939 --> 00:46:51.339
- When I was in high school... - Yes.

1225
00:46:53.239 --> 00:46:54.578
Do you have any special memories?

1226
00:46:54.578 --> 00:46:57.449
I have a lot. When I was in high school...

1227
00:46:58.449 --> 00:47:01.748
There were many students on the bus.

1228
00:47:01.919 --> 00:47:04.788
We were pushed around on the bus.

1229
00:47:04.788 --> 00:47:06.719
While I was on the bus,

1230
00:47:07.219 --> 00:47:08.689
my backpack was switched.

1231
00:47:09.319 --> 00:47:11.658
Was it switched while being pushed?

1232
00:47:11.658 --> 00:47:12.828
On the bus.

1233
00:47:14.098 --> 00:47:18.169
(He takes a look at his school one more time before leaving.)

1234
00:47:19.129 --> 00:47:20.998
- It's nice. - What?

1235
00:47:20.998 --> 00:47:23.098
I know. Did you walk in the back alley too?

1236
00:47:23.098 --> 00:47:24.408
I was here the most.

1237
00:47:24.408 --> 00:47:25.609
Here?

1238
00:47:25.609 --> 00:47:26.879
I walked out of this door...

1239
00:47:26.879 --> 00:47:28.138
- after school. - Of course.

1240
00:47:28.138 --> 00:47:29.339
I used to eat something here.

1241
00:47:29.339 --> 00:47:31.208
- There used to be an arcade. - I see.

1242
00:47:31.748 --> 00:47:33.779
I went there a lot.

1243
00:47:34.649 --> 00:47:37.189
It's worth visiting your old town.

1244
00:47:38.149 --> 00:47:40.689
- Since we visited my school, - Yes.

1245
00:47:40.689 --> 00:47:45.158
there's a famous park that I used to go to when I was young.

1246
00:47:45.658 --> 00:47:47.228
- A park? - Yes. A big park.

1247
00:47:47.259 --> 00:47:48.629
There's a lake too.

1248
00:47:48.728 --> 00:47:49.799
In this cold weather?

1249
00:47:50.268 --> 00:47:51.368
Did you go there with your friends?

1250
00:47:51.368 --> 00:47:53.029
I have good memories there.

1251
00:47:53.029 --> 00:47:54.069
What kind of memories?

1252
00:47:54.199 --> 00:47:57.808
I took a walk with my mother...

1253
00:47:58.109 --> 00:47:59.839
and talked about my future.

1254
00:48:00.169 --> 00:48:01.879
- In Deokjin Park? - Yes.

1255
00:48:01.879 --> 00:48:03.509
- I went there with my mom often. - You did?

1256
00:48:03.509 --> 00:48:04.848
I went there with my friends too.

1257
00:48:05.649 --> 00:48:08.678
That is the most famous park in Jeonju, right?

1258
00:48:08.678 --> 00:48:10.219
Yes, it is.

1259
00:48:10.919 --> 00:48:13.719
In Busan, there is Yongdusan Park.

1260
00:48:13.719 --> 00:48:15.018
- Yongdusan Park? - Yes.

1261
00:48:15.018 --> 00:48:17.629
It is the most famous park in Busan.

1262
00:48:17.629 --> 00:48:21.359
Most teenagers go there with their parents...

1263
00:48:21.359 --> 00:48:23.228
and take pictures.

1264
00:48:23.259 --> 00:48:25.768
- Did you take pictures too? - Sure. In Yongdusan Park.

1265
00:48:25.768 --> 00:48:27.569
Deokjin Park must be a place like that.

1266
00:48:27.569 --> 00:48:28.998
That's right. I think it is.

1267
00:48:29.498 --> 00:48:31.138
- Let's go to Deokjin Park. - Let's go.

1268
00:48:32.969 --> 00:48:36.038
(Full of excitement,)

1269
00:48:37.149 --> 00:48:39.308
(they arrived at the park, but...)

1270
00:48:40.419 --> 00:48:42.919
Gosh. It is snowing a lot.

1271
00:48:44.219 --> 00:48:45.348
We're in Jeonju, right?

1272
00:48:47.558 --> 00:48:49.888
- Is this Deokjin Park? - Yes, it is.

1273
00:48:49.888 --> 00:48:52.558
(They have no idea what's coming.)

1274
00:48:53.859 --> 00:48:57.469
(When they arrived at Jeonju...)

1275
00:48:58.498 --> 00:49:00.439
(and got on the taxi,)

1276
00:49:01.368 --> 00:49:04.569
(they received messages of disaster warning.)

1277
00:49:05.138 --> 00:49:08.408
(Cold temperature and a lot of snow are expected until tomorrow.)

1278
00:49:08.408 --> 00:49:10.208
(Please beware of icy roads and take care of produce.)

1279
00:49:11.779 --> 00:49:13.678
I didn't know that it'd snow.

1280
00:49:16.618 --> 00:49:19.089
(It's not just ordinary snow.)

1281
00:49:20.458 --> 00:49:24.589
(With the cold temperature,)

1282
00:49:25.689 --> 00:49:30.529
(it is snowing heavily, and the wind is blowing hard.)

1283
00:49:31.998 --> 00:49:33.598
(In the heavy snow...)

1284
00:49:33.598 --> 00:49:35.169
- This is nice. - What?

1285
00:49:35.169 --> 00:49:37.739
- Isn't it nice? It's snowing. - It is,

1286
00:49:37.739 --> 00:49:40.208
but I wonder why I should be here in this cold weather...

1287
00:49:40.208 --> 00:49:41.708
and heavy snow.

1288
00:49:41.708 --> 00:49:44.509
The colder it is,

1289
00:49:44.509 --> 00:49:46.649
the more time we should spend outside...

1290
00:49:47.319 --> 00:49:49.779
- and the more active we should be. - Okay.

1291
00:49:49.779 --> 00:49:51.149
I understand that, but...

1292
00:49:53.288 --> 00:49:58.029
For you to walk down your memory lane,

1293
00:49:58.489 --> 00:50:00.399
why should I sacrifice myself like this?

1294
00:50:02.259 --> 00:50:04.469
There is not a single person in Deokjin Park.

1295
00:50:04.629 --> 00:50:06.098
Isn't this like a scene from a movie?

1296
00:50:06.768 --> 00:50:09.638
In this empty park,

1297
00:50:09.638 --> 00:50:10.908
(Only sculptures are welcoming them.)

1298
00:50:10.908 --> 00:50:11.969
there are only two men.

1299
00:50:11.969 --> 00:50:13.879
- Goodness. - This is...

1300
00:50:13.879 --> 00:50:15.339
- I mean... - This is kind of cool.

1301
00:50:15.339 --> 00:50:16.949
Why don't you write a scenario with this?

1302
00:50:16.949 --> 00:50:18.978
(An epic of walking down memory lane in the cold wave)

1303
00:50:18.978 --> 00:50:20.748
It would be great to insert this kind of scene in a movie.

1304
00:50:21.348 --> 00:50:23.348
It's a rare experience to come to an empty park.

1305
00:50:24.618 --> 00:50:27.888
This place reminds you of something, doesn't it?

1306
00:50:27.888 --> 00:50:30.158
- Yes, it does. - But I can't think of anything.

1307
00:50:30.428 --> 00:50:32.658
It doesn't remind me of anything now.

1308
00:50:33.658 --> 00:50:36.098
I'm sure you have something to remember.

1309
00:50:36.098 --> 00:50:38.569
- Look at the bridge. - Why should I?

1310
00:50:38.569 --> 00:50:40.569
And the lake.

1311
00:50:40.569 --> 00:50:41.969
Isn't it beautiful?

1312
00:50:42.699 --> 00:50:44.408
- Goodness. - Swan boats...

1313
00:50:44.408 --> 00:50:45.739
The scenery is amazing.

1314
00:50:45.739 --> 00:50:48.308
No one is riding the swan boats.

1315
00:50:48.308 --> 00:50:49.739
We are going to.

1316
00:50:50.379 --> 00:50:52.408
Why do we have to ride it in this cold weather?

1317
00:50:52.708 --> 00:50:54.348
That is something you should do...

1318
00:50:54.518 --> 00:50:56.178
when you are dating someone...

1319
00:50:56.379 --> 00:50:57.788
- in Jeonju. - It is?

1320
00:50:58.319 --> 00:50:59.989
Every couple rides the swan boats.

1321
00:50:59.989 --> 00:51:02.989
Then ride it with your girlfriend whom you're going to marry.

1322
00:51:02.989 --> 00:51:04.589
Why did you bring me here?

1323
00:51:04.958 --> 00:51:06.158
- There are lotuses. - There are.

1324
00:51:06.629 --> 00:51:08.029
Look at the lotuses.

1325
00:51:08.058 --> 00:51:09.899
They're lotuses.

1326
00:51:09.899 --> 00:51:11.969
They would have been beautiful if they had bloomed.

1327
00:51:11.969 --> 00:51:14.439
- It is a stunning scene. - A stunning scene?

1328
00:51:15.939 --> 00:51:18.169
They look awful now.

1329
00:51:18.169 --> 00:51:19.638
- They all withered. - They're all lotuses.

1330
00:51:19.638 --> 00:51:21.879
- They are all lotuses. - Look over there.

1331
00:51:22.078 --> 00:51:23.109
What?

1332
00:51:23.308 --> 00:51:24.379
- They're ducks. - Ducks.

1333
00:51:24.379 --> 00:51:26.549
The ducks are flipping themselves in this cold weather.

1334
00:51:26.549 --> 00:51:27.618
(The ducks don't care about the cold weather.)

1335
00:51:27.618 --> 00:51:28.779
Look at the two ducks.

1336
00:51:29.779 --> 00:51:30.949
They look like us.

1337
00:51:31.888 --> 00:51:33.558
- That is... - Look. They're flipping themselves.

1338
00:51:33.558 --> 00:51:34.618
(They're eating while flipping their bodies.)

1339
00:51:34.618 --> 00:51:35.689
I think they're eating.

1340
00:51:36.018 --> 00:51:38.629
- They're probably eating fish. - You're right.

1341
00:51:38.958 --> 00:51:40.629
It's a duck show.

1342
00:51:41.428 --> 00:51:44.368
Are the ducks the models of the boats?

1343
00:51:45.029 --> 00:51:46.598
- Right? - Yes. There are many ducks here.

1344
00:51:46.969 --> 00:51:50.569
Is that right? I've never seen lotuses in the winter.

1345
00:51:51.069 --> 00:51:52.439
They're like fallen leaves.

1346
00:51:53.368 --> 00:51:54.439
This is really nice.

1347
00:51:54.439 --> 00:51:55.439
(It's a relief.)

1348
00:51:55.439 --> 00:51:58.708
Did you come here often when you were in high school?

1349
00:51:58.978 --> 00:52:01.449
Yes, I did.

1350
00:52:01.879 --> 00:52:03.549
I also came here often when I was younger...

1351
00:52:03.549 --> 00:52:04.618
- Here? - and when I was 20.

1352
00:52:04.618 --> 00:52:05.689
(Both of them cheer up again and keep walking.)

1353
00:52:05.689 --> 00:52:06.958
Before I went to Seoul.

1354
00:52:08.018 --> 00:52:09.859
How come were you born in such a cold place?

1355
00:52:12.129 --> 00:52:13.228
I don't see anybody.

1356
00:52:13.958 --> 00:52:17.328
There are just the two of us in this park.

1357
00:52:19.498 --> 00:52:20.538
(It's even colder because they are lonely.)

1358
00:52:20.538 --> 00:52:22.739
- Did you cross this bridge a lot? - Sure.

1359
00:52:22.739 --> 00:52:24.169
- Even in cold days? - Yes.

1360
00:52:24.408 --> 00:52:26.339
- Really? - We have another good memory here.

1361
00:52:26.908 --> 00:52:28.779
- Since I came here with you, - With me?

1362
00:52:29.109 --> 00:52:31.348
I got another amazing good memory...

1363
00:52:31.348 --> 00:52:32.449
- in Deokjin Park. - In Deokjin Park?

1364
00:52:33.779 --> 00:52:36.888
On a day when it snows heavily like this...

1365
00:52:36.888 --> 00:52:37.919
(The bridge seems to be endless today.)

1366
00:52:38.489 --> 00:52:42.388
I should stay in a warm room eating grilled sweet potatoes.

1367
00:52:42.388 --> 00:52:43.388
(It takes forever to cross the 260m bridge.)

1368
00:52:43.388 --> 00:52:44.458
For goodness' sake.

1369
00:52:46.029 --> 00:52:47.998
- Why were you born in a cold place? - Wait, Gyeong Gyu.

1370
00:52:47.998 --> 00:52:49.859
- Let's take a picture. - A picture?

1371
00:52:50.129 --> 00:52:51.469
Now that we're here.

1372
00:52:51.469 --> 00:52:55.339
(Taking a picture would even make a crying baby stop like magic.)

1373
00:52:55.339 --> 00:52:58.208
1, 2, 3.

1374
00:52:59.208 --> 00:53:03.408
(It looks like they are really happy now.)

1375
00:53:04.908 --> 00:53:07.379
(Taking a picture is fine,)

1376
00:53:07.379 --> 00:53:08.618
Hey...

1377
00:53:08.618 --> 00:53:09.978
(but this walk seems to be endless.)

1378
00:53:09.978 --> 00:53:10.989
Gosh.

1379
00:53:11.848 --> 00:53:13.719
My goodness.

1380
00:53:14.558 --> 00:53:16.859
- I... - Look at that.

1381
00:53:17.589 --> 00:53:18.958
We're having a snowstorm.

1382
00:53:19.259 --> 00:53:20.598
You can't easily experience...

1383
00:53:20.828 --> 00:53:22.699
- something like this in your life. - What?

1384
00:53:23.259 --> 00:53:25.768
- I wonder... - It's picturesque.

1385
00:53:26.629 --> 00:53:28.799
why I came to Jeonju with you.

1386
00:53:28.868 --> 00:53:30.638
- It is like a piece of art. - What?

1387
00:53:30.638 --> 00:53:31.638
Indeed.

1388
00:53:32.839 --> 00:53:33.908
It is wonderful.

1389
00:53:33.908 --> 00:53:35.138
(The temperatures of the two men are so different.)

1390
00:53:35.538 --> 00:53:39.649
I will never forget Deokjin Park.

1391
00:53:39.779 --> 00:53:42.219
- It is really picturesque. - All right.

1392
00:53:42.219 --> 00:53:46.149
Deokjin Park... After eating only a bowl of bibimbap...

1393
00:53:46.449 --> 00:53:47.888
It is too cold...

1394
00:53:48.458 --> 00:53:49.589
in Deokjin Park.

1395
00:53:50.529 --> 00:53:52.589
When you go fishing, sometimes the weather is...

1396
00:53:52.589 --> 00:53:54.029
- I don't in such a weather. - You don't?

1397
00:53:54.259 --> 00:53:57.129
I never fish in cold weather.

1398
00:53:58.328 --> 00:54:00.768
If you go fishing despite the weather,

1399
00:54:00.768 --> 00:54:02.498
don't you feel a sense of accomplishment?

1400
00:54:02.498 --> 00:54:03.839
- Yes. I admit it. - Right?

1401
00:54:05.138 --> 00:54:06.308
I think there are...

1402
00:54:06.308 --> 00:54:07.638
(Even though they complain about the blizzard...)

1403
00:54:07.638 --> 00:54:09.638
many fish in there, right?

1404
00:54:10.549 --> 00:54:13.649
There must be many carps. What?

1405
00:54:13.649 --> 00:54:15.178
People fish in the lake too, don't they?

1406
00:54:15.178 --> 00:54:16.219
Of course they do.

1407
00:54:16.848 --> 00:54:18.419
You'll catch them as soon as you put your fishing rod.

1408
00:54:18.419 --> 00:54:19.489
(They don't give up and keep going.)

1409
00:54:20.049 --> 00:54:23.359
(They finished crossing Yeonhwa Bridge in the end.)

1410
00:54:23.629 --> 00:54:25.428
- Sung Kyu. - It is really magnificent.

1411
00:54:26.189 --> 00:54:28.129
- It is magnificent, isn't it? - Yes, it is.

1412
00:54:29.428 --> 00:54:31.498
- It is magnificent. - The snow, the lake,

1413
00:54:31.828 --> 00:54:32.868
and the bridge...

1414
00:54:33.228 --> 00:54:35.538
Did it also snow like this when you were in high school?

1415
00:54:35.538 --> 00:54:37.908
It is your first time to have snow in Deokjin Park, isn't it?

1416
00:54:37.908 --> 00:54:39.569
I wouldn't have come here if it had snowed.

1417
00:54:41.638 --> 00:54:43.708
Hey, Deokjin Park...

1418
00:54:43.779 --> 00:54:46.808
In order for us to have more precious memory,

1419
00:54:47.219 --> 00:54:50.248
the weather kind of blessed us.

1420
00:54:50.248 --> 00:54:51.649
- For us to shoot great scenes. - Right.

1421
00:54:52.618 --> 00:54:55.319
(He is so much blessed that he gets teary.)

1422
00:54:57.689 --> 00:55:00.629
People might misunderstand if they watch this show on TV later.

1423
00:55:00.629 --> 00:55:02.458
They would think we were in Siberia or something.

1424
00:55:03.629 --> 00:55:04.998
But this is Jeonju in Jeolla Province.

1425
00:55:04.998 --> 00:55:06.998
People who just started to watch this show would think,

1426
00:55:06.998 --> 00:55:08.638
"What is that? Is that Siberia?"

1427
00:55:08.638 --> 00:55:09.638
"Is that the Antarctic or what?"

1428
00:55:09.638 --> 00:55:11.638
"Why are they there in the winter? Where exactly are they?"

1429
00:55:13.109 --> 00:55:14.109
We're in Jeonju.

1430
00:55:14.109 --> 00:55:15.138
(Welcome to Jeonju.)

1431
00:55:15.138 --> 00:55:18.478
We don't usually expect to have snow in Jeonju, right?

1432
00:55:18.478 --> 00:55:19.478
Right.

1433
00:55:19.678 --> 00:55:21.848
- In fact... - We do in Gangwon Province,

1434
00:55:21.848 --> 00:55:24.888
but we get to expect something cultural in Jeonju.

1435
00:55:25.319 --> 00:55:28.158
Hanok Village! We should go there.

1436
00:55:28.158 --> 00:55:30.629
There was no Hanok Village when I lived here. I don't have a memory.

1437
00:55:30.629 --> 00:55:31.629
- Really? - Yes.

1438
00:55:31.689 --> 00:55:33.998
It was not built up when I was young.

1439
00:55:33.998 --> 00:55:35.399
It was not?

1440
00:55:35.399 --> 00:55:36.529
What about Deokjin Park?

1441
00:55:36.828 --> 00:55:37.868
This was built long ago.

1442
00:55:37.868 --> 00:55:39.629
It was? Were there swan boats back then too?

1443
00:55:39.699 --> 00:55:40.768
Yes, there were.

1444
00:55:40.768 --> 00:55:41.839
- The swan boats? - Yes.

1445
00:55:41.839 --> 00:55:42.868
(Sung Kyu wants to ride it even in the cold weather.)

1446
00:55:43.368 --> 00:55:46.069
(Gyeong Gyu doesn't want to because it's too cold.)

1447
00:55:46.708 --> 00:55:49.038
Can we ride it today, sir?

1448
00:55:49.308 --> 00:55:50.649
- Yes. Welcome. - We can?

1449
00:55:50.649 --> 00:55:51.678
Sorry?

1450
00:55:52.248 --> 00:55:53.848
We can even in this cold weather?

1451
00:55:54.649 --> 00:55:56.248
- If the customers want to. - Pardon?

1452
00:55:56.248 --> 00:55:57.348
If the customers want to.

1453
00:55:57.348 --> 00:55:58.489
Of course we want to.

1454
00:55:58.489 --> 00:55:59.788
For a safety reason...

1455
00:56:00.859 --> 00:56:03.189
- There are life vests. - This way, please.

1456
00:56:03.189 --> 00:56:06.158
Life vests? But there's a snowstorm.

1457
00:56:07.328 --> 00:56:08.928
I have to put my bag somewhere.

1458
00:56:08.928 --> 00:56:09.928
(Gyeong Gyu wants to escape from there,)

1459
00:56:11.169 --> 00:56:13.868
(but Sung Kyu slowly approaches him...)

1460
00:56:15.199 --> 00:56:18.868
(and helps Gyeong Gyu put on the life vest.)

1461
00:56:19.538 --> 00:56:21.708
(Sighing)

1462
00:56:22.908 --> 00:56:23.949
Wait.

1463
00:56:23.949 --> 00:56:25.549
(They put on the life vests side by side...)

1464
00:56:27.419 --> 00:56:29.919
(and head for the dock.)

1465
00:56:31.089 --> 00:56:33.219
Have you ever ridden it or not?

1466
00:56:33.658 --> 00:56:35.458
- When? - When you came here.

1467
00:56:35.458 --> 00:56:37.228
When I was young? Sure, I did.

1468
00:56:37.359 --> 00:56:38.689
- What? - I rode it when I was young.

1469
00:56:39.658 --> 00:56:41.629
Don't you want to ride it as soon as you see it?

1470
00:56:41.728 --> 00:56:43.259
Don't you want to rush onto it?

1471
00:56:44.629 --> 00:56:45.768
In this heavy snow?

1472
00:56:46.998 --> 00:56:49.638
Sir, is it really okay to ride it in this snow?

1473
00:56:49.638 --> 00:56:52.368
Yes. Some people even ride it after breaking ice.

1474
00:56:52.368 --> 00:56:54.638
Even after breaking ice? But there is no ice now.

1475
00:56:54.638 --> 00:56:55.708
- There is no ice now. - Right.

1476
00:56:55.708 --> 00:56:56.739
Is it that much fun?

1477
00:56:57.248 --> 00:56:58.879
I'm asking you if this is that much fun.

1478
00:56:59.649 --> 00:57:01.518
- Try to work on the pedal hard. - What?

1479
00:57:01.518 --> 00:57:03.919
- He said to pedal hard. - I asked if it's fun.

1480
00:57:04.719 --> 00:57:06.788
Is it? It's not that fun, right?

1481
00:57:06.788 --> 00:57:08.189
(I really don't want to ride it.)

1482
00:57:08.589 --> 00:57:09.658
I can't believe we're doing this here.

1483
00:57:09.658 --> 00:57:10.689
(Let's ride it together and share a good memory.)

1484
00:57:10.689 --> 00:57:12.888
I don't know what we're doing now.

1485
00:57:12.888 --> 00:57:14.199
Now that we're already here, we should ride it.

1486
00:57:15.558 --> 00:57:16.558
Well...

1487
00:57:16.558 --> 00:57:18.399
If you think about it deeply, it is quite awesome.

1488
00:57:18.799 --> 00:57:21.739
- Only two of us are in the lake. - Okay.

1489
00:57:22.669 --> 00:57:24.868
Why can't I see any lotus flowers?

1490
00:57:24.868 --> 00:57:26.569
(Sung Kyu gets in first.)

1491
00:57:27.078 --> 00:57:28.439
How come there are no other customers?

1492
00:57:29.708 --> 00:57:30.779
Gyeong Gyu.

1493
00:57:30.779 --> 00:57:31.848
(I'm here, Gyeong Gyu.)

1494
00:57:31.848 --> 00:57:32.908
Please sit down here.

1495
00:57:32.949 --> 00:57:33.949
Things are tough in this park.

1496
00:57:33.949 --> 00:57:34.949
(Gyeong Gyu reluctantly gets in too.)

1497
00:57:34.949 --> 00:57:36.149
This is...

1498
00:57:37.618 --> 00:57:40.288
(They're waiting for the departure.)

1499
00:57:41.058 --> 00:57:43.219
(Whispering)

1500
00:57:43.859 --> 00:57:45.629
(Laughing)

1501
00:57:46.689 --> 00:57:49.498
- No, that was just between us. - Sorry?

1502
00:57:49.958 --> 00:57:51.828
Pardon? What did you say?

1503
00:57:51.828 --> 00:57:54.699
He whispered this to me.

1504
00:57:55.098 --> 00:57:56.669
"Why are you riding it? It's freezing today."

1505
00:57:57.669 --> 00:57:59.708
Do you usually open this time of year?

1506
00:57:59.708 --> 00:58:00.779
Yes.

1507
00:58:00.939 --> 00:58:02.308
- Even when it's freezing? - Yes.

1508
00:58:02.308 --> 00:58:04.208
Did you have customers today?

1509
00:58:04.808 --> 00:58:06.009
No, not yet.

1510
00:58:07.118 --> 00:58:10.018
- Are we your first customers today? - I told you so.

1511
00:58:10.178 --> 00:58:12.388
But that's meaningful in its own way, isn't it?

1512
00:58:12.649 --> 00:58:14.458
- Meaningful, my foot. - I guess so.

1513
00:58:14.888 --> 00:58:15.989
This is unbelievable.

1514
00:58:16.259 --> 00:58:17.529
We're off now.

1515
00:58:18.928 --> 00:58:21.098
(The first sawn boat departs at last.)

1516
00:58:23.129 --> 00:58:24.728
(Feeling nervous)

1517
00:58:25.228 --> 00:58:26.399
Go easy on paddling.

1518
00:58:26.399 --> 00:58:27.469
(Can they ride this boat?)

1519
00:58:27.469 --> 00:58:30.098
My gosh, the view is spectacular.

1520
00:58:32.009 --> 00:58:34.478
(Paddling)

1521
00:58:34.478 --> 00:58:35.509
Hey.

1522
00:58:35.779 --> 00:58:36.908
The wind.

1523
00:58:37.149 --> 00:58:40.419
The wind is coming from opposite directions, so it's not moving.

1524
00:58:42.549 --> 00:58:43.949
Gosh, it's cold.

1525
00:58:45.018 --> 00:58:46.089
It's freezing cold.

1526
00:58:50.118 --> 00:58:53.328
Hey, go easy on that paddle.

1527
00:58:53.328 --> 00:58:54.529
Stop that.

1528
00:58:57.169 --> 00:59:01.138
I bet we are the only ones riding a boat in a weather like this.

1529
00:59:01.138 --> 00:59:02.699
This swan boat...

1530
00:59:02.699 --> 00:59:03.768
(It's for couples and families.)

1531
00:59:03.768 --> 00:59:05.339
is for couples to ride.

1532
00:59:05.339 --> 00:59:07.308
Or you ride it with your parents...

1533
00:59:08.339 --> 00:59:11.149
- or your kids. - We are almost a family.

1534
00:59:11.149 --> 00:59:12.379
But still. Gosh.

1535
00:59:14.279 --> 00:59:16.149
I only had good memories in Jeonju.

1536
00:59:16.149 --> 00:59:17.348
(He only had good memories until now.)

1537
00:59:17.388 --> 00:59:21.589
Seriously. All my memories in Jeonju were great.

1538
00:59:22.118 --> 00:59:23.158
Jeonju...

1539
00:59:23.158 --> 00:59:26.089
- You made another great memory. - Why am I in this trouble?

1540
00:59:29.598 --> 00:59:31.098
It's just like that life lesson.

1541
00:59:31.199 --> 00:59:33.699
You must be careful of the people you keep around.

1542
00:59:33.699 --> 00:59:35.098
(He's reminded of the truth about life in the boat.)

1543
00:59:37.739 --> 00:59:39.239
- What's wrong? - I'm cold.

1544
00:59:39.239 --> 00:59:40.379
It's cold today.

1545
00:59:40.379 --> 00:59:41.779
- It's windy too. - Sorry?

1546
00:59:41.779 --> 00:59:43.848
- It's windy today. - Yes, indeed.

1547
00:59:43.949 --> 00:59:45.248
The boat isn't moving forward either...

1548
00:59:45.708 --> 00:59:46.919
because of the wind.

1549
00:59:46.919 --> 00:59:47.978
(They wish this was just a dream.)

1550
00:59:50.489 --> 00:59:52.919
(Gyeong Gyu and Sung Kyu try to pluck up their spirits.)

1551
00:59:52.919 --> 00:59:54.719
Hey, that's Chonbuk University over there.

1552
00:59:55.089 --> 00:59:56.719
Yes, it's right next to the university.

1553
00:59:56.719 --> 00:59:57.828
- Is that so? - Yes.

1554
00:59:58.928 --> 01:00:00.828
That one is the high school you attended, correct?

1555
01:00:01.199 --> 01:00:03.699
- No, my school is on that side. - The park is between them.

1556
01:00:04.029 --> 01:00:05.699
So I used to come here often after school with my friends.

1557
01:00:05.699 --> 01:00:08.038
- This must be an old park. - Yes, it is.

1558
01:00:08.038 --> 01:00:10.408
It is, isn't it? It looks like it's been here for hundreds of years.

1559
01:00:10.408 --> 01:00:11.939
- Hundreds of years? - Yes.

1560
01:00:12.969 --> 01:00:15.839
(Their 5 minutes feel like hundreds of years.)

1561
01:00:16.578 --> 01:00:18.908
This is enough, right? It's enough to give you a memory, right?

1562
01:00:18.908 --> 01:00:20.978
- Yes, this is nice. - It's great.

1563
01:00:20.978 --> 01:00:22.518
- We made a precious memory. - Right.

1564
01:00:23.819 --> 01:00:26.449
(The boat returns with full of memories within 5 minutes.)

1565
01:00:26.449 --> 01:00:27.919
(Why are they back already?)

1566
01:00:27.919 --> 01:00:32.089
Sir, for how long do people usually ride this boat?

1567
01:00:32.388 --> 01:00:33.658
- About 50 minutes. - Sorry?

1568
01:00:33.658 --> 01:00:34.759
They ride no more than 50 minutes.

1569
01:00:34.759 --> 01:00:36.029
- No more than 50 minutes? - 50 minutes?

1570
01:00:36.029 --> 01:00:37.998
(They repeat after him at the same time.)

1571
01:00:40.299 --> 01:00:41.998
People ride this for 45 minutes?

1572
01:00:41.998 --> 01:00:44.638
(5 minutes were hard enough, but they ride this for that long?)

1573
01:00:48.908 --> 01:00:50.009
This is fun.

1574
01:00:51.578 --> 01:00:53.478
I'm having a blast.

1575
01:00:54.178 --> 01:00:57.689
My gosh, this is... Why do people ride this?

1576
01:00:58.449 --> 01:00:59.549
It's the best.

1577
01:00:59.549 --> 01:01:00.658
(The swan boat is the best.)

1578
01:01:01.018 --> 01:01:02.589
My gosh, it was fun.

1579
01:01:03.958 --> 01:01:05.228
- Sung Kyu. - Yes?

1580
01:01:05.228 --> 01:01:07.058
- It was fun. - Wasn't it fun?

1581
01:01:07.058 --> 01:01:08.359
(Then you should ride it a bit longer.)

1582
01:01:10.799 --> 01:01:13.228
- Snowing stopped when we got off. - Yes, it did.

1583
01:01:16.799 --> 01:01:18.339
Let's get out of Deokjin Park.

1584
01:01:18.339 --> 01:01:19.408
(Forget about the snow.)

1585
01:01:19.408 --> 01:01:20.779
- Sung Kyu. - Yes?

1586
01:01:20.779 --> 01:01:22.308
Let's get out of Deokjin Park.

1587
01:01:23.279 --> 01:01:24.348
Okay.

1588
01:01:24.478 --> 01:01:25.578
- Thank you. - Sir.

1589
01:01:25.908 --> 01:01:27.578
- We had a great time here. - Don't be stubborn,

1590
01:01:28.279 --> 01:01:30.078
and close your shop on a cold day like this.

1591
01:01:30.949 --> 01:01:32.518
You should call it a day. It's freezing today.

1592
01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:34.618
Bye.

1593
01:01:34.618 --> 01:01:36.058
(Bye, Deokjin Park.)

1594
01:01:39.259 --> 01:01:40.598
(It starts snowing again when they leave the park.)

1595
01:01:40.598 --> 01:01:41.658
Well...

1596
01:01:43.969 --> 01:01:45.299
Can't we take the train ride back?

1597
01:01:45.299 --> 01:01:46.828
- Right now? - Yes.

1598
01:01:46.828 --> 01:01:48.199
Let's drink something hot first.

1599
01:01:48.799 --> 01:01:50.239
- Let's get some coffee. - Let's think it over.

1600
01:01:50.239 --> 01:01:51.308
Okay.

1601
01:01:51.808 --> 01:01:53.708
- It's warm in here. - This is nice.

1602
01:01:53.808 --> 01:01:55.178
Indoor is the way to go during winter.

1603
01:01:55.578 --> 01:01:57.908
- Thank you for bringing it here. - Right.

1604
01:01:57.908 --> 01:01:59.408
- Please enjoy. - Thank you.

1605
01:02:00.978 --> 01:02:02.118
(Reaching)

1606
01:02:04.189 --> 01:02:06.089
(He wasn't giving that to me?)

1607
01:02:07.359 --> 01:02:10.689
(You went through a lot of trouble to get us on the swan boat.)

1608
01:02:13.759 --> 01:02:14.859
I knew it.

1609
01:02:14.899 --> 01:02:16.399
- Thank you. - Enjoy.

1610
01:02:17.629 --> 01:02:20.569
(He takes a sip of the coffee after teasing Sung Kyu.)

1611
01:02:20.569 --> 01:02:22.169
My gosh, it's good.

1612
01:02:23.399 --> 01:02:25.469
Why would I be in Jeonju on a snowy day like today...

1613
01:02:25.469 --> 01:02:27.408
- if it weren't for you? - I know.

1614
01:02:27.638 --> 01:02:29.879
- It's part of our memory. - I'm grateful for it.

1615
01:02:30.138 --> 01:02:31.649
I'm sure you will think...

1616
01:02:31.879 --> 01:02:34.549
about this moment some day in the future.

1617
01:02:35.348 --> 01:02:37.118
Be honest. How many times have you been to the park?

1618
01:02:38.219 --> 01:02:39.348
About five times?

1619
01:02:39.649 --> 01:02:42.259
Do you have a photo of you and your father at the park?

1620
01:02:42.489 --> 01:02:44.129
- Or with your mother? - I never took one with my family,

1621
01:02:44.129 --> 01:02:45.529
but I've been here.

1622
01:02:47.129 --> 01:02:48.259
I...

1623
01:02:49.699 --> 01:02:50.728
- I... - Do you have photos?

1624
01:02:50.728 --> 01:02:51.969
I have those photos.

1625
01:02:51.969 --> 01:02:53.768
Photos at Yongdusan Park in Busan.

1626
01:02:55.368 --> 01:02:57.439
- That's my father. - I see.

1627
01:02:57.939 --> 01:02:59.368
That's my dad.

1628
01:02:59.538 --> 01:03:00.678
He passed away.

1629
01:03:01.538 --> 01:03:02.678
And this.

1630
01:03:02.678 --> 01:03:04.808
- Who is that? - It's my brother. This is me.

1631
01:03:05.578 --> 01:03:07.319
- It was when I was 5. - You were 5?

1632
01:03:07.319 --> 01:03:08.419
I look angry back then too.

1633
01:03:08.649 --> 01:03:10.489
I guess that never changes.

1634
01:03:10.748 --> 01:03:14.558
I have memories at this place.

1635
01:03:14.658 --> 01:03:16.618
But you don't have photos at the park?

1636
01:03:17.859 --> 01:03:21.458
I do believe that taking photos is meaningful,

1637
01:03:21.859 --> 01:03:23.828
but I think it's more meaningful...

1638
01:03:23.828 --> 01:03:26.228
to etch the view in my eyes as well as my heart.

1639
01:03:26.228 --> 01:03:27.399
- Is that so? - Yes.

1640
01:03:28.768 --> 01:03:31.169
- Do you have a lot of friends here? - I have tons of friends here.

1641
01:03:31.169 --> 01:03:33.578
- Really? - Should I call my friend...

1642
01:03:33.578 --> 01:03:35.578
and use my friend as a guide in Jeonju?

1643
01:03:36.279 --> 01:03:37.678
An elementary school friend? Or high school friend?

1644
01:03:37.678 --> 01:03:39.609
He and I lived in the same area. I knew him since middle school.

1645
01:03:40.319 --> 01:03:41.478
Is your friend married?

1646
01:03:41.649 --> 01:03:42.748
No, no.

1647
01:03:43.279 --> 01:03:45.618
It's hard to meet up with my friends when they get married.

1648
01:03:46.219 --> 01:03:47.219
That's bound to happen.

1649
01:03:47.219 --> 01:03:48.888
Especially when they have children.

1650
01:03:48.888 --> 01:03:52.228
Some of my friends got divorced.

1651
01:03:53.699 --> 01:03:54.928
Some are separated too.

1652
01:03:54.928 --> 01:03:56.529
(He's telling Sung Kyu all sorts of things.)

1653
01:03:57.998 --> 01:04:01.839
As I get older, there are various kinds of changes around me.

1654
01:04:03.069 --> 01:04:04.308
I guess aging can't be stopped.

1655
01:04:04.308 --> 01:04:05.669
(Getting old can't be prevented.)

1656
01:04:06.038 --> 01:04:07.308
Seriously.

1657
01:04:08.408 --> 01:04:10.038
Truth be told, some of my friends aren't with us anymore.

1658
01:04:10.949 --> 01:04:13.178
I see. That's inevitable.

1659
01:04:13.178 --> 01:04:14.348
Some are dead.

1660
01:04:15.319 --> 01:04:19.549
You will experience many changes by provision of the nature.

1661
01:04:20.149 --> 01:04:21.589
There is no time like the present.

1662
01:04:24.058 --> 01:04:25.629
Present is always the best time of our life.

1663
01:04:25.629 --> 01:04:27.928
(Present is always the best time of our life.)

1664
01:04:27.928 --> 01:04:29.428
- Always. - I always believe...

1665
01:04:29.498 --> 01:04:31.399
that present is the best time of my life.

1666
01:04:34.199 --> 01:04:36.098
You think there aren't that many things to do at my age, right?

1667
01:04:37.638 --> 01:04:39.868
When I was young, I assumed...

1668
01:04:40.009 --> 01:04:42.239
that the older men had nothing else going on in life.

1669
01:04:42.638 --> 01:04:43.708
I was wrong.

1670
01:04:44.549 --> 01:04:47.949
As you get older, your desire to try new things doesn't disappear.

1671
01:04:48.819 --> 01:04:50.348
You still want to try new things?

1672
01:04:50.449 --> 01:04:53.219
Of course. Every age has its own goal.

1673
01:04:54.518 --> 01:04:56.319
Do you still want to try out various things?

1674
01:04:56.819 --> 01:04:57.859
Yes.

1675
01:04:58.558 --> 01:05:00.598
- Why were you mad about the boat? - My gosh.

1676
01:05:00.699 --> 01:05:03.428
Riding the swan boat doesn't suit the situation we are in.

1677
01:05:04.669 --> 01:05:06.399
Who rides the boat at my age?

1678
01:05:07.739 --> 01:05:10.038
But then you said...

1679
01:05:10.138 --> 01:05:11.439
- What? - It's not that.

1680
01:05:11.439 --> 01:05:14.779
Who rides the swan boat on a snowy day at my age?

1681
01:05:14.879 --> 01:05:17.779
- But you wanted to do new things. - That's irrelevant.

1682
01:05:18.248 --> 01:05:20.678
- Is there anything you want to try? - No, there isn't.

1683
01:05:21.319 --> 01:05:24.419
But didn't you tell me that people at your age want to try many things?

1684
01:05:25.649 --> 01:05:27.058
(I take it back.)

1685
01:05:27.058 --> 01:05:28.989
You were serious when you told me that...

1686
01:05:28.989 --> 01:05:30.529
age didn't influence your will to try new things.

1687
01:05:30.989 --> 01:05:33.598
When you get old, you start changing your opinions quickly.

1688
01:05:34.259 --> 01:05:37.498
And you have extreme mood swings. You have ups and downs.

1689
01:05:37.498 --> 01:05:39.969
- Did you have one just now then? - We have mood swings.

1690
01:05:39.969 --> 01:05:41.638
- Without anyone noticing? - It happens when you get old.

1691
01:05:42.299 --> 01:05:43.808
I have ups and downs.

1692
01:05:45.339 --> 01:05:46.469
Did that happen today too?

1693
01:05:46.879 --> 01:05:48.009
It happened about two times.

1694
01:05:49.408 --> 01:05:52.208
I was so happy at one point,

1695
01:05:52.509 --> 01:05:54.219
and I felt so unfortunate next.

1696
01:05:54.978 --> 01:05:56.279
Then what do you do to lighten up the mood?

1697
01:05:57.189 --> 01:06:00.288
I call my close friends or junior comedians...

1698
01:06:00.419 --> 01:06:01.489
and vent.

1699
01:06:04.428 --> 01:06:06.158
- Guess whom I usually call. - Lee Yoon Seok.

1700
01:06:06.158 --> 01:06:07.228
That's right.

1701
01:06:08.029 --> 01:06:10.868
He listens to me perpetually. You must learn that from him.

1702
01:06:11.399 --> 01:06:13.969
- He doesn't share his opinions. - Not at all.

1703
01:06:14.669 --> 01:06:15.998
He only listens to what I say.

1704
01:06:17.939 --> 01:06:19.109
This is how he looks.

1705
01:06:19.109 --> 01:06:20.239
(This is how you do it. Watch.)

1706
01:06:20.939 --> 01:06:23.439
(He's the model example of a loyal friend.)

1707
01:06:23.848 --> 01:06:26.578
In that sense, I like you.

1708
01:06:26.678 --> 01:06:28.078
- Who are you talking about? - You.

1709
01:06:29.379 --> 01:06:31.518
You don't dig deep when you ask questions.

1710
01:06:32.949 --> 01:06:34.788
(Gyeong Gyu, it's just that...)

1711
01:06:35.489 --> 01:06:37.589
(You'll also be my loyal friend, right?)

1712
01:06:38.788 --> 01:06:40.228
Actually, it's because I'm not interested.

1713
01:06:40.259 --> 01:06:41.328
(He's not interested in others.)

1714
01:06:41.699 --> 01:06:43.129
Actually, it's because I'm not interested.

1715
01:06:43.158 --> 01:06:45.228
(He's shocked.)

1716
01:06:46.629 --> 01:06:48.239
(He's rejected as soon as he makes his confession.)

1717
01:06:49.498 --> 01:06:51.868
(I miss Yoon Seok.)

1718
01:06:52.509 --> 01:06:53.578
Okay.

1719
01:06:54.308 --> 01:06:56.339
(I was just joking.)

1720
01:06:56.439 --> 01:06:57.678
- Hey. - Yes?

1721
01:06:58.049 --> 01:07:00.009
- You know your debut song? - Yes.

1722
01:07:00.219 --> 01:07:01.279
- It's... - "Come Back Again".

1723
01:07:01.279 --> 01:07:02.978
It's "Come Back Again"? Then what about "You're Mine"?

1724
01:07:03.549 --> 01:07:05.288
- You mean, "Be Mine"? - "Be Mine".

1725
01:07:07.118 --> 01:07:08.259
"You're Mine".

1726
01:07:09.058 --> 01:07:10.388
- "Be Mine". - Okay.

1727
01:07:10.589 --> 01:07:11.859
Actually, I...

1728
01:07:12.129 --> 01:07:14.498
- Did you listen to it? - I listened to your songs.

1729
01:07:14.498 --> 01:07:15.928
I even saw your music videos.

1730
01:07:15.928 --> 01:07:16.969
(He's touched.)

1731
01:07:17.598 --> 01:07:18.969
You were the singer.

1732
01:07:19.328 --> 01:07:20.899
- I'm the main vocalist. - Exactly.

1733
01:07:22.239 --> 01:07:26.138
(Sung Kyu is the leader and main vocalist.)

1734
01:07:27.178 --> 01:07:28.808
"Be Mine". Was it "Sun"?

1735
01:07:28.908 --> 01:07:30.348
- Sorry? - What was the next song?

1736
01:07:30.348 --> 01:07:31.578
- Was it "Sun"? - "Sun"?

1737
01:07:31.578 --> 01:07:32.949
- What was the song? - The singer, Tae Yang?

1738
01:07:32.949 --> 01:07:34.978
Name other songs except "Be Mine".

1739
01:07:35.219 --> 01:07:37.018
- Other songs except "Be Mine"? - Yes, what were some other songs?

1740
01:07:37.248 --> 01:07:39.018
- "Paradise". - "Paradise"?

1741
01:07:39.288 --> 01:07:40.388
There was another one.

1742
01:07:40.388 --> 01:07:41.888
- "The Chaser". - Right, right.

1743
01:07:42.118 --> 01:07:44.158
"Man in Love", "Destiny",

1744
01:07:44.629 --> 01:07:47.098
"Back", "Bad", and "The Eye".

1745
01:07:47.328 --> 01:07:48.899
"The Eye". Yes, that song.

1746
01:07:48.899 --> 01:07:50.199
- Do you know the song? - Of course.

1747
01:07:50.199 --> 01:07:51.368
Then sing it for me.

1748
01:07:51.368 --> 01:07:53.368
What? You want me to sing?

1749
01:07:55.339 --> 01:07:57.509
(Making the sound of the wind)

1750
01:07:57.868 --> 01:07:59.239
(He tries to imitate the sound of a storm.)

1751
01:08:02.138 --> 01:08:03.678
That's a great song.

1752
01:08:03.678 --> 01:08:05.649
(What will their next destination be?)

1753
01:08:06.848 --> 01:08:08.678
(Streets in Jeonju are filled with Sung Kyu's memories.)

1754
01:08:08.678 --> 01:08:09.719
It's great.

1755
01:08:09.748 --> 01:08:11.788
(They walk alongside each other and make another memory together.)

1756
01:08:12.949 --> 01:08:14.618
(Gyeong Gyu feels lonely without his dogs.)

1757
01:08:14.859 --> 01:08:17.159
Should I be General for today?

1758
01:08:18.689 --> 01:08:19.959
(He welcomes Gyeong Gyu...)

1759
01:08:19.959 --> 01:08:21.399
(every time their eyes meet.)

1760
01:08:21.399 --> 01:08:22.899
