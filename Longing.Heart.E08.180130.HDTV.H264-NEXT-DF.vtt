Mr. Kang?

3
00:00:37.651 --> 00:00:39.523
Is this a dream?

4
00:00:42.224 --> 00:00:45.489
You gave me a piggyback ride
like this back then, too.

5
00:00:46.126 --> 00:00:48.406
Right, Mr. Kang?

6
00:00:51.523 --> 00:00:53.159
No.

7
00:01:06.272 --> 00:01:08.293
Look at me properly.

8
00:01:10.121 --> 00:01:12.278
I'm not Mr. Kang,
your teacher.

9
00:01:16.121 --> 00:01:18.091
There was...

10
00:01:19.367 --> 00:01:22.713
so much that I wanted to do
for you back then.

11
00:01:23.412 --> 00:01:26.412
And there was so much that
I wanted to say to you back then!

12
00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.240
But, because I was your teacher...

13
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.632
I had to hold myself back so much!

14
00:01:34.124 --> 00:01:35.730
So, do you really think...

15
00:01:36.422 --> 00:01:38.409
that I want to hear you
call me that again?

16
00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:40.203
But...

17
00:01:41.525 --> 00:01:44.776
You are my teacher, though.

18
00:01:44.776 --> 00:01:46.930
I told you, I'm not!

19
00:01:47.683 --> 00:01:48.966
Hmph.

20
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.730
Just...

21
00:01:52.288 --> 00:01:53.937
say that you are!

22
00:01:54.552 --> 00:01:56.291
This is my dream, anyway.

23
00:02:02.477 --> 00:02:03.861
Fine.

24
00:02:05.837 --> 00:02:07.281
Do it, then.

25
00:02:08.156 --> 00:02:09.968
Call me your teacher.

26
00:02:09.968 --> 00:02:11.792
See?

27
00:02:11.792 --> 00:02:13.468
You are Mr. Kang, after all.

28
00:02:27.125 --> 00:02:32.115
I really, really
wanted to see you...

29
00:02:35.053 --> 00:02:36.577
Mr. Kang.

30
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.874
But...

31
00:02:45.874 --> 00:02:50.299
isn't this our old school?

32
00:03:05.968 --> 00:03:08.424
This is just like that day.

33
00:03:09.822 --> 00:03:11.639
The day that I transferred
to this school.

34
00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:13.700
But you're not wearing
a skirt today.

35
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:14.761
Thankfully.

36
00:03:17.728 --> 00:03:21.987
Can't we go to the classroom, too?

37
00:03:21.987 --> 00:03:23.068
Sure.

38
00:03:23.744 --> 00:03:25.851
Do everything that you want to do.

39
00:03:37.786 --> 00:03:39.804
She's not back yet.

40
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.673
Where did those two go?

41
00:03:56.261 --> 00:03:58.575
Wow, what's this?

42
00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.135
I bet this is where that
flower bouquet guy sits.

43
00:04:09.048 --> 00:04:10.260
Huh?

44
00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:13.219
What the...

45
00:04:15.644 --> 00:04:19.459
How many women is he seeing that
he has this many rings?

46
00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.647
I don't know, either.
How should I know?

47
00:04:22.784 --> 00:04:26.623
Yeah, of course I came back to
the hospital. What else could I do?

48
00:04:27.459 --> 00:04:30.541
Am I supposed to go to the spot
where she's meeting up with her friends?

49
00:04:30.541 --> 00:04:32.548
Coming here?

50
00:04:32.548 --> 00:04:35.639
Well, I don't know.
It seems to have been futile, honestly.

51
00:04:36.966 --> 00:04:38.370
I mean...

52
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.228
I dragged her here so she could
get some rest in between working

53
00:04:42.228 --> 00:04:44.529
but Han Ji Soo is still
a workaholic, as ever.

54
00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:48.118
No way.
How could I give up now?

55
00:04:48.731 --> 00:04:51.022
I've only liked Han Ji Soo
for the past ten years.

56
00:04:51.651 --> 00:04:54.144
Yeah, yeah.
I'm an idiot.

57
00:04:54.144 --> 00:04:57.354
But still, I won't be the kind of idiot
who'll let her get stolen from me.

58
00:04:57.354 --> 00:04:58.748
By anyone.

59
00:04:58.748 --> 00:05:01.325
All right. Thanks for
wishing me a happy birthday.

60
00:05:01.325 --> 00:05:02.519
Okay.

61
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.536
<i>Who is it this time?</i>

62
00:05:17.536 --> 00:05:20.293
Oh, just someone.
She's someone you know.

63
00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:24.810
Is it Doctor Oh Young Joo
from the plastic surgery department?

64
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:25.810
Yeah.

65
00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.175
Aren't you tired of
dating so incessantly?

66
00:05:29.175 --> 00:05:31.212
You're only nice to me
when I'm dating someone.

67
00:05:31.212 --> 00:05:34.106
I'd be so much nicer to you, if only
you didn't say things like this.

68
00:05:36.777 --> 00:05:38.171
How's this one?

69
00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:40.332
I think this one
is the prettiest.

70
00:05:56.726 --> 00:06:00.050
This is different from
what she told me.

71
00:06:03.291 --> 00:06:04.377
Ow!

72
00:06:04.377 --> 00:06:06.519
Ow, damn it!

73
00:06:51.041 --> 00:06:54.192
Do you want to leave now,
if you're tired?

74
00:07:02.245 --> 00:07:04.123
Mr. Kang.

75
00:07:04.995 --> 00:07:07.846
Want me to tell you a secret?

76
00:07:08.967 --> 00:07:10.339
What is it?

77
00:07:10.339 --> 00:07:12.163
A long time ago...

78
00:07:12.652 --> 00:07:15.339
when we were trapped in the
classroom because of that fire...

79
00:07:15.339 --> 00:07:18.264
You have your phone, right?
Give it to me. I'll call someone.

80
00:07:18.264 --> 00:07:20.882
I don't have my cellphone.

81
00:07:20.882 --> 00:07:23.199
To be honest, back then...

82
00:07:24.019 --> 00:07:26.606
I did have my phone.

83
00:07:27.327 --> 00:07:29.168
I didn't know that.

84
00:07:38.634 --> 00:07:40.639
Now...

85
00:07:44.507 --> 00:07:47.462
that I've told you a secret...

86
00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:51.993
can't you grant me a wish?

87
00:07:51.993 --> 00:07:53.993
What wish?

88
00:07:55.074 --> 00:07:56.863
Tell me that...

89
00:07:58.661 --> 00:08:00.620
one more time.

90
00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:02.738
<i>It's all right.</i>

91
00:08:03.832 --> 00:08:05.154
It's all right.

92
00:08:06.373 --> 00:08:08.092
Just like you did before.

93
00:08:09.123 --> 00:08:11.687
That it's all right...

94
00:08:13.069 --> 00:08:15.397
because I'm here now.

95
00:08:15.397 --> 00:08:18.164
The mere fact that
you're in front of me now...

96
00:08:18.164 --> 00:08:20.459
And tell me that's more than good enough.

97
00:08:20.459 --> 00:08:22.694
That's more than good enough.

98
00:08:23.651 --> 00:08:25.363
Tell me that...

99
00:08:26.143 --> 00:08:27.802
just one more time.

100
00:08:29.155 --> 00:08:30.906
Just one more time.

101
00:08:37.258 --> 00:08:38.667
Huh?

102
00:08:38.667 --> 00:08:41.377
This is the ring that
I picked up for her.

103
00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.102
Did Flower Bouquet
buy this one for her?

104
00:08:51.319 --> 00:08:52.881
This...

105
00:08:54.065 --> 00:08:55.612
isn't a ring that
Flower Bouquet bought her.

106
00:08:55.612 --> 00:08:57.449
I bought this for her.

107
00:08:58.065 --> 00:08:59.417
<i>What's this?</i>

108
00:08:59.417 --> 00:09:00.869
<i>Isn't this a women's ring?</i>

109
00:09:00.869 --> 00:09:02.532
Um, yeah!
It's for you.

110
00:09:02.532 --> 00:09:04.493
It's for you.
I bought it to give to you.

111
00:09:04.493 --> 00:09:07.225
Why are you taking it, then?
If it's mine, give it to me.

112
00:09:07.225 --> 00:09:08.267
Huh?

113
00:09:08.267 --> 00:09:11.108
I’m going to see if it fits me.

114
00:09:12.494 --> 00:09:15.294
I definitely gave this to Mom.

115
00:09:15.294 --> 00:09:16.858
So how...

116
00:09:16.858 --> 00:09:18.979
does Ji Soo have this?

117
00:09:37.054 --> 00:09:38.727
It's okay.

118
00:09:42.546 --> 00:09:44.263
It's okay.

119
00:09:47.569 --> 00:09:49.435
It'll be okay.

120
00:09:51.961 --> 00:09:54.893
It would be so nice...

121
00:09:56.097 --> 00:09:58.329
if I could turn back time.

122
00:10:00.859 --> 00:10:04.836
<i>A chilly breeze that
blew into my heart.</i>

123
00:10:04.836 --> 00:10:07.198
<i>The periphery of those eyes</i>

124
00:10:07.198 --> 00:10:10.291
<i>that turned a fiery red
before the truth.</i>

125
00:10:10.975 --> 00:10:12.804
<i>It may have been that,
at that moment...</i>

126
00:10:12.804 --> 00:10:16.617
<i>I innately felt what
my true fate was.</i>

127
00:10:17.823 --> 00:10:22.093
<i>My true fate,
which I had been unable to avoid.</i>

128
00:10:50.842 --> 00:10:53.901
How did I get back here last night?

129
00:11:08.326 --> 00:11:11.081
Maybe it's just another ring
that looks similar?

130
00:11:11.809 --> 00:11:17.017
What are the chances that Ji Soo
would have the same ring...

131
00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:19.631
that I bought back then?

132
00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:24.278
Did you sleep well?

133
00:11:24.278 --> 00:11:25.738
Yes.

134
00:11:25.738 --> 00:11:30.352
Um, did your teacher bring me back
here yesterday, by any chance?

135
00:11:30.352 --> 00:11:32.730
No, I brought you back.

136
00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:34.780
And Mr. Kang took
Mr. Min Seok home.

137
00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:35.978
Oh, really?

138
00:11:35.978 --> 00:11:39.326
Oh yeah, I had something to
ask you, Deok Goo.

139
00:11:39.326 --> 00:11:40.387
What is it?

140
00:11:40.387 --> 00:11:43.330
A patient that I treated
in Seoul sent me a text

141
00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:45.306
but I don't understand
what they wrote.

142
00:11:51.086 --> 00:11:52.557
What does this say?

143
00:11:52.557 --> 00:11:53.675
Um...

144
00:11:53.675 --> 00:11:57.324
<i>[U no u ha da pretst face in world, Doc?]</i>
Did they write to you in a secret code?

145
00:11:58.254 --> 00:11:59.775
You don't know, either?

146
00:11:59.775 --> 00:12:01.891
But you're a high schooler,
just like this patient!

147
00:12:08.119 --> 00:12:11.455
"You do the best face the world, Doc."
(Means "you're pretty")

148
00:12:11.455 --> 00:12:14.132
"Do I admit that?
Yeah, I admit that."

149
00:12:14.132 --> 00:12:17.507
"Real facts.
Impossible to refute."

150
00:12:18.724 --> 00:12:20.238
And who the hell is this?

151
00:12:20.238 --> 00:12:23.039
What does he mean,
"you do the best face?"

152
00:12:23.039 --> 00:12:25.123
I'm not a plastic surgeon, though.

153
00:12:25.123 --> 00:12:26.647
I'm an orthopedic surgeon.

154
00:12:26.647 --> 00:12:28.421
This is a plastic surgery ward, right?

155
00:12:28.421 --> 00:12:30.970
Then, are orthopedic surgeons
the ones who make the "best faces?"

156
00:12:34.079 --> 00:12:37.411
I can't understand the lingo
that kids use nowadays.

157
00:12:37.411 --> 00:12:38.616
Hah!

158
00:12:38.616 --> 00:12:41.241
Why are you talking about them like
that when you're a School Luncher, too?

159
00:12:41.241 --> 00:12:42.479
What's a "school luncher?"

160
00:12:42.479 --> 00:12:43.945
Just wait until later
when you'll have to wrestle with

161
00:12:43.945 --> 00:12:45.814
the other school lunchers
for 12 hours.

162
00:12:45.814 --> 00:12:47.637
Then you'll learn all of their lingo.

163
00:12:47.637 --> 00:12:50.517
Ugh, I don't want to go to school.

164
00:12:50.517 --> 00:12:53.478
You have no choice but to go,
if you don't want to end up broke.

165
00:12:53.478 --> 00:12:55.275
Ugh, you!

166
00:12:55.956 --> 00:12:59.161
I don't want to hear that from you, when
you've been cutting school all this time.

167
00:12:59.161 --> 00:13:02.477
But, um, why did you
tell me to tell Ji Soo

168
00:13:02.477 --> 00:13:05.679
that I brought her
back here yesterday?

169
00:13:14.916 --> 00:13:16.660
Shin Woo.

170
00:13:19.132 --> 00:13:20.884
I'm sorry.

171
00:13:26.978 --> 00:13:29.504
I want her to think that
it was all really a dream

172
00:13:29.504 --> 00:13:31.946
and forget about it all.

173
00:13:33.127 --> 00:13:37.532
At any rate, don't forget about what
I told you, and look into it for me.

174
00:13:37.532 --> 00:13:39.374
You have to do something to
repay me for your hospital fee!

175
00:13:39.374 --> 00:13:41.950
Do you know how many months' worth
of my paycheck you're using up right now?

176
00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:44.086
Ugh, all right, already!

177
00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.305
I'll be going now.

178
00:13:46.795 --> 00:13:48.489
See you later!

179
00:13:48.489 --> 00:13:51.064
And don't cut school to go
somewhere else, you hear?

180
00:14:01.116 --> 00:14:02.358
Here.

181
00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:07.273
So, did you have fun yesterday?

182
00:14:07.273 --> 00:14:10.924
It felt as if I went back in time
to ten years ago.

183
00:14:11.626 --> 00:14:13.632
But I think I drank way too much.

184
00:14:13.632 --> 00:14:15.869
I bet you were calling out
that teacher's name again, then.

185
00:14:15.869 --> 00:14:19.175
You always say your old homeroom
teacher's name when you get drunk.

186
00:14:19.175 --> 00:14:20.348
It makes me so jealous.

187
00:14:20.348 --> 00:14:23.665
I just really want to visit him.

188
00:14:23.665 --> 00:14:26.708
But I can't find him,
no matter how hard I try.

189
00:14:30.066 --> 00:14:34.595
You didn't really spend your birthday
alone yesterday, did you, Senior?

190
00:14:34.595 --> 00:14:36.190
Are you kidding me?

191
00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:38.325
It took an hour just for me
to blow out the candles.

192
00:14:38.325 --> 00:14:42.605
The girls that I was with just kept
singing happy birthday over and over!

193
00:14:43.142 --> 00:14:45.425
I knew that would be the case,
which was why I didn't go.

194
00:14:45.425 --> 00:14:47.118
But in exchange, you have to
give me two presents.

195
00:14:47.118 --> 00:14:49.306
I'll give you three.
Three.

196
00:14:49.306 --> 00:14:51.994
So all of that is just an act, huh?

197
00:14:53.073 --> 00:14:54.526
All right, then.

198
00:14:54.526 --> 00:14:57.542
Then I'll put on an act, too.

199
00:15:00.325 --> 00:15:02.200
About those three presents, though.

200
00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.646
Can one of them be a
promise you make to me?

201
00:15:04.646 --> 00:15:06.148
What kind of promise?

202
00:15:06.148 --> 00:15:09.604
When I tell you the time and place

203
00:15:09.604 --> 00:15:11.392
you have to come and see me
no matter what

204
00:15:11.392 --> 00:15:14.945
no matter who you may be with,
no questions asked.

205
00:15:14.945 --> 00:15:19.194
I'll use this favor on a day
that I really need you.

206
00:15:19.975 --> 00:15:21.292
All right.

207
00:15:21.292 --> 00:15:23.047
It's a promise, then!

208
00:15:26.112 --> 00:15:27.901
Doctor.

209
00:15:29.439 --> 00:15:31.027
I like you.

210
00:15:33.214 --> 00:15:34.728
Hey, High Schooler.

211
00:15:34.728 --> 00:15:36.220
Was your name Deok Goo,
or something?

212
00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:38.584
There's a long line
for this doctor here

213
00:15:38.584 --> 00:15:40.653
so if we line all those guys up
by age, oldest to youngest

214
00:15:40.653 --> 00:15:42.164
you'll never get a turn with her.

215
00:15:42.164 --> 00:15:43.695
I have no idea
what you mean.

216
00:15:43.695 --> 00:15:47.171
The person I like isn't her...

217
00:15:47.881 --> 00:15:48.993
but you.

218
00:15:51.094 --> 00:15:52.478
Me?

219
00:15:53.214 --> 00:15:54.310
Yes.

220
00:15:59.967 --> 00:16:02.670
So, you want to be a doctor
when you grow up?

221
00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:04.103
That's what you're saying, right?

222
00:16:04.103 --> 00:16:06.272
Not a doctor, exactly.

223
00:16:06.272 --> 00:16:08.940
But it'll be similar in the sense that
people will refer to me with respect.

224
00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:10.398
Then, what you meant when
you said that you liked me

225
00:16:10.398 --> 00:16:13.137
was that you respect me
or admire me, right?

226
00:16:13.137 --> 00:16:15.741
I guess... you could say
that I admire you, yes.

227
00:16:15.741 --> 00:16:18.850
How could you say "I like you"
to another man so nonchalantly?

228
00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:20.217
You scared me!

229
00:16:20.217 --> 00:16:22.747
I've done it once before.

230
00:16:24.858 --> 00:16:25.950
What?

231
00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:27.681
Don't worry about it.

232
00:16:27.681 --> 00:16:29.439
Ugh, seriously?

233
00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:34.280
Wait, so, what was it
that you were curious about?

234
00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.805
Um...

235
00:16:36.305 --> 00:16:38.198
Do you have to go study abroad,
no matter what

236
00:16:38.198 --> 00:16:40.549
if you want to be a doctor?

237
00:16:40.549 --> 00:16:42.772
I know that Doctor Han Ji Soo
studied abroad.

238
00:16:42.772 --> 00:16:44.415
Oh, nah.

239
00:16:44.415 --> 00:16:46.845
Ji Soo only attended
high school in the U.S.

240
00:16:46.845 --> 00:16:48.805
and went to college
in Korea with me.

241
00:16:48.805 --> 00:16:50.763
If you even attended college
with her too, then...

242
00:16:50.763 --> 00:16:52.651
Six, seven... eight years?

243
00:16:54.652 --> 00:16:55.652
Ugh.

244
00:16:57.275 --> 00:17:00.692
If she was going to stop
studying abroad so soon

245
00:17:00.692 --> 00:17:02.933
why did she go?
Do you know?

246
00:17:02.933 --> 00:17:04.090
I don't know.

247
00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:06.779
I just know that
she didn't want to.

248
00:17:06.779 --> 00:17:09.111
Her parents probably
forced her to go abroad.

249
00:17:09.651 --> 00:17:11.047
Forced her?

250
00:17:11.651 --> 00:17:15.749
And... nothing happened to her
when she was in college?

251
00:17:15.749 --> 00:17:16.834
Hey, Squirt.

252
00:17:16.834 --> 00:17:19.996
Something significant happens
each and every day of med school.

253
00:17:19.996 --> 00:17:21.220
Then...

254
00:17:21.669 --> 00:17:27.059
do you know why Doctor Han Ji Soo never
came back here once, for all those years?

255
00:17:27.059 --> 00:17:29.069
Hey, I'm curious about that myself.

256
00:17:29.069 --> 00:17:32.311
I wonder why she refused to talk about
Garam Island at all, for all this time.

257
00:17:32.311 --> 00:17:37.005
I think it may be because she can't ride
on boats that she didn't come here.

258
00:17:37.005 --> 00:17:40.266
Doctor Han Ji Soo...
can't ride on boats?

259
00:17:40.266 --> 00:17:41.350
Yeah.

260
00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:44.056
So she suffered quite a lot
when we were on our way here.

261
00:17:48.923 --> 00:17:50.487
Hey, Deok Goo.

262
00:17:50.487 --> 00:17:52.798
Do you want to be with Han Ji Soo
when you grow up, or something?

263
00:17:52.798 --> 00:17:56.032
It's too bad, though, because I'm
the first one in line for her.

264
00:17:56.032 --> 00:17:58.883
She'll be off the market before
you've even finished growing up.

265
00:18:01.208 --> 00:18:03.948
Hang in there, though.
Good luck.

266
00:18:07.235 --> 00:18:09.054
I'm plenty grown.

267
00:18:09.054 --> 00:18:13.711
And you should take another look.
There's someone else who's first in line.

268
00:18:14.282 --> 00:18:16.529
At any rate, thank you.

269
00:18:17.691 --> 00:18:18.989
Oh yeah.

270
00:18:18.989 --> 00:18:24.374
If you didn't study abroad,
you probably didn't go to the army yet.

271
00:18:24.374 --> 00:18:25.940
Oh, goodness!

272
00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:28.828
Hang in there, though.
Good luck!

273
00:18:29.962 --> 00:18:31.144
Ugh, that little...

274
00:18:31.144 --> 00:18:35.020
The way he pisses me off
really reminds me of someone.

275
00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:37.548
Ugh, that bastard.

276
00:18:41.642 --> 00:18:43.509
Well? Did you look into it?

277
00:18:43.509 --> 00:18:47.265
Yes. I don't think anything
too significant happened.

278
00:18:47.265 --> 00:18:49.018
But apparently...

279
00:18:49.503 --> 00:18:50.894
Ji Soo...

280
00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:53.273
can't ride on boats.

281
00:18:53.273 --> 00:18:55.182
<i>Have you heard that?</i>

282
00:18:55.182 --> 00:18:56.516
I haven't.

283
00:18:56.516 --> 00:18:57.786
Boats?

284
00:18:59.659 --> 00:19:01.309
Well, at any rate, all right.

285
00:19:01.309 --> 00:19:03.624
I'll take one day of your
hospital stay off your debt.

286
00:19:03.624 --> 00:19:05.010
Okay.

287
00:19:08.893 --> 00:19:10.029
Boats?

288
00:19:10.029 --> 00:19:12.433
I heard that Ji Soo came to Garam Island.

289
00:19:12.433 --> 00:19:14.261
How did you know that, Na Hee?

290
00:19:14.261 --> 00:19:15.698
Geon Deok told me.

291
00:19:15.698 --> 00:19:17.138
- Geon Deok did?
- Yeah.

292
00:19:17.163 --> 00:19:19.028
You keep in touch with
Geon Deok, Na Hee?

293
00:19:19.644 --> 00:19:22.402
Well, yeah, of course
we keep in touch!

294
00:19:22.402 --> 00:19:24.095
He's my disciple too, after all!

295
00:19:24.095 --> 00:19:25.811
What, you got a problem with that?

296
00:19:25.811 --> 00:19:27.665
What? I didn't say anything!

297
00:19:29.175 --> 00:19:30.442
What is your problem?

298
00:19:31.519 --> 00:19:32.941
Oh, Shin Woo.

299
00:19:32.941 --> 00:19:35.133
Answer this question for me, as a man.

300
00:19:35.133 --> 00:19:38.009
How much of a man's words
can I really trust?

301
00:19:38.009 --> 00:19:41.205
Why? Are you dating someone
right now, Na Hee?

302
00:19:41.205 --> 00:19:43.336
Dating?
As if!

303
00:19:43.336 --> 00:19:47.001
This is all because of that
bastard, Kang Shin Woo!

304
00:19:47.001 --> 00:19:49.335
- Huh?
- You know, your old homeroom teacher!

305
00:19:49.335 --> 00:19:50.393
The bastard that ran off
with my car!

306
00:19:50.393 --> 00:19:52.056
What do you mean, ran away?

307
00:19:52.056 --> 00:19:53.719
That's not fair of you to say that.

308
00:19:53.719 --> 00:19:55.118
I heard you got your car back.

309
00:19:55.118 --> 00:19:57.481
Yeah, but he ran off,
never to be seen again!

310
00:19:57.481 --> 00:20:00.144
What? "You'll see me so much
that you'll be sick of me?"

311
00:20:00.144 --> 00:20:02.798
He said that, and then disappeared!

312
00:20:02.798 --> 00:20:07.686
Because of what he said,
I just can't trust men's words anymore!

313
00:20:08.582 --> 00:20:13.191
Looks like I can't escape his shadow,
no matter where I go.

314
00:20:18.727 --> 00:20:19.727
Oh yeah.

315
00:20:20.473 --> 00:20:22.326
But you know, Na Hee.

316
00:20:23.093 --> 00:20:25.321
It could be that he wasn't lying.

317
00:20:25.872 --> 00:20:28.019
It could be exactly
as he'd said.

318
00:20:28.019 --> 00:20:29.715
What that man said, I mean.

319
00:20:33.346 --> 00:20:35.443
What is he saying?

320
00:20:36.115 --> 00:20:37.470
Ugh.

321
00:20:43.544 --> 00:20:46.236
What's this?
It's a hairpin!

322
00:20:46.236 --> 00:20:48.566
Why are you giving me a gift, when
you're the one who's graduating?

323
00:20:48.566 --> 00:20:49.819
Teach.

324
00:20:49.819 --> 00:20:52.914
Doesn't this look
like a dog chew?

325
00:20:53.479 --> 00:20:56.536
Now that you mention it,
it kind of does, yeah.

326
00:20:56.536 --> 00:20:58.962
Then, think of this
as a dog chew

327
00:20:58.962 --> 00:21:03.017
and if you ever go out drinking with a
person, and they happen to be male

328
00:21:03.017 --> 00:21:04.569
make sure you put this on
before you go

329
00:21:04.569 --> 00:21:05.798
while I'm away in Seoul.

330
00:21:05.798 --> 00:21:08.638
And when you really, really
want to chew on something

331
00:21:08.638 --> 00:21:10.638
Don't bite down on
anything else...

332
00:21:12.571 --> 00:21:14.546
but this.
This, okay?

333
00:21:14.546 --> 00:21:17.079
Why, you little...
am I dog, huh?

334
00:21:17.079 --> 00:21:19.162
Am I a dog?
Hurry up and get out of here!

335
00:21:19.162 --> 00:21:21.010
- Did you know, Teach?
- Know what?

336
00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:22.432
I like you.

337
00:21:22.432 --> 00:21:25.593
I'm not your disciple anymore!

338
00:21:26.298 --> 00:21:28.173
Ugh, no, no.

339
00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:33.652
Choo Geun Deok.

340
00:21:36.515 --> 00:21:37.977
Ms. Baek.

341
00:21:37.977 --> 00:21:41.442
Why is it that you're always reading
articles about Choo Geun Deok?

342
00:21:42.727 --> 00:21:44.785
This is why you can't date anyone.

343
00:21:46.363 --> 00:21:49.799
That little... ugh!

344
00:21:52.413 --> 00:21:54.959
Ji Soo can't ride boats?

345
00:21:55.518 --> 00:21:57.961
I've never heard about that.

346
00:22:06.737 --> 00:22:08.324
Yeah, Min Seok.

347
00:22:08.324 --> 00:22:09.643
Where are you?

348
00:22:09.643 --> 00:22:11.522
Coffee!

349
00:22:14.546 --> 00:22:19.546
<font color="E06287">[DramaFever Ver] E08 Longing Heart</font>
<font color="#7474C1">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

350
00:22:23.057 --> 00:22:24.583
What are you doing?

351
00:22:24.583 --> 00:22:26.051
Huh?

352
00:22:26.051 --> 00:22:27.948
Oh, Geun Deok gave me this.

353
00:22:27.948 --> 00:22:30.580
He said that I have to take better
care of my skin when I'm home.

354
00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:31.727
Do you want one, too?

355
00:22:31.727 --> 00:22:33.342
Ugh, no thanks.

356
00:22:33.342 --> 00:22:35.424
- I have to head out.
- Are you going somewhere?

357
00:22:35.424 --> 00:22:37.316
I'm not making food anymore.

358
00:22:37.316 --> 00:22:39.480
And I won't do the dishes,
or do the laundry anymore, either.

359
00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:40.843
And you have to watch the kids
from now on, too.

360
00:22:40.843 --> 00:22:43.895
Are those... divorce papers,
by any chance?

361
00:22:43.895 --> 00:22:45.784
It's my resume.

362
00:22:45.784 --> 00:22:47.532
I'm going to go get a job.

363
00:22:47.532 --> 00:22:49.059
A job?
Where?

364
00:22:49.059 --> 00:22:51.256
Where else?
A hair salon, of course.

365
00:22:51.256 --> 00:22:56.000
I even have my license, so it'd be a
shame to let my talent go to waste.

366
00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.098
So, um... give it a shot, if you want to.

367
00:22:59.098 --> 00:23:00.526
Try doing what you want to do.

368
00:23:00.526 --> 00:23:02.749
I'll make money for us.

369
00:23:02.749 --> 00:23:03.946
So Ra.

370
00:23:03.946 --> 00:23:06.800
But in exchange, all your money
is mine if you make it big, got it?

371
00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:08.970
You know that, right?
I'll open my own salon.

372
00:23:09.673 --> 00:23:11.085
But, um, So Ra.

373
00:23:11.085 --> 00:23:12.269
Think about this carefully.

374
00:23:12.269 --> 00:23:13.339
What do you mean?

375
00:23:13.339 --> 00:23:15.763
I've always done the dishes,
laundry, and child-rearing.

376
00:23:15.763 --> 00:23:17.753
And all my money was always
all yours from the start.

377
00:23:17.753 --> 00:23:20.049
And it's not like anything here
belongs to me.

378
00:23:20.049 --> 00:23:22.567
I don't need anything else.
All I need is you.

379
00:23:23.122 --> 00:23:26.144
Is there a mask I can put on a
mouth that says stupid things?

380
00:23:26.753 --> 00:23:28.255
No, I didn't see anything like that.

381
00:23:28.255 --> 00:23:29.517
What's this?

382
00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:34.255
Who is it?

383
00:23:35.748 --> 00:23:38.938
You're asking if something was off
about Ji Soo ten years ago?

384
00:23:38.938 --> 00:23:40.369
Yeah.

385
00:23:40.369 --> 00:23:43.170
You were the one who
saw Ji Soo last among us.

386
00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:45.557
You gave me the book
at my mom's funeral

387
00:23:45.557 --> 00:23:47.125
telling me that Ji Soo
wanted you to give it to me.

388
00:23:47.125 --> 00:23:50.594
Oh, come to think of it,
back then...

389
00:23:54.535 --> 00:23:56.019
Ji Soo.

390
00:23:58.292 --> 00:23:59.661
Min Seok.

391
00:23:59.661 --> 00:24:01.430
What are you doing here?
Why don't you go inside?

392
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:03.419
I can't bring myself to go in.

393
00:24:03.419 --> 00:24:06.990
Give this to Shin Woo for me.

394
00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:10.291
I didn't think about it back then
since it was such a mess back then

395
00:24:10.291 --> 00:24:12.307
but it was a bit strange,
thinking about it now.

396
00:24:12.307 --> 00:24:14.285
Why did she come all that way,
only to leave?

397
00:24:14.285 --> 00:24:17.077
Did Ji Soo say that something
happened to her back then?

398
00:24:17.077 --> 00:24:18.862
Or, have you heard
anything about her?

399
00:24:18.862 --> 00:24:20.256
I don't know.

400
00:24:20.256 --> 00:24:21.994
Actually, back then...

401
00:24:22.445 --> 00:24:23.988
on the day of your
mother's accident...

402
00:24:23.988 --> 00:24:25.999
<i>What are you doing tomorrow?
It's the weekend, after all.</i>

403
00:24:25.999 --> 00:24:27.308
Shall we all go
hang out somewhere?

404
00:24:27.308 --> 00:24:28.554
Oh, sorry.

405
00:24:28.554 --> 00:24:30.506
I have to go to this thing tomorrow.

406
00:24:30.506 --> 00:24:32.529
So, you're going to go
study abroad, for sure?

407
00:24:32.529 --> 00:24:34.357
No, I'm not going.

408
00:24:34.357 --> 00:24:36.345
But, my parents said that
they'll get off my case

409
00:24:36.345 --> 00:24:38.347
if I just go to this event.

410
00:24:38.347 --> 00:24:41.048
Thanks to that, I'll be able to
take the ferry off this island.

411
00:24:41.586 --> 00:24:44.403
Ji Soo was planning to
leave the island that day?

412
00:24:44.403 --> 00:24:45.457
Yeah.

413
00:24:45.457 --> 00:24:48.559
So when I first heard
about the ferry incident

414
00:24:48.559 --> 00:24:51.700
I called Ji Soo first, because I thought
something might have happened to her.

415
00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:55.693
Then, do you know what time
Ji Soo was planning to take the ferry?

416
00:24:55.693 --> 00:24:58.773
Well no, I don't know that much.

417
00:24:58.773 --> 00:25:01.113
But at any rate, she wasn't
on the boat that sank

418
00:25:01.137 --> 00:25:03.186
which is probably why
Ji Soo is here now.

419
00:25:03.186 --> 00:25:05.928
But why are you asking about the incident
from back then, all of the sudden?

420
00:25:05.928 --> 00:25:07.646
Oh, it's nothing.

421
00:25:07.646 --> 00:25:09.152
Thanks.

422
00:25:11.636 --> 00:25:13.085
You know, don't you?

423
00:25:13.692 --> 00:25:16.784
Does Kang Shin Woo,
by any chance...

424
00:25:17.753 --> 00:25:19.401
still feel the same way?

425
00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:24.201
Hey, Kang Shin Woo.

426
00:25:25.076 --> 00:25:28.952
Do you really still like Han Ji Soo?

427
00:25:30.038 --> 00:25:31.142
Yeah.

428
00:25:31.142 --> 00:25:32.262
Hey, you idiot.

429
00:25:32.262 --> 00:25:33.476
How could you say that

430
00:25:33.476 --> 00:25:36.866
after what she did to us,
and what she did to you?

431
00:25:36.866 --> 00:25:39.133
She was well aware of the fact
that your mother died

432
00:25:39.133 --> 00:25:40.991
and yet she just left,
without a word.

433
00:25:40.991 --> 00:25:44.202
Without ever saying goodbye,
or even asking how you were doing.

434
00:25:44.202 --> 00:25:46.419
You were already suffering
through so much

435
00:25:46.419 --> 00:25:48.615
and yet, that bitch threw
a bomb at you and left!

436
00:25:48.615 --> 00:25:49.765
All right?

437
00:25:50.431 --> 00:25:51.835
So...

438
00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:54.522
she had no choice,
and had to do such a thing

439
00:25:54.522 --> 00:25:56.253
must have had
such a hard time.

440
00:25:56.253 --> 00:25:57.253
What?

441
00:26:01.076 --> 00:26:02.781
Hey, Jang So Ra.

442
00:26:02.781 --> 00:26:04.933
You know Han Ji Soo
better than that, don't you?

443
00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:13.818
You're taking a ferry
off the island right now?

444
00:26:13.818 --> 00:26:15.625
Yes, thank you.

445
00:26:15.625 --> 00:26:17.016
Yeah.

446
00:26:17.797 --> 00:26:19.613
There's something that
I need to check up on.

447
00:26:19.613 --> 00:26:21.491
I'll come right back,
on the next ferry.

448
00:26:22.854 --> 00:26:26.258
<i>[Departure times: 5:00, 8:00,
11:00, 14:00, 17:00, 20:00]</i>

449
00:26:27.246 --> 00:26:28.800
All right.

450
00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:30.411
But you know, Teach.

451
00:26:30.411 --> 00:26:34.074
There's something that
I find really odd...

452
00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:37.719
What the...

453
00:26:37.719 --> 00:26:40.673
ugh, he hung up without
even hearing me out.

454
00:26:45.429 --> 00:26:48.453
Are you an idiot?
Where else will you find the answer?

455
00:26:49.192 --> 00:26:51.185
The person in question
is right next to you, after all.

456
00:27:01.026 --> 00:27:03.075
She's not here, either.

457
00:27:04.464 --> 00:27:06.385
Did she go somewhere?

458
00:27:14.534 --> 00:27:17.463
This is definitely the ring
that I bought.

459
00:27:19.493 --> 00:27:21.679
Have Mom and Ji Soo...

460
00:27:22.336 --> 00:27:24.336
met before?

461
00:27:44.076 --> 00:27:47.423
Did you get home safely last night?

462
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:49.625
Yeah.

463
00:27:49.625 --> 00:27:52.127
Did you come out because
something happened?

464
00:27:52.127 --> 00:27:56.099
I had a job interview nearby which is
why I asked you to see me for a bit.

465
00:27:56.099 --> 00:27:58.597
To be honest, I was a little
happy when you called

466
00:27:58.597 --> 00:28:01.096
and asked me to meet up with you.

467
00:28:01.096 --> 00:28:04.241
I was worried that you'd refuse
to ever see me again.

468
00:28:04.241 --> 00:28:05.759
I'll be straight-up with you.

469
00:28:05.759 --> 00:28:07.978
Seeing you, even now,
makes me so pissed.

470
00:28:07.978 --> 00:28:12.013
Even now, seeing you makes me
angry and makes me feel betrayed.

471
00:28:12.013 --> 00:28:14.980
Was it so hard to just
say goodbye to us?

472
00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:18.037
Okay, fine. Let's say you had
no choice but to leave in a rush.

473
00:28:18.037 --> 00:28:22.440
Then, was it so hard to contact us
just once after you'd left?

474
00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:26.105
Did we mean that little to you?

475
00:28:26.865 --> 00:28:29.054
I'm really sorry.

476
00:28:33.862 --> 00:28:35.428
All right.

477
00:28:37.473 --> 00:28:40.332
I'm done venting now.

478
00:28:48.915 --> 00:28:51.231
I finally feel better.

479
00:28:52.198 --> 00:28:53.406
I think I kept it pretty short

480
00:28:53.406 --> 00:28:55.152
considering the fact that I've
wanted to say this for 10 years now.

481
00:28:55.152 --> 00:28:56.755
Because of Kang Shin Woo.

482
00:28:56.755 --> 00:29:00.327
So make sure you apologize
to Kang Shin Woo, too.

483
00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:01.893
Shin Woo?

484
00:29:01.893 --> 00:29:04.340
He always makes me into the bad one.

485
00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:06.345
It was like that 10 years ago,
and it's still that way now.

486
00:29:06.345 --> 00:29:09.512
Here I am, whining because I was upset.

487
00:29:09.512 --> 00:29:12.199
And yet, he was going through
such excruciating pain

488
00:29:12.199 --> 00:29:15.097
but he prioritized your
well-being above his.

489
00:29:15.809 --> 00:29:18.762
That's how he was to you.

490
00:29:19.422 --> 00:29:22.797
Didn't he say anything
to you yesterday, either?

491
00:29:23.377 --> 00:29:24.892
Yesterday?

492
00:29:43.758 --> 00:29:48.000
<i>Shin Woo took you back
yesterday, after all.</i>

493
00:29:50.515 --> 00:29:51.967
<i>It's all right.</i>

494
00:29:54.901 --> 00:29:56.509
<i>It's all right.</i>

495
00:30:00.013 --> 00:30:01.719
<i>It's all right.</i>

496
00:30:07.429 --> 00:30:10.394
I have no idea
what happened to you...

497
00:30:11.592 --> 00:30:14.278
or why you feel
remorseful toward me.

498
00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:17.267
I don't know yet.

499
00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:22.567
But if that's something
that is tormenting you...

500
00:30:24.397 --> 00:30:26.645
just forget about it all.

501
00:30:27.877 --> 00:30:30.164
Don't remember it...

502
00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:33.161
and don't recall it, either.

503
00:30:33.907 --> 00:30:35.826
Because, no matter
what it may be...

504
00:30:36.882 --> 00:30:39.278
I'll do it all for you.

505
00:30:41.795 --> 00:30:43.631
It's okay for you...

506
00:30:45.165 --> 00:30:47.433
to just be at ease.

507
00:30:57.381 --> 00:31:00.519
Oh, here.

508
00:31:00.519 --> 00:31:02.643
We still have it.

509
00:31:02.643 --> 00:31:04.166
Thank you.

510
00:31:07.698 --> 00:31:10.096
<i>[Study Abroad Info Session
Time: September 30th, 2007 at 3 p.m.]</i>

511
00:31:12.057 --> 00:31:14.743
If the info session
was at 3 p.m....

512
00:31:17.817 --> 00:31:21.201
does that mean she almost
got on the 2 p.m. boat, on that day?

513
00:31:22.579 --> 00:31:24.561
On the boat...

514
00:31:25.267 --> 00:31:26.483
that Mom had been on?

515
00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:34.001
Who is it this time?

516
00:31:39.679 --> 00:31:42.625
Who made you cry
this time, Doctor?

517
00:31:43.615 --> 00:31:45.484
Where is...

518
00:31:45.921 --> 00:31:47.611
your teacher, right now?

519
00:31:48.178 --> 00:31:50.327
Is it because of my teacher?

520
00:31:50.916 --> 00:31:52.992
Did he say something to you?

521
00:31:55.127 --> 00:31:57.134
What happened?

522
00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:59.326
What's wrong?

523
00:32:01.069 --> 00:32:02.914
Because I like him.

524
00:32:04.626 --> 00:32:05.740
Because...

525
00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:07.693
Because I like your teacher.

526
00:32:07.693 --> 00:32:08.888
I like our teacher, Mr. Kang.

527
00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:13.142
But...

528
00:32:13.991 --> 00:32:16.287
I mustn't like him.

529
00:32:17.401 --> 00:32:18.751
What...

530
00:32:19.848 --> 00:32:22.006
do you mean by that?

531
00:32:23.003 --> 00:32:25.481
Why mustn't you like him?

532
00:32:33.232 --> 00:32:36.306
This ring is yours, isn't it?

533
00:32:37.031 --> 00:32:39.648
Does it have something to do with this?

534
00:32:48.067 --> 00:32:49.993
This ring...

535
00:32:51.234 --> 00:32:53.661
is the reason why...

536
00:32:55.102 --> 00:32:57.340
I can't like your teacher.

537
00:33:02.053 --> 00:33:03.779
Where is...

538
00:33:04.991 --> 00:33:06.991
Shin Woo, right now?

539
00:33:41.844 --> 00:33:43.818
I'd like a ticket for the
2 o'clock ferry, please.

540
00:34:10.231 --> 00:34:11.916
<i>Ji Soo!</i>

541
00:34:22.315 --> 00:34:25.268
I waited until the morning...

542
00:34:26.632 --> 00:34:28.606
ten years ago...

543
00:34:29.333 --> 00:34:31.438
on the day before I left...

544
00:34:32.545 --> 00:34:34.545
on Firefly Bridge.

545
00:34:37.806 --> 00:34:40.159
I was hoping that...

546
00:34:40.869 --> 00:34:44.534
you'd see my note,
and come.

547
00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:48.385
But when you didn't show up...

548
00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:50.858
I knew...

549
00:34:50.858 --> 00:34:53.036
that I'd hoped that
you wouldn't come...

550
00:34:53.626 --> 00:34:56.320
from the very beginning.

551
00:34:57.561 --> 00:35:01.179
That causing you to hurt as well
would be too cruel of me.

552
00:35:05.213 --> 00:35:08.853
And I decided that I'd live the
rest of my life being miserable.

553
00:35:09.858 --> 00:35:14.351
I thought doing that would allow me
to atone for what I did to you.

554
00:35:15.583 --> 00:35:18.320
But I think all of that was a lie.

555
00:35:19.056 --> 00:35:23.577
It was just that I was scared
that you'd find out.

556
00:35:27.327 --> 00:35:28.971
But now...

557
00:35:29.505 --> 00:35:31.472
I really don't think I can do this.

558
00:35:47.773 --> 00:35:50.923
What... is this?

559
00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:54.226
Your mother's keepsake.

560
00:36:01.838 --> 00:36:03.864
I'm sorry, Shin Woo.

561
00:36:04.527 --> 00:36:06.903
I'm so sorry...

562
00:36:06.903 --> 00:36:09.293
that I'm the one alive
in front of you right now.

563
00:36:15.298 --> 00:36:17.135
What do you mean by that?

564
00:36:17.135 --> 00:36:19.844
Your mother died...

565
00:36:21.563 --> 00:36:23.389
because of me.

566
00:36:27.043 --> 00:36:29.599
What... do you mean?

567
00:36:30.576 --> 00:36:32.811
Why is it your fault...

568
00:36:34.833 --> 00:36:36.581
that my mom passed away?

569
00:36:36.581 --> 00:36:38.829
On the day of the accident...

570
00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:43.536
I met your mother.

571
00:36:43.536 --> 00:36:45.246
Right here.

572
00:36:48.672 --> 00:36:50.250
Well, I don't know.

573
00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:53.878
I think it'll be around dinnertime by the
time I get back from the info session.

574
00:36:53.878 --> 00:36:56.304
What are you doing today, So Ra?

575
00:36:57.559 --> 00:36:59.373
You're meeting up with Min Seok?

576
00:37:00.597 --> 00:37:02.936
All right, call me when you
part ways with Min Seok.

577
00:37:02.936 --> 00:37:04.909
Oh yeah, don't text me.

578
00:37:04.909 --> 00:37:07.637
My screen is broken,
so I won't be able to read it.

579
00:37:07.637 --> 00:37:09.583
The 2 o'clock ferry, please.

580
00:37:16.152 --> 00:37:18.898
Should I ask Shin Woo
to meet up with us, too?

581
00:37:22.108 --> 00:37:24.302
Oh, but I don't know his number.

582
00:37:24.302 --> 00:37:26.242
I should've memorized it.

583
00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:39.713
Excuse me, Student.

584
00:37:39.713 --> 00:37:43.324
You're my Shin Woo's
classmate, right?

585
00:37:43.324 --> 00:37:44.358
Yes.

586
00:37:44.358 --> 00:37:46.684
Oh, are you
Shin Woo's mother?

587
00:37:46.684 --> 00:37:47.905
Oh, yes, Miss.

588
00:37:47.905 --> 00:37:49.690
I'm Shin Woo's mother.

589
00:37:49.690 --> 00:37:51.481
You can use informal
speech with me, ma'am.

590
00:37:51.481 --> 00:37:52.818
I'm Shin Woo's friend, after all.

591
00:37:53.505 --> 00:37:55.103
Shall I do that, then?

592
00:37:55.103 --> 00:37:59.335
There's still some time, so do you
want me to buy you a beverage?

593
00:37:59.335 --> 00:38:00.748
It's raining too, after all.

594
00:38:00.748 --> 00:38:03.592
Oh, um, yes.

595
00:38:03.592 --> 00:38:06.110
All right, let's go this way.

596
00:38:08.445 --> 00:38:13.963
My Shin Woo is always late for school,
and isn't good at studying.

597
00:38:13.963 --> 00:38:15.943
Quite pathetic, isn't he?

598
00:38:15.943 --> 00:38:17.693
No.

599
00:38:17.693 --> 00:38:21.822
He's very athletic, kind,
and considerate.

600
00:38:21.822 --> 00:38:25.498
I've never met a friend as nice
as Shin Woo, even back in Seoul.

601
00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:30.851
He's my favorite of all my friends.

602
00:38:30.851 --> 00:38:32.563
Really?

603
00:38:33.804 --> 00:38:36.565
By the way, where are you
headed right now?

604
00:38:36.565 --> 00:38:37.675
Oh.

605
00:38:38.893 --> 00:38:40.277
Here.

606
00:38:40.918 --> 00:38:42.342
Are you leaving to study abroad?

607
00:38:42.367 --> 00:38:44.769
I'm just going to listen to
what they have to say about it.

608
00:38:44.769 --> 00:38:45.891
Oh.

609
00:38:46.373 --> 00:38:48.255
But, hey, um...

610
00:38:48.255 --> 00:38:52.110
did Shin Woo contact you
yesterday, by any chance?

611
00:38:52.110 --> 00:38:53.755
Shin Woo?

612
00:38:56.186 --> 00:38:59.380
Oh, my phone is broken, so...

613
00:39:00.561 --> 00:39:02.309
Oh.

614
00:39:02.309 --> 00:39:05.744
But, where are you headed, Ma'am?

615
00:39:05.744 --> 00:39:07.291
Oh, me?

616
00:39:08.592 --> 00:39:11.090
Well, I...

617
00:39:11.619 --> 00:39:14.465
I'm visiting someone
since they're ill.

618
00:39:14.465 --> 00:39:16.802
But they said that they're
all sold out of tickets.

619
00:39:16.802 --> 00:39:18.760
Oh, but I really have to go.

620
00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:20.588
This is bad.
What should I do?

621
00:39:20.588 --> 00:39:23.384
Would you like my ticket, then?

622
00:39:23.384 --> 00:39:25.385
Really?
Is that okay?

623
00:39:25.385 --> 00:39:27.621
I have no intention of
going to study abroad, anyway.

624
00:39:27.621 --> 00:39:29.269
I don't need to go.

625
00:39:29.269 --> 00:39:30.726
Here you go.

626
00:39:31.409 --> 00:39:34.152
All right, thanks. Then...

627
00:39:34.706 --> 00:39:38.581
Um... here.

628
00:39:39.126 --> 00:39:40.878
I'll give you this in
exchange for the ticket.

629
00:39:41.648 --> 00:39:45.148
Oh gosh, it fits you perfectly!

630
00:39:45.148 --> 00:39:47.403
This is too generous of a gift
to accept in exchange for the ticket.

631
00:39:47.403 --> 00:39:50.411
Then, can you do me a favor?

632
00:39:50.411 --> 00:39:54.697
Can you get your phone fixed
as soon as you leave from here?

633
00:39:54.697 --> 00:39:56.259
My... cellphone?

634
00:39:56.259 --> 00:39:57.800
Yeah.

635
00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:01.862
Oh, I'll be going since
the ferry is leaving now.

636
00:40:07.146 --> 00:40:09.974
It was really difficult to fix this.
Don't drop this again!

637
00:40:09.974 --> 00:40:11.764
- It's all fixed?
- Yes.

638
00:40:11.764 --> 00:40:13.333
Thank you.

639

640
00:40:17.048 --> 00:40:18.822
<i>[I'll wait for you at Firefly Bridge
at 1 p.m. tomorrow.]</i>

641
00:40:22.494 --> 00:40:24.615
<i>Yes, I'm Shin Woo's
homeroom teacher.</i>

642
00:40:24.615 --> 00:40:26.688
His mother is home right now, correct?

643
00:40:26.688 --> 00:40:28.226
Oh, Mom went out.

644
00:40:28.226 --> 00:40:29.340
Where did she go?

645
00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:31.315
<i>She said she was going
to meet with you.</i>

646
00:40:31.315 --> 00:40:33.594
<i>You said you were going to a
hospital off the island yesterday.</i>

647
00:40:33.594 --> 00:40:35.565
<i>So she went to take the ferry.</i>

648
00:40:38.141 --> 00:40:39.679
<i>N-no.</i>

649
00:40:39.679 --> 00:40:41.025
That ferry...

650
00:40:41.025 --> 00:40:43.387
<i>that ferry is going to
get into an accident!</i>

651
00:40:47.909 --> 00:40:49.572
Just a second.

652
00:40:51.090 --> 00:40:52.235
Hello?

653
00:40:52.235 --> 00:40:53.914
- Where are you right now, Kang Shin Woo?
- Mr. Kang?

654
00:40:53.914 --> 00:40:55.523
I asked you where you are right now!

655
00:40:55.523 --> 00:40:57.864
What's the matter?
Is something the matter?

656
00:40:57.864 --> 00:40:59.248
<i>Mom is...</i>

657
00:40:59.248 --> 00:41:00.942
<i>our mom is in danger.</i>

658
00:41:00.942 --> 00:41:01.983
<i>Pardon?</i>

659
00:41:01.983 --> 00:41:04.340
Our mom is in danger!

660
00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:08.822
"Our" mom?

661
00:41:08.822 --> 00:41:10.344
What's the matter?

662
00:41:10.344 --> 00:41:11.905
What happened to your mom?

663
00:41:11.905 --> 00:41:13.036
It's nothing.

664
00:41:13.849 --> 00:41:15.802
But I think I'll need to go for now.

665
00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:20.442
Let's talk about this again
after I get back.

666
00:41:20.442 --> 00:41:22.099
I'll call you.

667
00:41:22.717 --> 00:41:25.150
Shin Woo!
Shin Woo!

668
00:41:25.773 --> 00:41:27.364
I saw your mom...

669
00:41:27.878 --> 00:41:30.304
not too long ago.

670
00:41:32.378 --> 00:41:34.635
<i>I found out after that</i>

671
00:41:34.635 --> 00:41:38.652
that the ferry that I was
going to take had sunk.

672
00:41:40.447 --> 00:41:42.469
Do you get it now?

673
00:41:43.032 --> 00:41:45.820
The person who was supposed to
have been on that boat that day...

674
00:41:46.369 --> 00:41:47.777
was me.

675
00:41:48.791 --> 00:41:52.619
If I just hadn't given
your mother my ferry ticket...

676
00:41:54.159 --> 00:41:56.061
if I hadn't done that...

677
00:41:58.476 --> 00:42:00.219
so...

678
00:42:01.509 --> 00:42:03.980
don't you ever forgive me.

679
00:42:04.639 --> 00:42:07.063
Just hate me and despise me.

680
00:42:08.356 --> 00:42:11.188
And when you get tired of hating me...

681
00:42:13.679 --> 00:42:17.293
just forget everything.

682
00:42:18.063 --> 00:42:22.413
I'll live my life
forever remembering this.

683

<i>[Longing Heart]</i>

685
00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:41.406
<i>Didn't you treasure that book
more than anything else?</i>

686
00:43:41.406 --> 00:43:44.038
<i>I'm going to put it away since
I'm never going to read it again.</i>

687
00:43:44.038 --> 00:43:45.888
<i>Aren't you leaving me alone too much?</i>

688
00:43:45.888 --> 00:43:47.779
<i>- Did you see Ji Soo?
- I'm looking at her.</i>

689
00:43:47.779 --> 00:43:48.806
<i>Right now.</i>

690
00:43:48.806 --> 00:43:51.489
<i>Because she won't eat,
and she spends all her time in the ER.</i>

691
00:43:51.489 --> 00:43:53.741
<i>Hang out with me for
just one day, Doctor.</i>

692
00:43:53.741 --> 00:43:56.203
<i>You want to make it so that
Ji Soo can leave Garam Island?</i>

693
00:43:56.203 --> 00:43:58.122
<i>I once had a friend.</i>

694
00:43:58.122 --> 00:44:01.277
<i>But I wasn't able to say what I wanted to
say to her, and we were separated here.</i>

695
00:44:01.277 --> 00:44:02.553
<i>I just don't get it.</i>

696
00:44:02.553 --> 00:44:04.439
<i>Don't you like Ji Soo?</i>

697
00:44:04.439 --> 00:44:06.576
<i>I was happy to have met you, Mr. Kang</i>

698
00:44:06.576 --> 00:44:09.714
<i>because I found out that
I'd become a pretty decent adult.</i>

699
00:44:09.714 --> 00:44:12.841
<i>I'm going to go back
to the year 2007.</i>

700
00:44:32.529 --> 00:44:35.728
You're looking there, and the
spot over there is empty.

701
00:44:35.728 --> 00:44:37.290
So you'll go stand there.

702
00:44:37.290 --> 00:44:40.671
But then, she'll catch your eye.

703
00:44:40.671 --> 00:44:43.444
So Shin Woo stands over here.

704
00:44:43.444 --> 00:44:46.098
She looks mysterious
while she's sleeping.

705
00:44:47.591 --> 00:44:49.024
There you go.

706
00:44:55.761 --> 00:44:56.870
Enter here.

707
00:44:56.870 --> 00:45:00.948
When we go back in there, keep your mouth
shut and don't say anything unnecessary!

708
00:45:00.948 --> 00:45:02.897
It's these down times
where you say unnecessary things.

709
00:45:02.897 --> 00:45:04.069
Edit.

710
00:45:04.069 --> 00:45:06.132
Make sure you wriggle around a little.

711
00:45:06.132 --> 00:45:07.132
Cue!

712
00:45:08.535 --> 00:45:10.433
I know up to the
12 times table.

713
00:45:10.433 --> 00:45:11.584
Six times eight?

714
00:45:11.584 --> 00:45:13.165
Oh, um, up to
the 10 times table.

715
00:45:13.165 --> 00:45:14.388
Ow!

716
00:45:14.388 --> 00:45:15.564
We did it a lot.

717
00:45:15.564 --> 00:45:17.535
If you're wrong, I get to hit you.

718
00:45:17.535 --> 00:45:18.832
- Okay.
- Really?

719
00:45:21.593 --> 00:45:22.897
Oh!

720
00:45:24.339 --> 00:45:26.569
- Really?
- Yeah, come here.
