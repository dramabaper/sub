1
00:00:08.164 --> 00:00:09.834
But you think Ji Soo isn't good enough?

2
00:00:10.274 --> 00:00:11.633
She isn't educated enough?

3
00:00:12.174 --> 00:00:14.274
She isn't good enough for our family?

4
00:00:14.274 --> 00:00:15.914
That's what you think.

5
00:00:16.513 --> 00:00:18.614
You think our Ji Soo...

6
00:00:18.673 --> 00:00:20.644
lacks class and elegance.

7
00:00:20.644 --> 00:00:22.883
Tell me about Jo Soon Ok first.

8
00:00:25.114 --> 00:00:27.184
Are you the one who smuggled her away?

9
00:00:27.184 --> 00:00:28.324
You...

10
00:00:29.624 --> 00:00:31.294
No Myung Hee, you...

11
00:00:32.393 --> 00:00:35.363
You believe you're so classy and elegant,

12
00:00:35.363 --> 00:00:36.664
but you, Myung Hee...

13
00:00:39.463 --> 00:00:41.234
You lost our daughter...

14
00:00:41.463 --> 00:00:43.033
while going to meet another man.

15
00:00:43.603 --> 00:00:44.933
You lost Eun Seok.

16
00:00:53.444 --> 00:00:54.444
What...

17
00:00:55.383 --> 00:00:56.383
What do you mean?

18
00:00:58.654 --> 00:01:00.853
What are you talking about?

19
00:01:00.853 --> 00:01:04.023
You lost Eun Seok while going to meet another man.

20
00:01:04.354 --> 00:01:05.923
And she almost died that day.

21
00:01:05.923 --> 00:01:08.764
No way. Why would she die?

22
00:01:09.794 --> 00:01:11.393
If Jo Soon Ok wasn't watching her,

23
00:01:11.393 --> 00:01:13.803
how would she know Seo Tae Soo took her?

24
00:01:13.904 --> 00:01:16.374
Jo Soon Ok said he was her high school senior.

25
00:01:16.503 --> 00:01:18.134
She realized Seo Tae Soo when he gave a lecture...

26
00:01:18.134 --> 00:01:20.604
as a successful business man,

27
00:01:20.604 --> 00:01:23.773
so she was able to find Ji Soo at his house.

28
00:01:23.773 --> 00:01:24.973
No.

29
00:01:25.544 --> 00:01:26.984
Jo Soon Ok wasn't watching.

30
00:01:26.984 --> 00:01:29.253
It was only coincidence. She was lucky.

31
00:01:29.253 --> 00:01:32.053
So how would you know that?

32
00:01:35.253 --> 00:01:36.523
(From Kang Chul Min, To Choi Jae Sung)

33
00:01:38.354 --> 00:01:43.063
(Seo Ji An is not Choi Eun Seok.)

34
00:01:43.764 --> 00:01:45.634
I thought Jo Soon Ok sent me the letter...

35
00:01:45.634 --> 00:01:47.434
that said Seo Ji An is not Eun Seok.

36
00:01:48.163 --> 00:01:50.234
But you denied it so firmly.

37
00:01:50.833 --> 00:01:53.704
She's the key suspect, but you said you don't know.

38
00:01:54.104 --> 00:01:56.913
Isn't it important to know who sent me that letter?

39
00:01:57.714 --> 00:02:00.413
I think it's that woman, Jo Soon Ok.

40
00:02:02.613 --> 00:02:04.053
It's not her.

41
00:02:04.053 --> 00:02:05.753
I made sure she keeps her mouth shut.

42
00:02:06.484 --> 00:02:08.884
We should still find where she is.

43
00:02:08.884 --> 00:02:10.393
I'm looking for her.

44
00:02:10.954 --> 00:02:12.023
Suddenly...

45
00:02:12.523 --> 00:02:15.833
I thought you might know where Jo Soon Ok is.

46
00:02:16.664 --> 00:02:19.764
I was suspicious about you.

47
00:02:26.604 --> 00:02:28.403
Tell Mr. Jung to add more people...

48
00:02:28.403 --> 00:02:30.044
and watch her for 24 hours.

49
00:02:30.044 --> 00:02:31.173
Yes, ma'am.

50
00:02:32.384 --> 00:02:34.814
I knew you never let her go.

51
00:02:35.784 --> 00:02:37.484
So I met her.

52
00:02:37.484 --> 00:02:39.854
You went to Jo Soon Ok's house?

53
00:02:41.653 --> 00:02:43.093
I've never received any reports.

54
00:02:47.463 --> 00:02:49.363
You trust money so much.

55
00:02:49.933 --> 00:02:52.604
Money loses power in front of bigger money.

56
00:02:54.004 --> 00:02:56.234
I've heard it all from Jo Soon Ok's couple.

57
00:03:00.944 --> 00:03:04.074
She was holding Eun Seok in front of you.

58
00:03:06.643 --> 00:03:09.814
But you passed her as if you were blind.

59
00:03:14.923 --> 00:03:16.653
That's all I knew at that time,

60
00:03:17.493 --> 00:03:18.493
but...

61
00:03:20.593 --> 00:03:22.634
She said she can't wait any longer.

62
00:03:23.363 --> 00:03:25.463
Are you ready to send her to the Philippines?

63
00:03:25.463 --> 00:03:26.863
A long time ago.

64
00:03:27.604 --> 00:03:30.234
Get the ticket now, and send her away tomorrow.

65
00:03:31.604 --> 00:03:33.243
Take her to the airport right away.

66
00:03:34.104 --> 00:03:37.044
Prepare a million dollars for her to get there.

67
00:03:37.314 --> 00:03:39.044
I knew what it was.

68
00:03:39.884 --> 00:03:42.914
You kept her quiet until the foundation day.

69
00:03:44.254 --> 00:03:47.023
You even gave 1 million dollars...

70
00:03:47.023 --> 00:03:49.423
to people who made my daughter frightened...

71
00:03:49.423 --> 00:03:51.653
and starve all day long.

72
00:03:52.254 --> 00:03:54.224
Then I remembered the picture.

73
00:03:55.064 --> 00:03:57.134
I made people search because of...

74
00:03:57.134 --> 00:03:58.493
what Seo Tae Soo said before.

75
00:03:59.664 --> 00:04:01.463
You made people search?

76
00:04:02.833 --> 00:04:04.773
I found Ji Soo...

77
00:04:04.773 --> 00:04:06.474
where there was no trail...

78
00:04:06.474 --> 00:04:08.743
or houses. It was a remote place.

79
00:04:08.873 --> 00:04:10.574
It's remote?

80
00:04:11.843 --> 00:04:14.914
I wanted to know where my daughter was abandoned.

81
00:04:15.314 --> 00:04:17.114
It's very remote.

82
00:04:17.184 --> 00:04:19.523
There were 10 houses over the bridge,

83
00:04:19.523 --> 00:04:21.083
but after the big forest fire,

84
00:04:21.083 --> 00:04:22.523
everyone has left.

85
00:04:22.523 --> 00:04:23.754
It's still remote.

86
00:04:23.754 --> 00:04:25.864
It would've been worse 25 years ago.

87
00:04:26.663 --> 00:04:29.293
That's where Eun Seok was alone until late night.

88
00:04:29.793 --> 00:04:32.304
She was crying for a long time,

89
00:04:32.333 --> 00:04:35.103
but those people only watched her in the car?

90
00:04:35.533 --> 00:04:36.903
I was furious.

91
00:04:36.934 --> 00:04:38.903
You let those people go.

92
00:04:39.603 --> 00:04:40.843
Then...

93
00:04:41.244 --> 00:04:43.614
I remembered the photo from the investigation.

94
00:04:45.413 --> 00:04:46.684
What do you mean?

95
00:04:46.684 --> 00:04:48.384
There was no place to watch her...

96
00:04:48.384 --> 00:04:50.853
in their car for hours in those pictures.

97
00:04:51.413 --> 00:04:53.523
So I went back to Jo Soon Ok.

98
00:04:54.124 --> 00:04:56.994
I had to confirm it before you sent her away.

99
00:05:02.023 --> 00:05:05.163
You watched until someone took Eun Seok?

100
00:05:06.134 --> 00:05:07.634
Of course.

101
00:05:07.634 --> 00:05:11.033
That's how I knew Seo Tae Soo took her.

102
00:05:11.033 --> 00:05:14.174
Tell me where you hid the car to watch her.

103
00:05:14.643 --> 00:05:17.014
The forest nearby.

104
00:05:17.014 --> 00:05:18.374
Where in the forest?

105
00:05:18.374 --> 00:05:20.143
Before the bridge or after the bridge?

106
00:05:20.143 --> 00:05:21.343
Actually...

107
00:05:22.014 --> 00:05:24.713
It was before the bridge, right?

108
00:05:24.713 --> 00:05:25.783
Yes.

109
00:05:26.583 --> 00:05:28.324
25 years ago,

110
00:05:28.324 --> 00:05:30.554
it was a narrow trail before the bridge.

111
00:05:30.624 --> 00:05:32.223
There were only farms around.

112
00:05:32.494 --> 00:05:34.364
It was the same across the bridge too.

113
00:05:35.023 --> 00:05:36.364
There's no place...

114
00:05:36.364 --> 00:05:38.434
to hide your car because it's slanted.

115
00:05:40.564 --> 00:05:42.134
Did you really watch Eun Seok?

116
00:05:43.233 --> 00:05:44.934
For how long were you watching her?

117
00:05:46.603 --> 00:05:49.273
You took Eun Seok from Yangpyeong rest area...

118
00:05:49.273 --> 00:05:51.244
around 10:30am.

119
00:05:52.343 --> 00:05:55.043
You said you dropped her on that bridge right away.

120
00:05:56.083 --> 00:05:57.614
Then it was around 1pm.

121
00:06:00.924 --> 00:06:02.723
Where did you watch her for four hours...

122
00:06:02.723 --> 00:06:04.893
until Seo Tae Soo took her at 5pm?

123
00:06:05.723 --> 00:06:07.624
We weren't in the car.

124
00:06:08.064 --> 00:06:11.033
We were hiding under the bridge.

125
00:06:11.033 --> 00:06:12.333
For four hours?

126
00:06:12.333 --> 00:06:14.833
Yes. We almost died too.

127
00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:16.733
We couldn't even have lunch.

128
00:06:17.704 --> 00:06:20.804
Seo Tae Soo found her after 9pm.

129
00:06:28.483 --> 00:06:30.514
Jo Soon Ok dropped off Eun Seok during the day...

130
00:06:30.514 --> 00:06:33.353
and had a party at their friend's house after that.

131
00:06:34.083 --> 00:06:36.723
They said it rained at night on their way home.

132
00:06:37.324 --> 00:06:39.663
They slipped on the rainy road while...

133
00:06:39.663 --> 00:06:41.364
driving drunk and hit a telephone pole.

134
00:06:45.934 --> 00:06:48.304
We went to the repair shop to fix the car.

135
00:06:48.304 --> 00:06:50.273
Eun Seok was watching me inside the car parked...

136
00:06:50.273 --> 00:06:52.444
in front of a store next to it.

137
00:07:11.324 --> 00:07:13.223
Nice to meet you, everyone.

138
00:07:13.223 --> 00:07:17.163
I'm Seo Tae Soo, from the 15th alumnus...

139
00:07:17.163 --> 00:07:19.033
of Hantaek high school.

140
00:07:22.533 --> 00:07:23.903
What do you think...

141
00:07:23.903 --> 00:07:26.543
your bosses do at work?

142
00:07:26.543 --> 00:07:28.574
It was Seo Tae Soo, who came for a lecture...

143
00:07:28.574 --> 00:07:30.374
three years ago.

144
00:07:30.744 --> 00:07:32.983
He was even on the newspapers...

145
00:07:32.983 --> 00:07:35.444
in my town as a successful business man.

146
00:07:37.913 --> 00:07:40.853
How could that almost kill Eun Seok?

147
00:07:49.333 --> 00:07:51.694
The bridge was rebuilt in 1993.

148
00:07:52.093 --> 00:07:53.304
That night,

149
00:07:53.533 --> 00:07:55.364
August 19, 1992.

150
00:07:55.364 --> 00:07:56.973
It was swept by the heavy rain.

151
00:07:59.343 --> 00:08:01.773
You don't trust people easily.

152
00:08:02.713 --> 00:08:05.343
But you trusted Jo Soon Ok when she said...

153
00:08:05.343 --> 00:08:06.913
she watched until someone took her.

154
00:08:07.143 --> 00:08:08.913
Rather than doubting Jo Soon Ok,

155
00:08:10.083 --> 00:08:12.723
it's a lie that someone took Eun Seok...

156
00:08:13.454 --> 00:08:16.424
while you were unconscious from a car accident.

157
00:08:16.924 --> 00:08:18.194
The truth is that you were afraid...

158
00:08:18.194 --> 00:08:20.194
of people finding out about you leaving...

159
00:08:20.194 --> 00:08:22.934
without checking your daughter in the back.

160
00:08:24.463 --> 00:08:26.333
If people found out that was a lie,

161
00:08:26.333 --> 00:08:28.033
they'll also find out...

162
00:08:28.163 --> 00:08:31.633
who you met in Yangpyeong.

163
00:08:33.343 --> 00:08:34.944
You didn't say anything...

164
00:08:35.713 --> 00:08:37.144
even though you knew that much?

165
00:08:37.513 --> 00:08:39.743
Yes. I never said anything.

166
00:08:40.914 --> 00:08:44.184
It might be the reason you expect or not.

167
00:08:44.883 --> 00:08:46.983
Or there may be another reason.

168
00:08:47.824 --> 00:08:49.554
Anyway, I couldn't reveal it.

169
00:08:50.993 --> 00:08:52.723
So I still don't want to talk with you...

170
00:08:52.723 --> 00:08:54.363
about what happened 25 years ago.

171
00:08:55.524 --> 00:08:58.263
There's only one reason why I'm saying this now.

172
00:08:59.804 --> 00:09:01.833
Don't disturb Ji Soo's life.

173
00:09:04.304 --> 00:09:06.304
You don't have any rights to do that.

174
00:09:07.674 --> 00:09:10.473
Don't think about sending Ji Soo abroad ever again.

175
00:09:11.044 --> 00:09:12.883
And don't think about dragging her home.

176
00:09:13.544 --> 00:09:15.243
Don't bully Sunwoo Hyuk's family either.

177
00:09:15.684 --> 00:09:17.483
Give Yang Mi Jung her restaurant back.

178
00:09:19.324 --> 00:09:21.324
Are you saying I should give up my daughter?

179
00:09:21.654 --> 00:09:24.154
If you want her back, put an effort to be her mom.

180
00:09:24.824 --> 00:09:28.664
Don't act like Haesung's daughter, No Myung Hee.

181
00:10:13.144 --> 00:10:15.103
How could this happen to me?

182
00:10:15.274 --> 00:10:17.973
Ms. Min came to buy the bakery building.

183
00:10:18.274 --> 00:10:20.044
I will look into this and handle it.

184
00:10:20.343 --> 00:10:22.314
Don't worry, and wait for my call.

185
00:10:31.194 --> 00:10:33.424
(Father)

186
00:10:35.123 --> 00:10:36.133
Yes?

187
00:10:37.233 --> 00:10:40.463
Hyuk, I like Ji Soo too.

188
00:10:40.963 --> 00:10:42.934
But that was rash on your part.

189
00:10:43.534 --> 00:10:46.204
Someone came to my cafe to buy the building too.

190
00:10:46.204 --> 00:10:47.444
Hee.

191
00:10:47.743 --> 00:10:49.613
Her mother can't kick you and Nam Goo out...

192
00:10:49.843 --> 00:10:52.044
even if she buys buildings.

193
00:10:52.513 --> 00:10:54.644
You have over 4 years left,

194
00:10:54.644 --> 00:10:56.113
and he has 3 years left.

195
00:10:58.613 --> 00:11:01.184
That's not the only reason of my disapproval.

196
00:11:01.723 --> 00:11:04.424
I'd been married to a rich family because of Mom.

197
00:11:05.924 --> 00:11:07.363
Yes, he was rich,

198
00:11:07.694 --> 00:11:10.363
but he patronized me just because he had money.

199
00:11:11.564 --> 00:11:14.304
It's best to marry a girl with a similar background.

200
00:11:14.404 --> 00:11:18.074
Someone from similar families and conditions.

201
00:11:19.473 --> 00:11:21.804
Hee, right now,

202
00:11:22.103 --> 00:11:24.044
they are not getting married.

203
00:11:24.213 --> 00:11:26.914
He's right, Hee. We just started dating.

204
00:11:27.284 --> 00:11:29.013
You just started dating,

205
00:11:29.083 --> 00:11:31.213
but they're pressuring you by buying the buildings.

206
00:11:31.954 --> 00:11:34.853
What if you get serious and want to get married?

207
00:11:37.154 --> 00:11:39.593
It's better to end things now.

208
00:11:39.593 --> 00:11:40.894
What if the fate between me and Ji Soo...

209
00:11:41.524 --> 00:11:43.233
is similar to what is between you and Nam Goo?

210
00:11:45.934 --> 00:11:49.434
Actually, I thought that I got scared...

211
00:11:49.434 --> 00:11:50.574
which wasn't like myself.

212
00:11:51.973 --> 00:11:54.574
She could've been an important girl in my life.

213
00:11:55.713 --> 00:11:57.274
I don't want to run away without trying first.

214
00:11:59.243 --> 00:12:00.243
I agree with him.

215
00:12:22.434 --> 00:12:24.204
Boss, I'm finished making the vanity table.

216
00:12:24.934 --> 00:12:26.343
Sun Tae, give me more order slips.

217
00:12:26.343 --> 00:12:28.544
- Here you go. - Okay.

218
00:12:30.213 --> 00:12:31.713
Why is she working so hard?

219
00:12:33.284 --> 00:12:34.613
I'm not sure.

220
00:12:44.353 --> 00:12:47.324
Although it's small, it has an office and a yard.

221
00:12:47.493 --> 00:12:49.333
You can make better use of the space.

222
00:12:50.233 --> 00:12:52.164
But why is this factory on the market?

223
00:12:52.164 --> 00:12:54.904
Well, my partner mortgaged this factory for loans...

224
00:12:54.904 --> 00:12:57.274
and disappeared after taking all the capital.

225
00:12:58.833 --> 00:13:02.274
The factory manager said he'll bring engineers too.

226
00:13:02.613 --> 00:13:04.613
- Is that so? Good job. - Yes.

227
00:13:05.544 --> 00:13:08.113
- Let's see the warehouse. - Right. Let's get going.

228
00:13:10.253 --> 00:13:15.424
(Buyer: Choi Do Kyung)

229
00:13:17.853 --> 00:13:20.424
(Factory Sales Contract)

230
00:13:21.263 --> 00:13:24.233
Then I will see you when I pay you the rest.

231
00:13:24.233 --> 00:13:25.233
Okay.

232
00:13:25.333 --> 00:13:27.603
You said you wanted to clean the factor today.

233
00:13:28.863 --> 00:13:29.904
Thank you.

234
00:13:31.133 --> 00:13:33.174
Thank you for your kindness.

235
00:13:37.914 --> 00:13:39.243
Congratulations, Boss.

236
00:13:39.544 --> 00:13:42.083
Don't congratulate me yet. We haven't even started.

237
00:13:43.253 --> 00:13:44.753
This is all thanks to you.

238
00:13:45.654 --> 00:13:47.353
Is it because I invested in your venture?

239
00:13:47.583 --> 00:13:50.694
You're my reliable investor and secretary.

240
00:13:51.123 --> 00:13:52.723
- Let's go to the factory. - Okay.

241
00:14:09.574 --> 00:14:12.544
How much waste wood do we have?

242
00:14:13.083 --> 00:14:14.684
Pickup day is tomorrow, so we have a lot.

243
00:14:14.983 --> 00:14:15.983
That's great then.

244
00:14:15.983 --> 00:14:18.914
And hand over waste wood to Do Kyung from now on.

245
00:14:19.024 --> 00:14:20.024
Why?

246
00:14:20.353 --> 00:14:23.253
He just called. He bought the factory just now.

247
00:14:23.454 --> 00:14:25.194
He finished hiring the employees too.

248
00:14:25.593 --> 00:14:26.863
Already?

249
00:14:27.223 --> 00:14:28.993
He's quite driven.

250
00:14:29.233 --> 00:14:31.993
- What kind of factory? - Organic pet pellets.

251
00:14:32.434 --> 00:14:35.034
Isn't it great? He lowered his standards so low.

252
00:14:39.044 --> 00:14:40.373
Good for him.

253
00:14:44.574 --> 00:14:46.814
Your mother went out of the line this time.

254
00:14:47.983 --> 00:14:50.213
It's just because how she has been living her life.

255
00:14:50.253 --> 00:14:51.713
I will apologize on her behalf.

256
00:14:52.324 --> 00:14:53.623
Please don't.

257
00:14:54.654 --> 00:14:55.894
But...

258
00:14:57.753 --> 00:14:59.924
Why do you look so worried?

259
00:15:00.623 --> 00:15:02.894
Do you think I can't keep a promise I made to you?

260
00:15:03.934 --> 00:15:06.564
What did she say?

261
00:15:06.733 --> 00:15:08.363
You can continue working at the bakery.

262
00:15:08.934 --> 00:15:10.434
And was it Sunwoo Hyuk?

263
00:15:11.333 --> 00:15:14.144
She won't harm his family either.

264
00:15:18.144 --> 00:15:19.144
You don't...

265
00:15:20.243 --> 00:15:21.784
need to come back home either.

266
00:15:23.184 --> 00:15:24.353
Really?

267
00:15:24.583 --> 00:15:26.623
Can I really do that?

268
00:15:28.684 --> 00:15:30.394
Thank you so much.

269
00:15:34.324 --> 00:15:36.493
And I'll get you a place to stay.

270
00:15:36.493 --> 00:15:38.294
Will staying in this area be comfortable for you?

271
00:15:38.963 --> 00:15:41.133
An apartment or studio? Which do you prefer?

272
00:15:41.133 --> 00:15:43.774
No, it's okay. I can stay at the share house.

273
00:15:44.274 --> 00:15:46.674
I can't live by myself because I get lonely.

274
00:15:46.873 --> 00:15:50.414
I want to stay there since Do Kyung is there too.

275
00:15:52.814 --> 00:15:53.814
Sure.

276
00:15:54.544 --> 00:15:56.213
You can do that if that's what you want.

277
00:15:59.324 --> 00:16:00.383
Okay.

278
00:16:01.154 --> 00:16:02.184
However,

279
00:16:02.853 --> 00:16:05.623
call me anytime if you need or want anything.

280
00:16:07.394 --> 00:16:09.863
Okay, I will.

281
00:16:13.034 --> 00:16:14.333
Is your boyfriend...

282
00:16:15.064 --> 00:16:16.274
nice to you?

283
00:16:16.373 --> 00:16:21.473
Yes, It feels like a dream to be here with him.

284
00:16:31.383 --> 00:16:32.383
I guess it went well.

285
00:16:32.383 --> 00:16:33.954
Dad took care of it.

286
00:16:33.954 --> 00:16:36.524
I can work at the bakery, stay at the share house,

287
00:16:36.524 --> 00:16:38.194
and continue dating you too, Hyuk.

288
00:16:38.194 --> 00:16:39.363
- Really? - Yes.

289
00:16:46.564 --> 00:16:47.564
I'm so glad.

290
00:16:49.473 --> 00:16:51.034
I want to thank him...

291
00:16:51.404 --> 00:16:53.044
and apologize to him too.

292
00:17:06.684 --> 00:17:08.023
Hold on.

293
00:17:10.354 --> 00:17:12.094
(Do Kyung)

294
00:17:12.823 --> 00:17:13.823
Do Kyung.

295
00:17:14.963 --> 00:17:16.394
How did the meeting with Dad go?

296
00:17:16.733 --> 00:17:18.164
It went well.

297
00:17:18.164 --> 00:17:20.634
Everything all worked out.

298
00:17:22.704 --> 00:17:24.104
Did he really say that?

299
00:17:24.803 --> 00:17:26.144
Did Mom approve?

300
00:17:26.144 --> 00:17:29.243
I think so. He said not to worry about a thing.

301
00:17:29.773 --> 00:17:31.174
Really? I'm glad.

302
00:17:31.644 --> 00:17:33.844
- Tell Ji An. - Right, I should.

303
00:17:33.844 --> 00:17:35.584
I'll hurry and tell her about it.

304
00:17:35.884 --> 00:17:38.084
Okay. I got it. Bye.

305
00:17:39.253 --> 00:17:40.253
This is great.

306
00:17:59.973 --> 00:18:01.303
The vice chairman...

307
00:18:02.273 --> 00:18:05.144
It probably wasn't easy. I'm so grateful to him.

308
00:18:05.374 --> 00:18:06.414
I know.

309
00:18:06.884 --> 00:18:08.543
I'm really grateful,

310
00:18:08.543 --> 00:18:10.684
but I'm really sorry to him at the same time.

311
00:18:11.053 --> 00:18:12.654
You should call him and spend time together.

312
00:18:13.223 --> 00:18:15.823
He was also different to me compared to Ms. No.

313
00:18:16.793 --> 00:18:18.454
I'm sorry to you too.

314
00:18:18.993 --> 00:18:21.424
You had to move back home because of me.

315
00:18:21.723 --> 00:18:23.594
I was planning to move back anyway.

316
00:18:23.934 --> 00:18:26.233
The day you came was the day I was to move out.

317
00:18:26.634 --> 00:18:27.704
Really?

318
00:18:27.934 --> 00:18:30.674
You left your clothes and went grocery shopping,

319
00:18:30.674 --> 00:18:32.033
so I thought you left in a hurry.

320
00:18:32.134 --> 00:18:35.174
You didn't bring clothes, and grocery was nothing.

321
00:18:36.513 --> 00:18:39.114
I want to move back into our old home too,

322
00:18:39.414 --> 00:18:42.614
but if I do, it would put Mom and Dad in a pickle.

323
00:18:43.983 --> 00:18:45.823
You can't come back to my house.

324
00:18:45.924 --> 00:18:47.154
I know that.

325
00:18:47.624 --> 00:18:49.493
But it was nice to sleep with you again.

326
00:18:49.493 --> 00:18:51.194
It reminded me of our old days.

327
00:18:51.753 --> 00:18:52.864
Me too.

328
00:18:52.993 --> 00:18:55.424
Except it was suffocating since you hugged me tight.

329
00:18:55.523 --> 00:18:56.563
Hey.

330
00:18:58.134 --> 00:18:59.563
How's working here?

331
00:19:00.364 --> 00:19:02.473
When I work with wood, time flies by,

332
00:19:02.473 --> 00:19:04.303
and it occupies my thoughts. I like it.

333
00:19:05.134 --> 00:19:07.874
I knew it when you made me a wooden drawer.

334
00:19:08.344 --> 00:19:11.344
I am so happy that you are doing what you love.

335
00:19:11.344 --> 00:19:14.414
Then you should go now. I have to finish this.

336
00:19:14.414 --> 00:19:16.513
But I want to wait until you finish work.

337
00:19:16.513 --> 00:19:19.384
Let's make dinner at the shared house.

338
00:19:20.323 --> 00:19:21.584
At the shared house?

339
00:19:21.584 --> 00:19:23.823
Yes. I can't cook,

340
00:19:23.823 --> 00:19:25.493
so I will assist you well.

341
00:19:26.164 --> 00:19:27.563
Well, that's...

342
00:19:27.993 --> 00:19:29.334
- Wait. - Okay.

343
00:19:29.793 --> 00:19:31.134
(Myung Shin)

344
00:19:31.664 --> 00:19:32.963
Hey, Myung Shin.

345
00:19:33.763 --> 00:19:36.233
Tomorrow? I have time.

346
00:19:37.834 --> 00:19:39.874
How can I not go? I must go to congratulate you.

347
00:19:43.844 --> 00:19:45.114
You're back.

348
00:19:46.084 --> 00:19:47.344
Did you have dinner?

349
00:19:48.914 --> 00:19:50.084
I already ate.

350
00:19:51.513 --> 00:19:52.884
Give us some tea.

351
00:20:04.463 --> 00:20:05.463
When Do Kyung comes back,

352
00:20:05.463 --> 00:20:07.503
I will return the restaurant to Mi Jung.

353
00:20:08.404 --> 00:20:10.174
"When Do Kyung comes back"?

354
00:20:10.533 --> 00:20:13.473
Even though they saved Eun Seok in the past,

355
00:20:14.273 --> 00:20:16.114
they sent us the wrong child.

356
00:20:16.174 --> 00:20:18.114
We shouldn't be grateful to them for that.

357
00:20:19.184 --> 00:20:21.084
Besides, because they sent us Ji An,

358
00:20:21.084 --> 00:20:23.084
Do Kyung fell for her.

359
00:20:23.084 --> 00:20:25.983
They did a lot of damage to our family.

360
00:20:25.983 --> 00:20:27.854
You're still calculating?

361
00:20:28.523 --> 00:20:30.594
We could've not lost her in the first place.

362
00:20:34.223 --> 00:20:35.894
Why don't you stop talking about things...

363
00:20:35.894 --> 00:20:36.934
you shouldn't talk about?

364
00:20:37.463 --> 00:20:38.493
What?

365
00:20:38.934 --> 00:20:40.664
You found out about it 25 years ago,

366
00:20:40.664 --> 00:20:42.303
but you covered it up for 25 years.

367
00:20:42.303 --> 00:20:44.334
Then you shouldn't have brought it up forever.

368
00:20:44.634 --> 00:20:46.144
Do you want me to tell you...

369
00:20:46.844 --> 00:20:48.444
why I did that back then?

370
00:20:50.973 --> 00:20:53.914
You treated me so coldly as soon as we got married.

371
00:20:54.783 --> 00:20:57.414
You married me knowing who I am.

372
00:20:57.954 --> 00:20:59.053
Right?

373
00:21:02.283 --> 00:21:03.293
The feeling of being betrayed...

374
00:21:04.553 --> 00:21:07.094
gives you the power to do anything.

375
00:21:07.664 --> 00:21:09.793
Talking with you any more is meaningless.

376
00:21:10.463 --> 00:21:11.634
I met Ji Soo.

377
00:21:12.434 --> 00:21:14.263
I told her to keep working at the bakery,

378
00:21:14.263 --> 00:21:16.174
and I told her to stay at the shared house.

379
00:21:16.973 --> 00:21:19.473
I told her to go out with her boyfriend too.

380
00:21:19.473 --> 00:21:21.444
I also told her not to worry about his family.

381
00:21:24.813 --> 00:21:26.243
This is very much like you.

382
00:22:23.434 --> 00:22:24.773
Isn't he tired?

383
00:22:25.204 --> 00:22:27.243
How can he work for hours without any rest?

384
00:22:30.614 --> 00:22:31.914
Right.

385
00:22:32.043 --> 00:22:34.414
Work is the only way to get over the broken heart.

386
00:22:34.414 --> 00:22:35.654
You need to torture yourself.

387
00:23:16.924 --> 00:23:18.354
Ji An is on her way here.

388
00:23:18.354 --> 00:23:20.624
Is she? You should go to be first.

389
00:23:20.624 --> 00:23:22.124
You have work tomorrow.

390
00:23:22.694 --> 00:23:25.094
She's almost here, so I have to see her.

391
00:23:25.634 --> 00:23:27.463
She's finally coming home after months.

392
00:23:27.834 --> 00:23:29.473
I want to hear about Ji Soo too.

393
00:23:30.434 --> 00:23:31.503
I know.

394
00:23:31.934 --> 00:23:34.404
She sent me a message that she is okay.

395
00:23:35.813 --> 00:23:37.743
Mom, by any chance,

396
00:23:37.743 --> 00:23:40.084
are you willing to move to the countryside?

397
00:23:41.144 --> 00:23:42.184
No.

398
00:23:46.723 --> 00:23:49.354
It's not what you think.

399
00:23:50.894 --> 00:23:53.063
I don't want you to worry about us.

400
00:23:53.424 --> 00:23:56.894
We will never be a burden to you.

401
00:23:57.894 --> 00:23:59.364
Your father said it many times,

402
00:23:59.364 --> 00:24:00.963
as if he was leaving a will.

403
00:24:01.434 --> 00:24:03.773
And I'll work too now.

404
00:24:04.934 --> 00:24:07.273
So you're just like other mothers.

405
00:24:07.273 --> 00:24:08.973
You don't want to look after your grandchild.

406
00:24:09.213 --> 00:24:13.013
What? That's not it. I would do that anytime.

407
00:24:14.614 --> 00:24:15.983
But...

408
00:24:16.654 --> 00:24:18.414
it all depends on what Soo A wants.

409
00:24:19.854 --> 00:24:21.454
I'm home.

410
00:24:21.823 --> 00:24:23.493
- Hi. - Ji Tae.

411
00:24:24.894 --> 00:24:26.424
When you said, "I'm home",

412
00:24:26.793 --> 00:24:28.194
it finally felt real.

413
00:24:28.664 --> 00:24:30.263
You are really back.

414
00:24:30.563 --> 00:24:32.834
Don't say you are happy to see me again.

415
00:24:32.834 --> 00:24:35.404
Let's skip the embarrassing part.

416
00:24:38.674 --> 00:24:40.444
If that's what he said,

417
00:24:40.444 --> 00:24:42.674
Ji Soo should be relieved.

418
00:24:44.313 --> 00:24:46.384
I'm so happy for Ji Soo.

419
00:24:47.283 --> 00:24:50.614
Ji Soo is okay now, and Dad is getting better.

420
00:24:51.053 --> 00:24:52.783
Your eldest daughter is back too.

421
00:24:52.983 --> 00:24:55.223
There's nothing to worry about now.

422
00:24:57.354 --> 00:24:59.763
Is Dad getting better?

423
00:25:01.063 --> 00:25:02.733
How could he abandon us?

424
00:25:03.594 --> 00:25:05.563
When I told him that I was scared at night,

425
00:25:05.563 --> 00:25:07.604
he lit only my path with a flashlight.

426
00:25:07.604 --> 00:25:08.864
And when I told him about Ji Ho,

427
00:25:08.864 --> 00:25:11.233
he instantly looked worried.

428
00:25:12.344 --> 00:25:14.043
It wasn't something difficult.

429
00:25:15.003 --> 00:25:16.844
But we were too indifferent to him.

430
00:25:18.114 --> 00:25:19.313
When will he realize...

431
00:25:19.313 --> 00:25:21.213
that the symptoms are going away?

432
00:25:22.213 --> 00:25:23.783
It would take about a month.

433
00:25:24.213 --> 00:25:26.454
That is if we continue to try hard.

434
00:25:26.783 --> 00:25:28.723
I guess she's really...

435
00:25:28.723 --> 00:25:31.053
done with their son.

436
00:25:32.194 --> 00:25:34.894
I am going to visit Dad with Ji Soo one day.

437
00:25:35.164 --> 00:25:37.993
I think that would be the best medicine for him.

438
00:25:38.664 --> 00:25:40.404
I have something to say too.

439
00:25:42.334 --> 00:25:45.273
Mom. It's about Soo A.

440
00:25:45.374 --> 00:25:48.904
Didn't you say she's gone training?

441
00:25:49.444 --> 00:25:52.513
She doesn't have to worry about calling me.

442
00:25:53.184 --> 00:25:55.114
It's getting late.

443
00:25:55.783 --> 00:25:57.483
You should all rest.

444
00:26:00.053 --> 00:26:01.084
Ji An,

445
00:26:01.983 --> 00:26:03.354
thank you for coming home.

446
00:26:05.553 --> 00:26:07.963
What's wrong with Mom?

447
00:26:08.394 --> 00:26:09.834
Did something happen to you?

448
00:26:17.773 --> 00:26:19.704
I missed you, Dex.

449
00:26:21.904 --> 00:26:23.213
I missed you too.

450
00:26:26.584 --> 00:26:28.414
Hey, you're home.

451
00:26:30.384 --> 00:26:31.884
What's that on your hair?

452
00:26:31.884 --> 00:26:33.523
You got a big piece of dust on your hair.

453
00:26:34.323 --> 00:26:36.253
You've got some on your clothes too.

454
00:26:36.253 --> 00:26:38.194
What did you do at the factory?

455
00:26:38.594 --> 00:26:40.664
I think I should do the questioning instead.

456
00:26:41.223 --> 00:26:43.293
What were you two doing sitting there together?

457
00:26:43.934 --> 00:26:46.334
We were watching a movie in an open space.

458
00:26:46.733 --> 00:26:48.904
Don't stay together after 10pm.

459
00:26:50.573 --> 00:26:52.003
You're so strict.

460
00:26:53.104 --> 00:26:54.944
If you stay in one of your rooms together,

461
00:26:54.944 --> 00:26:56.213
you will get a yellow card right away.

462
00:26:56.543 --> 00:26:57.874
And you will get kicked out.

463
00:26:58.874 --> 00:27:01.543
Do Kyung, we are not that close.

464
00:27:01.543 --> 00:27:05.013
Come on. It's past 11pm. Go back to your rooms.

465
00:27:05.483 --> 00:27:07.684
- Goodnight, Ji Soo. - Goodnight, Hyuk.

466
00:27:18.134 --> 00:27:20.664
Father, what brings you here at this hour?

467
00:27:20.963 --> 00:27:22.303
I can't sleep.

468
00:27:22.303 --> 00:27:23.533
I didn't think I'll be able to sleep anyway,

469
00:27:23.533 --> 00:27:24.573
so I thought I'd come here.

470
00:27:29.973 --> 00:27:33.243
Everyone must be sleeping well here.

471
00:27:41.223 --> 00:27:43.793
Is this rice or gravel?

472
00:27:45.993 --> 00:27:47.194
Make me porridge.

473
00:27:47.293 --> 00:27:48.394
All right, sir.

474
00:27:56.473 --> 00:27:59.573
You must still be very healthy.

475
00:27:59.573 --> 00:28:01.043
You have a good appetite.

476
00:28:01.644 --> 00:28:04.013
They say breakfast is most important for you.

477
00:28:06.644 --> 00:28:08.243
Since you have so much energy,

478
00:28:08.243 --> 00:28:09.783
go get Do Kyung.

479
00:28:12.624 --> 00:28:14.854
Since when did this family...

480
00:28:15.454 --> 00:28:17.493
become like a middle-class family...

481
00:28:17.493 --> 00:28:19.664
where everyone does as they please?

482
00:28:20.924 --> 00:28:21.924
Is our family...

483
00:28:22.733 --> 00:28:24.134
an ordinary family?

484
00:28:24.864 --> 00:28:26.864
You are part of Haesung Corporation.

485
00:28:27.204 --> 00:28:30.104
But without consulting with me at all...

486
00:28:30.104 --> 00:28:32.473
Right, she's your daughter and my granddaughter.

487
00:28:34.243 --> 00:28:36.773
You used your prerogative as her father...

488
00:28:37.674 --> 00:28:40.444
to let Ji Soo leave.

489
00:28:41.983 --> 00:28:44.154
So bring Do Kyung back.

490
00:28:45.783 --> 00:28:48.454
Even you couldn't bring him back.

491
00:28:48.454 --> 00:28:49.793
So how could I bring him back?

492
00:28:49.793 --> 00:28:51.154
I am not confident about that, sir.

493
00:28:53.463 --> 00:28:54.594
Did you think...

494
00:28:55.063 --> 00:28:58.293
I would tell you to grab him by his collar?

495
00:29:00.134 --> 00:29:03.233
I already laid the foundation.

496
00:29:03.233 --> 00:29:05.773
I already went to Tae Soo and scared him enough.

497
00:29:06.073 --> 00:29:08.104
You went to that house?

498
00:29:09.543 --> 00:29:11.414
What did you do there?

499
00:29:11.543 --> 00:29:13.114
I hit him just two times.

500
00:29:13.614 --> 00:29:15.713
You hit him?

501
00:29:18.614 --> 00:29:20.723
Ji An must've hear it through her parents.

502
00:29:20.723 --> 00:29:24.124
She would then tell Do Kyung about it.

503
00:29:25.253 --> 00:29:27.963
After hearing about what you did for Ji Soo,

504
00:29:27.963 --> 00:29:30.594
Do Kyung would go to you for help.

505
00:29:30.763 --> 00:29:32.404
He wouldn't dare to come to me.

506
00:29:32.404 --> 00:29:34.763
From my understanding, they're not dating.

507
00:29:34.763 --> 00:29:38.473
So confirm it with him, and bring back Do Kyung.

508
00:29:43.043 --> 00:29:45.573
Why are you so soft? This is so unmanly.

509
00:29:48.414 --> 00:29:49.414
My gosh.

510
00:29:50.414 --> 00:29:52.483
My bronchial tubes and lungs are in bad shape,

511
00:29:52.483 --> 00:29:54.323
but how could I step down from this?

512
00:29:57.793 --> 00:30:01.194
I must see my company become a Top 10 business.

513
00:30:14.874 --> 00:30:15.944
Ji An.

514
00:30:18.374 --> 00:30:19.543
Do Kyung.

515
00:30:21.983 --> 00:30:23.154
You're wearing the same clothes,

516
00:30:23.154 --> 00:30:24.483
so I thought you were Ji An.

517
00:30:25.684 --> 00:30:29.053
I don't have my clothes, so Ji An left some for me.

518
00:30:30.023 --> 00:30:31.124
I see.

519
00:30:31.454 --> 00:30:33.094
I have to go to work.

520
00:30:36.164 --> 00:30:37.763
Why did he come to the kitchen?

521
00:30:46.303 --> 00:30:48.743
"Dad, aren't you coming to Seoul?"

522
00:30:48.973 --> 00:30:50.644
"Please call me when you do."

523
00:30:54.043 --> 00:30:56.354
Why wouldn't he tell me about Ji Soo?

524
00:30:57.654 --> 00:30:59.084
(Ji An)

525
00:31:02.354 --> 00:31:03.354
Ji An.

526
00:31:03.354 --> 00:31:04.854
You answered so quickly.

527
00:31:05.053 --> 00:31:06.563
Were you waiting for my call?

528
00:31:07.864 --> 00:31:11.934
No, I just got off the phone.

529
00:31:12.834 --> 00:31:15.204
Then I'll tell you about Ji Soo first.

530
00:31:15.263 --> 00:31:18.303
Ji Soo's father solved all her problems.

531
00:31:18.374 --> 00:31:19.604
She will stay in the shared house...

532
00:31:19.604 --> 00:31:21.003
and continue working at the bakery.

533
00:31:21.543 --> 00:31:23.313
He even let her date her boyfriend.

534
00:31:24.174 --> 00:31:25.313
Is... Is that right?

535
00:31:25.813 --> 00:31:28.344
How did he let her do all that?

536
00:31:29.053 --> 00:31:30.584
I know. I'm surprised too.

537
00:31:31.053 --> 00:31:32.584
That family is impossible.

538
00:31:33.854 --> 00:31:35.354
What... what about you?

539
00:31:35.854 --> 00:31:37.194
Are you okay?

540
00:31:37.723 --> 00:31:38.924
What about me?

541
00:31:39.664 --> 00:31:40.993
You mean that guy?

542
00:31:41.263 --> 00:31:42.694
Of course I am okay.

543
00:31:42.894 --> 00:31:45.334
I only liked him a little bit.

544
00:31:45.334 --> 00:31:47.404
And I'm not that slow.

545
00:31:47.404 --> 00:31:49.174
I don't hope for something I can't have.

546
00:31:49.604 --> 00:31:51.374
I'm done with him for good.

547
00:31:51.934 --> 00:31:53.174
So don't worry.

548
00:31:56.213 --> 00:31:58.073
Dad, I called you on my way to work.

549
00:31:59.213 --> 00:32:01.513
All right. I'll hang up then.

550
00:32:23.334 --> 00:32:27.174
I am going home today. Will you wait for me?

551
00:32:29.043 --> 00:32:31.444
It's something to do with my grandson, Do Kyung.

552
00:32:34.644 --> 00:32:37.684
I don't know if it's love or attachment.

553
00:32:39.424 --> 00:32:40.884
But something that should never happen...

554
00:32:40.884 --> 00:32:42.424
is happening right now.

555
00:32:43.993 --> 00:32:46.194
No... No way.

556
00:32:46.924 --> 00:32:48.624
She's a witch.

557
00:32:48.624 --> 00:32:51.063
The way she handles men is unbelievable.

558
00:32:52.763 --> 00:32:54.463
That... That's nonsense.

559
00:33:02.187 --> 00:33:07.187
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E43 My Golden Life "Do You Want to Fight Me?"</font>
<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

560
00:33:16.823 --> 00:33:19.094
It's something to do with my grandson, Do Kyung.

561
00:33:19.523 --> 00:33:21.023
Something that should never happen...

562
00:33:21.023 --> 00:33:22.434
is happening right now.

563
00:33:37.243 --> 00:33:38.444
Dad.

564
00:33:39.513 --> 00:33:40.844
Your shoes are here.

565
00:33:41.914 --> 00:33:43.483
You're sleeping.

566
00:33:43.684 --> 00:33:44.884
It's so cold.

567
00:33:50.424 --> 00:33:52.763
Why did you come again?

568
00:33:53.894 --> 00:33:55.694
I felt upset, but I had nowhere to go.

569
00:33:58.134 --> 00:34:00.404
Should I just be a farmer in the countryside?

570
00:34:02.134 --> 00:34:05.704
Hey, you're still young. Losing 5,000 dollars...

571
00:34:05.704 --> 00:34:07.774
means nothing. Why would you talk such nonsense?

572
00:34:08.443 --> 00:34:10.774
Well, that's one thing.

573
00:34:11.374 --> 00:34:13.314
But it turns out I am not a good businessman.

574
00:34:14.013 --> 00:34:16.684
I tried selling clothes on the streets.

575
00:34:17.184 --> 00:34:18.414
But I am terrible at it.

576
00:34:19.153 --> 00:34:21.223
I want to do business, but I am not fit for it.

577
00:34:21.383 --> 00:34:23.093
So I'd be just wasting money.

578
00:34:23.593 --> 00:34:25.193
You don't need skills.

579
00:34:25.863 --> 00:34:27.164
Then what do I need?

580
00:34:27.164 --> 00:34:29.394
You need a heart, you brat.

581
00:34:30.834 --> 00:34:32.803
How can I do business with a heart?

582
00:34:34.303 --> 00:34:35.303
Right.

583
00:34:35.673 --> 00:34:37.334
You were a businessman.

584
00:34:38.033 --> 00:34:39.843
You sold bath towels in Middle East...

585
00:34:39.843 --> 00:34:41.274
and earned 10,000 dollars.

586
00:34:41.774 --> 00:34:43.513
You were on the newspapers for that.

587
00:34:44.774 --> 00:34:46.214
I... I used to do that.

588
00:34:47.214 --> 00:34:50.214
Dad, how did you sell those in the Middle East?

589
00:34:50.854 --> 00:34:52.113
Tell me about it.

590
00:34:54.923 --> 00:34:56.693
You can't let your customers...

591
00:34:56.894 --> 00:35:00.263
find out that you are just trying...

592
00:35:00.263 --> 00:35:02.434
to make them buy your goods.

593
00:35:02.633 --> 00:35:04.734
For example, let's say you're selling clothes.

594
00:35:04.734 --> 00:35:06.363
If you tell them they look good in anything,

595
00:35:06.363 --> 00:35:08.004
they would know your intention.

596
00:35:08.504 --> 00:35:09.633
Do they really?

597
00:35:09.834 --> 00:35:11.334
Of course they do.

598
00:35:11.673 --> 00:35:13.874
They know what looks good...

599
00:35:13.874 --> 00:35:15.604
and what looks bad on themselves.

600
00:35:15.843 --> 00:35:17.173
Be honest.

601
00:35:17.314 --> 00:35:19.613
You have to help them as if you're helping...

602
00:35:19.613 --> 00:35:20.783
your family buy things.

603
00:35:23.283 --> 00:35:24.684
How did you do it, Dad?

604
00:35:25.184 --> 00:35:27.524
(Whoever House)

605
00:35:57.954 --> 00:35:59.053
Hey.

606
00:35:59.783 --> 00:36:01.854
The fact that he's telling his parents everything...

607
00:36:02.854 --> 00:36:05.524
means that he's made up his mind, right?

608
00:36:07.624 --> 00:36:11.093
So why did you bring up the divorce issue?

609
00:36:11.863 --> 00:36:14.533
Well, I'm glad that I did.

610
00:36:16.073 --> 00:36:18.204
He immediately chose the child over me.

611
00:36:19.544 --> 00:36:21.104
I was surprised too.

612
00:36:21.803 --> 00:36:24.314
As I watched you two dating for four years,

613
00:36:24.314 --> 00:36:25.443
I envied you.

614
00:36:25.714 --> 00:36:28.013
Ji Tae was so loyal to you.

615
00:36:28.743 --> 00:36:31.153
How could he change right after you got married?

616
00:36:33.354 --> 00:36:34.754
He changed, right?

617
00:36:34.984 --> 00:36:36.223
However,

618
00:36:36.524 --> 00:36:40.294
if Ji Tae really chose the child over you,

619
00:36:40.723 --> 00:36:42.533
you shouldn't have the baby.

620
00:36:44.934 --> 00:36:46.564
If I don't have the baby,

621
00:36:46.834 --> 00:36:48.204
he won't divorce me.

622
00:36:48.303 --> 00:36:49.633
How can he say that?

623
00:36:50.173 --> 00:36:51.934
What if the baby doesn't exist anymore?

624
00:36:52.743 --> 00:36:53.743
What?

625
00:37:24.473 --> 00:37:26.774
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

626
00:37:26.903 --> 00:37:29.013
Thank you, girls.

627
00:37:29.644 --> 00:37:31.943
I can't believe I'm living to see this day.

628
00:37:32.343 --> 00:37:33.714
I am so overwhelmed.

629
00:37:35.184 --> 00:37:39.383
Ji An made me earrings and a necklace.

630
00:37:40.383 --> 00:37:42.323
We've been worried too.

631
00:37:42.394 --> 00:37:44.193
You spent three years preparing for this exam.

632
00:37:44.193 --> 00:37:46.064
We were worried that you'd fail again.

633
00:37:46.263 --> 00:37:48.024
Do you know how uncomfortable it is...

634
00:37:48.024 --> 00:37:49.834
if a friend is unemployed?

635
00:37:50.093 --> 00:37:51.464
Come on, Min Kyung.

636
00:37:53.164 --> 00:37:54.464
I am sorry, Ji An.

637
00:37:54.633 --> 00:37:55.774
About what?

638
00:37:57.204 --> 00:37:58.834
I am not unemployed.

639
00:37:59.173 --> 00:38:00.604
I heard you are doing a part-time job...

640
00:38:00.604 --> 00:38:01.943
at a woodworking studio.

641
00:38:02.044 --> 00:38:03.573
Still, I make money.

642
00:38:03.573 --> 00:38:05.214
As long as I can afford living, I'm fine.

643
00:38:05.613 --> 00:38:08.314
Why don't you take the civil service exam?

644
00:38:08.383 --> 00:38:10.084
You're smart,

645
00:38:10.084 --> 00:38:11.254
and you always had good grades.

646
00:38:11.254 --> 00:38:12.923
You will pass in just a year.

647
00:38:13.084 --> 00:38:14.854
You should prepare being a level seven officer.

648
00:38:15.283 --> 00:38:17.354
I get bored easily, so it doesn't suit me.

649
00:38:17.354 --> 00:38:19.664
Why did you suddenly quit Haesung Apparel?

650
00:38:19.664 --> 00:38:21.064
You had finally become a regular employee.

651
00:38:21.064 --> 00:38:23.193
- She didn't like it. - "Didn't like it"?

652
00:38:23.493 --> 00:38:25.964
You suffered for years to get into a big company.

653
00:38:25.964 --> 00:38:28.104
How can you not like it now?

654
00:38:28.734 --> 00:38:30.173
You're not saying you like working...

655
00:38:30.173 --> 00:38:31.903
in the wood working studio, are you?

656
00:38:31.903 --> 00:38:33.504
I love wood.

657
00:38:33.903 --> 00:38:36.314
Didn't I do such a good job?

658
00:38:36.513 --> 00:38:38.843
I might work with wood for the rest of my life.

659
00:38:38.843 --> 00:38:40.484
Then how will you get married?

660
00:38:40.544 --> 00:38:42.383
Nowadays, it's hard to get married...

661
00:38:42.383 --> 00:38:43.684
if you don't have a proper job.

662
00:38:43.684 --> 00:38:45.314
But still, you got married.

663
00:38:45.553 --> 00:38:47.923
My husband is a doctor, so he earns well.

664
00:38:47.923 --> 00:38:49.153
And his family is well-off too.

665
00:38:51.024 --> 00:38:53.263
Is that why you go to his parents'...

666
00:38:53.263 --> 00:38:54.394
every Sunday and cook?

667
00:38:54.493 --> 00:38:55.934
Even if you are eight months pregnant.

668
00:38:56.033 --> 00:38:57.394
They bought us a house in Gangnam.

669
00:38:57.394 --> 00:38:58.834
How could I not do that?

670
00:38:58.834 --> 00:39:00.564
Stop it, girls.

671
00:39:00.834 --> 00:39:03.033
There must be someone perfect for me.

672
00:39:03.204 --> 00:39:05.173
He won't mind whether I am a carpenter,

673
00:39:05.173 --> 00:39:06.274
a craftsman, or a designer.

674
00:39:06.644 --> 00:39:07.673
Cheers.

675
00:39:10.414 --> 00:39:12.243
It's not even for industrial use.

676
00:39:12.243 --> 00:39:14.743
You want to run a small business for cats?

677
00:39:15.954 --> 00:39:17.254
Look at you.

678
00:39:17.954 --> 00:39:19.553
You can't snort at me unless...

679
00:39:19.653 --> 00:39:23.093
you start a business with nothing like I did.

680
00:39:23.423 --> 00:39:25.294
If you weren't the son of Sungho Corporation,

681
00:39:25.294 --> 00:39:26.863
what could have you done?

682
00:39:26.964 --> 00:39:29.863
I'd never leave my family.

683
00:39:29.863 --> 00:39:31.934
Then keep your mouth shut.

684
00:39:32.064 --> 00:39:33.664
You can do all that...

685
00:39:33.803 --> 00:39:35.934
because you have somewhere to return to.

686
00:39:37.204 --> 00:39:38.434
Do you really think so?

687
00:39:38.704 --> 00:39:39.743
No.

688
00:39:40.303 --> 00:39:41.803
Actually, I don't know.

689
00:39:42.343 --> 00:39:43.914
I can't read your mind anymore.

690
00:39:44.013 --> 00:39:45.144
I guess you can't.

691
00:39:45.943 --> 00:39:47.984
You can't look into it when you're in there.

692
00:39:48.084 --> 00:39:49.414
What does that mean?

693
00:39:49.484 --> 00:39:50.954
My family looks different from the outside...

694
00:39:51.584 --> 00:39:54.723
from the way it seemed from the inside.

695
00:39:55.184 --> 00:39:58.454
You can see the woods only from the outside?

696
00:39:59.894 --> 00:40:01.093
I'm talking about Ji Soo.

697
00:40:02.394 --> 00:40:03.734
When they tried to introduce her...

698
00:40:03.734 --> 00:40:05.294
as Ji An at the anniversary event,

699
00:40:06.504 --> 00:40:07.964
I was a little surprised,

700
00:40:08.834 --> 00:40:10.303
but I didn't know what it was like.

701
00:40:11.234 --> 00:40:13.573
I just thought they had no choice...

702
00:40:13.903 --> 00:40:15.104
for the company.

703
00:40:16.044 --> 00:40:19.113
But it was ridiculous.

704
00:40:20.584 --> 00:40:22.144
They tried to introduce her as someone else...

705
00:40:22.144 --> 00:40:23.714
just to save the face of the family.

706
00:40:25.454 --> 00:40:26.984
It's was just wrong.

707
00:40:27.053 --> 00:40:30.053
They often sacrifice the lesser for the greater.

708
00:40:30.254 --> 00:40:32.294
I don't know about the industrial logic.

709
00:40:33.394 --> 00:40:34.894
But she's my family.

710
00:40:34.894 --> 00:40:37.863
You ran away from home to win Ji An's heart,

711
00:40:37.863 --> 00:40:40.834
but you only learned about humanism.

712
00:40:41.604 --> 00:40:43.834
It doesn't help you run a business.

713
00:40:43.834 --> 00:40:45.803
Don't talk about Ji An.

714
00:40:47.144 --> 00:40:48.343
I miss her.

715
00:40:49.414 --> 00:40:51.144
- Cheers. - Cheers.

716
00:40:54.214 --> 00:40:56.513
So did you meet him at the training institute?

717
00:40:56.513 --> 00:40:57.513
Yes.

718
00:40:58.584 --> 00:41:01.584
It turns out we went to the same academy.

719
00:41:02.653 --> 00:41:06.493
We could've brushed past each other 10 times.

720
00:41:06.524 --> 00:41:10.334
Gosh, it's so lame but somewhat romantic.

721
00:41:10.633 --> 00:41:12.033
I'm sure you didn't brush past each other only.

722
00:41:12.033 --> 00:41:13.834
I guess your eyes could've met a few times too.

723
00:41:13.834 --> 00:41:15.104
You think so?

724
00:41:19.704 --> 00:41:20.704
I envy you.

725
00:41:21.374 --> 00:41:23.013
Good for you, Myung Shin.

726
00:41:26.314 --> 00:41:27.414
Ji An.

727
00:41:28.343 --> 00:41:32.113
People usually have a weakness for love.

728
00:41:33.124 --> 00:41:34.223
Of course I know...

729
00:41:34.223 --> 00:41:36.124
why you can't be with Do Kyung.

730
00:41:36.754 --> 00:41:39.394
But whenever I hear about your story...

731
00:41:40.363 --> 00:41:44.133
I mean, don't you even feel weak?

732
00:41:44.894 --> 00:41:46.604
I feel so weak.

733
00:41:47.734 --> 00:41:48.803
It's really hard...

734
00:41:48.803 --> 00:41:50.704
to push him away from my mind.

735
00:41:51.633 --> 00:41:54.204
But everything is over now.

736
00:41:54.973 --> 00:41:58.613
Do Kyung could shelter you from everything.

737
00:41:58.613 --> 00:42:01.414
His father, the vice chairman.

738
00:42:01.914 --> 00:42:04.153
He was the eldest son of an ordinary family.

739
00:42:04.484 --> 00:42:06.484
But he can't even hold a memorial service...

740
00:42:06.484 --> 00:42:08.553
for his ancestors on holidays.

741
00:42:08.553 --> 00:42:10.093
He can't even visit his ancestors' graves.

742
00:42:10.923 --> 00:42:12.823
He said that's what he's supposed to do.

743
00:42:13.464 --> 00:42:16.133
All decisions are up to Ms. No or Chairman No.

744
00:42:16.133 --> 00:42:17.193
My gosh.

745
00:42:17.834 --> 00:42:21.334
That means Do Kyung's wife can't do anything.

746
00:42:21.734 --> 00:42:23.734
You'd have to do as you're told.

747
00:42:24.573 --> 00:42:27.204
I want to love myself before someone else.

748
00:42:27.204 --> 00:42:29.243
I can't rush into something...

749
00:42:29.243 --> 00:42:30.644
giving up on my everything.

750
00:42:30.843 --> 00:42:32.343
And the same applies to him too.

751
00:42:39.754 --> 00:42:42.254
Is he Jung Soo? Your boyfriend.

752
00:42:44.854 --> 00:42:47.263
I wish he were like your boyfriend.

753
00:42:48.923 --> 00:42:50.593
If he were...

754
00:42:51.863 --> 00:42:56.173
If Do Kyung were an ordinary office worker...

755
00:42:56.903 --> 00:42:58.133
Or if he were...

756
00:42:58.133 --> 00:43:01.374
an ordinary person who runs his business...

757
00:43:03.314 --> 00:43:04.644
If he were?

758
00:43:05.814 --> 00:43:09.414
I would've gone to his office...

759
00:43:09.484 --> 00:43:10.684
right after work.

760
00:43:11.684 --> 00:43:14.783
I could help him with his presentation.

761
00:43:14.854 --> 00:43:18.093
We could go out for a beer after work.

762
00:43:18.423 --> 00:43:21.564
If he met someone bad at work,

763
00:43:21.564 --> 00:43:23.133
I'd join him complaining about that person.

764
00:43:23.693 --> 00:43:26.604
I'd tell him what I made...

765
00:43:26.734 --> 00:43:28.834
or what I did that day.

766
00:43:29.434 --> 00:43:33.073
And he'd praise me for my work.

767
00:43:35.004 --> 00:43:36.073
Stuff like that.

768
00:43:37.013 --> 00:43:39.684
I just want to share...

769
00:43:39.684 --> 00:43:42.613
little things about our lives.

770
00:43:43.113 --> 00:43:45.754
Sometimes we'd laugh or get angry,

771
00:43:46.053 --> 00:43:47.584
but we'd eventually make up.

772
00:43:50.754 --> 00:43:52.823
We could've done that.

773
00:43:54.564 --> 00:43:57.434
If you marry Do Kyung,

774
00:43:57.834 --> 00:44:00.704
can you never do any of that?

775
00:44:00.704 --> 00:44:02.803
Of course not.

776
00:44:02.803 --> 00:44:05.104
His family wouldn't even let me date him.

777
00:44:06.704 --> 00:44:08.473
Call me when you get home.

778
00:44:30.394 --> 00:44:32.303
Gosh, why am I here?

779
00:45:31.593 --> 00:45:33.323
Put some eggs on it.

780
00:45:33.363 --> 00:45:36.064
- And squeeze the ketchup. - Squeeze it a lot.

781
00:45:36.193 --> 00:45:37.533
Good.

782
00:45:37.894 --> 00:45:40.434
A heart? And a lot of mustard.

783
00:45:41.064 --> 00:45:42.334
It's like a penalty.

784
00:45:43.633 --> 00:45:46.403
It will be good. It's done.

785
00:45:46.903 --> 00:45:48.403
It feels like we're playing house.

786
00:45:48.403 --> 00:45:50.544
It's good to make breakfast together.

787
00:45:50.573 --> 00:45:53.343
It must be good since you made it.

788
00:45:56.214 --> 00:45:59.184
What are you doing here together again?

789
00:45:59.754 --> 00:46:01.124
We made yours too.

790
00:46:02.184 --> 00:46:03.254
Really?

791
00:46:03.894 --> 00:46:05.553
You should do that.

792
00:46:06.664 --> 00:46:08.223
You can enjoy it alone together.

793
00:46:08.223 --> 00:46:10.164
What? You don't have to do that.

794
00:46:15.533 --> 00:46:16.573
Ji An.

795
00:46:19.104 --> 00:46:20.173
Do Kyung.

796
00:46:22.414 --> 00:46:25.144
He cared for Ji An a lot...

797
00:46:25.144 --> 00:46:26.343
as her brother.

798
00:46:27.013 --> 00:46:28.613
They worked together at the company back then,

799
00:46:28.613 --> 00:46:29.854
so they were together all the time.

800
00:46:33.984 --> 00:46:35.723
That's when he started to change.

801
00:46:36.894 --> 00:46:39.363
He changed after Ji An came to our house.

802
00:46:41.223 --> 00:46:42.633
What are you thinking about?

803
00:46:45.033 --> 00:46:46.033
Hyuk.

804
00:46:49.033 --> 00:46:51.604
I kind of have a weird feeling.

805
00:46:51.604 --> 00:46:54.004
I know it is ridiculous, but...

806
00:46:55.104 --> 00:46:56.544
What is it? Tell me.

807
00:46:57.113 --> 00:46:58.644
It's about Do Kyung.

808
00:46:59.184 --> 00:47:01.084
He left home while saying he wants his life back.

809
00:47:01.343 --> 00:47:02.783
I didn't understand...

810
00:47:02.783 --> 00:47:05.084
why he struggled so hard with no money.

811
00:47:06.653 --> 00:47:08.153
Are you sure...

812
00:47:09.124 --> 00:47:12.564
he coincidentally ran into Ji An again here?

813
00:47:32.113 --> 00:47:34.283
This is a total emergency.

814
00:47:34.283 --> 00:47:37.584
You and I being friends? That's just not right.

815
00:47:38.653 --> 00:47:40.954
How could he cut me out just like that?

816
00:47:42.153 --> 00:47:44.093
We've become pretty close so far.

817
00:47:49.464 --> 00:47:50.493
Do Kyung.

818
00:47:50.493 --> 00:47:53.104
Seo Hyun, can you pack Ji Soo's clothes...

819
00:47:53.104 --> 00:47:54.403
left in her room?

820
00:47:55.164 --> 00:47:58.374
By the way, what are you going to do?

821
00:47:58.374 --> 00:48:00.403
What's going on with Ji An?

822
00:48:00.874 --> 00:48:04.473
Grandfather even went to Ji An's parents.

823
00:48:05.314 --> 00:48:06.343
What?

824
00:48:07.414 --> 00:48:09.484
What is wrong with you?

825
00:48:10.184 --> 00:48:12.423
Come back to your senses, and come back home.

826
00:48:21.164 --> 00:48:22.564
Do Kyung is here?

827
00:48:23.193 --> 00:48:24.193
Yes.

828
00:48:25.033 --> 00:48:27.204
He directly came to see me?

829
00:48:55.294 --> 00:48:56.464
Grandfather.

830
00:48:57.693 --> 00:49:00.234
I couldn't go to Hawaii because of you.

831
00:49:01.964 --> 00:49:03.403
I spent two months here.

832
00:49:05.473 --> 00:49:07.243
I drink this tea instead of medicine, so wait.

833
00:49:08.144 --> 00:49:09.774
Please hear me out first.

834
00:49:12.044 --> 00:49:13.214
You can answer...

835
00:49:13.343 --> 00:49:15.343
after you finish your tea.

836
00:49:19.653 --> 00:49:21.223
I heard you went to Ji An's home.

837
00:49:22.323 --> 00:49:23.593
Why did you go there?

838
00:49:27.723 --> 00:49:29.593
You didn't come home.

839
00:49:29.593 --> 00:49:33.133
Why did you go to her home because I didn't return?

840
00:49:33.863 --> 00:49:35.363
We aren't dating.

841
00:49:35.363 --> 00:49:36.774
That's the thing.

842
00:49:38.374 --> 00:49:41.673
Ji An said nothing's going on between you two.

843
00:49:43.044 --> 00:49:44.774
You said you're over her.

844
00:49:45.343 --> 00:49:47.013
Then you must come home.

845
00:49:47.214 --> 00:49:50.984
If you don't come home, it means you're lying.

846
00:49:53.184 --> 00:49:55.454
So I gave them a warning.

847
00:49:55.954 --> 00:49:56.993
Grandpa.

848
00:49:56.993 --> 00:50:00.223
You even worked together to take away Ji Soo.

849
00:50:02.734 --> 00:50:03.763
For Ji An to pull off...

850
00:50:03.964 --> 00:50:07.064
something like that against our family...

851
00:50:07.964 --> 00:50:11.673
only means that you have her back.

852
00:50:11.774 --> 00:50:14.704
She did it because she loves her sister.

853
00:50:14.704 --> 00:50:16.874
Then you can come home.

854
00:50:19.343 --> 00:50:21.343
If you two aren't dating,

855
00:50:23.414 --> 00:50:24.814
you must come home.

856
00:50:26.484 --> 00:50:28.024
Only that would prove it.

857
00:50:29.423 --> 00:50:30.794
But you didn't.

858
00:50:32.323 --> 00:50:34.693
That means you and Ji An are lying.

859
00:50:36.493 --> 00:50:37.794
Then do you think...

860
00:50:38.934 --> 00:50:40.664
that this time,

861
00:50:41.133 --> 00:50:44.033
I will stop at slapping Seo Tae Soo?

862
00:50:46.774 --> 00:50:48.073
Did you hit...

863
00:50:50.274 --> 00:50:51.314
Ji An's father?

864
00:50:53.644 --> 00:50:55.684
Didn't she tell you?

865
00:50:56.013 --> 00:50:57.814
I didn't hear it from her.

866
00:50:57.814 --> 00:50:59.053
I don't care.

867
00:51:01.184 --> 00:51:04.193
I hit him twice and gave a stern warning.

868
00:51:05.093 --> 00:51:06.823
I guess you threatened him...

869
00:51:08.024 --> 00:51:09.434
to harm his family.

870
00:51:11.434 --> 00:51:12.434
Just like Mom.

871
00:51:15.234 --> 00:51:17.874
You're the one who made me do something...

872
00:51:17.874 --> 00:51:19.704
so uncultured, Do Kyung.

873
00:51:19.803 --> 00:51:21.044
Seo Ji An!

874
00:51:22.473 --> 00:51:24.013
Yes, Seo Ji An.

875
00:51:25.113 --> 00:51:26.743
I told you that I won't bring her home.

876
00:51:26.843 --> 00:51:29.283
I don't want us to live in this kind of household.

877
00:51:29.814 --> 00:51:30.814
What?

878
00:51:32.084 --> 00:51:34.684
You're concerned that I'll marry her.

879
00:51:36.193 --> 00:51:37.524
Don't worry, Grandpa.

880
00:51:40.223 --> 00:51:41.693
I won't marry Ji An.

881
00:51:42.464 --> 00:51:43.894
I will never.

882
00:51:44.664 --> 00:51:47.133
I won't because we can't live like this.

883
00:51:49.073 --> 00:51:50.234
What?

884
00:51:53.004 --> 00:51:54.044
And...

885
00:51:56.044 --> 00:51:57.573
I won't come back either.

886
00:51:59.084 --> 00:52:01.084
I won't come back regardless of Ji An.

887
00:52:01.783 --> 00:52:02.783
What...

888
00:52:04.783 --> 00:52:06.254
do you mean?

889
00:52:06.484 --> 00:52:08.383
I haven't tried running my business yet.

890
00:52:10.394 --> 00:52:12.093
I haven't yet lived my own life either.

891
00:52:16.064 --> 00:52:17.093
You've decided...

892
00:52:19.434 --> 00:52:21.803
not to obey my orders now.

893
00:52:27.374 --> 00:52:29.113
Do you want to fight me?

894
00:52:30.314 --> 00:52:31.374
I'm no longer...

895
00:52:32.984 --> 00:52:36.283
your puppy, Grandpa.

896
00:52:42.723 --> 00:52:45.923
I'm good at usual household chores.

897
00:52:46.564 --> 00:52:49.263
I also worked as a franchise manager.

898
00:52:49.734 --> 00:52:51.263
Which franchise?

899
00:52:52.863 --> 00:52:55.434
A store that sells burgers.

900
00:52:56.673 --> 00:52:58.434
You want to work?

901
00:52:59.374 --> 00:53:02.073
Yes, I'm going to work...

902
00:53:02.513 --> 00:53:05.013
to support Tae Soo when he comes home.

903
00:53:05.883 --> 00:53:07.084
Are you serious?

904
00:53:07.283 --> 00:53:10.283
Wouldn't I be when my husband's like that?

905
00:53:11.513 --> 00:53:13.783
I was ignorant and practically blind.

906
00:53:14.454 --> 00:53:16.993
Since I know that now, I can't turn a blind eye.

907
00:53:17.894 --> 00:53:20.024
Even when Tae Soo was poor and struggling,

908
00:53:20.024 --> 00:53:21.894
you said you were too weak to work.

909
00:53:24.763 --> 00:53:27.934
Do you know what he kept saying to me...

910
00:53:28.434 --> 00:53:30.434
after he thought he had cancer?

911
00:53:32.234 --> 00:53:35.274
He told me not to burden the kids.

912
00:53:36.314 --> 00:53:38.173
That broke my heart.

913
00:53:40.214 --> 00:53:42.013
By the way, Mi Jung.

914
00:53:42.684 --> 00:53:45.613
Didn't you have a guest when I last visited?

915
00:53:48.383 --> 00:53:52.493
The old man who looked really rich.

916
00:53:53.763 --> 00:53:55.693
Why was he here?

917
00:53:55.794 --> 00:53:58.794
What business would a rich man have here?

918
00:53:59.403 --> 00:54:01.863
Why did you come over anyway?

919
00:54:02.633 --> 00:54:04.934
Well, to ask you to come shopping with me.

920
00:54:05.104 --> 00:54:08.303
Seok Doo's in distribution thanks to Tae Soo.

921
00:54:08.473 --> 00:54:09.473
He's coming home again.

922
00:54:10.644 --> 00:54:13.883
You can't cancel the day we settle the balance.

923
00:54:14.243 --> 00:54:17.214
Someone offered to pay us double.

924
00:54:20.084 --> 00:54:22.693
This is for the breach of contract.

925
00:54:22.954 --> 00:54:24.423
I'm really sorry.

926
00:54:30.633 --> 00:54:34.464
May I ask who the other buyer is?

927
00:54:34.464 --> 00:54:36.704
His agent came by.

928
00:54:38.403 --> 00:54:40.973
It's Mr. No Yang Ho.

929
00:54:51.484 --> 00:54:52.684
Sir.

930
00:54:57.854 --> 00:54:59.223
I'm sorry.

931
00:55:01.394 --> 00:55:02.993
But I want to be alone today.

932
00:55:06.604 --> 00:55:08.204
I'm pretty impressed with Do Kyung.

933
00:55:08.434 --> 00:55:10.173
I didn't think he'd do this.

934
00:55:10.403 --> 00:55:12.573
He grew up so sheltered.

935
00:55:12.573 --> 00:55:14.243
It's not at all easy...

936
00:55:14.243 --> 00:55:15.874
to start from scratch.

937
00:55:17.013 --> 00:55:19.883
Do you think he changed after meeting Ji An?

938
00:55:20.283 --> 00:55:23.214
It's true that she's a positive influence.

939
00:55:23.553 --> 00:55:24.883
She was to me too.

940
00:55:27.484 --> 00:55:29.693
He'll need more waste wood when things get going.

941
00:55:30.423 --> 00:55:32.254
I should connect him to the Incheon lumber yard.

942
00:55:33.593 --> 00:55:35.164
Helping your future brother-in-law?

943
00:55:35.524 --> 00:55:38.664
He makes me want to help out.

944
00:55:39.633 --> 00:55:41.564
We should meet up after the contract's finalized.

945
00:55:42.204 --> 00:55:43.903
To buy him some beef.

946
00:55:59.484 --> 00:56:00.823
(Lee Yong Gook)

947
00:56:04.524 --> 00:56:06.223
Hi, Yong Gook.

948
00:56:06.323 --> 00:56:09.763
You sound drunk. Are you celebrating already?

949
00:56:10.394 --> 00:56:13.004
No, I lost again.

950
00:56:13.734 --> 00:56:14.834
What?

951
00:56:14.934 --> 00:56:17.204
I guess he was watching me.

952
00:56:18.673 --> 00:56:21.774
He's determined to ruin whatever I do.

953
00:56:44.993 --> 00:56:48.334
Both Do Kyung and Ji An went through a lot.

954
00:56:49.374 --> 00:56:52.234
Ji An pushed him away, but Do Kyung couldn't give up.

955
00:56:57.973 --> 00:56:59.383
Ji An.

956
00:57:00.184 --> 00:57:01.283
Ji Soo.

957
00:57:03.854 --> 00:57:06.383
What is it? Is something wrong?

958
00:57:07.854 --> 00:57:10.653
What could be wrong with me?

959
00:57:10.854 --> 00:57:12.794
Everything's sorted out.

960
00:57:13.394 --> 00:57:15.093
You're the problem.

961
00:57:16.533 --> 00:57:20.064
You suffered so much because of my brother.

962
00:57:22.004 --> 00:57:25.173
You're driving me insane. Why didn't you tell me?

963
00:57:27.943 --> 00:57:31.613
You're too late. I didn't tell because it's over.

964
00:57:32.684 --> 00:57:35.243
Let's go and get some beer from a convenience store.

965
00:57:36.053 --> 00:57:38.854
No. I'm sick of convenience store beer.

966
00:57:39.254 --> 00:57:41.223
Then let's go to a bar instead.

967
00:57:42.993 --> 00:57:45.193
You both want to buy me a drink?

968
00:57:46.164 --> 00:57:48.093
But not today. Some other time.

969
00:57:48.093 --> 00:57:49.633
I want to finish this.

970
00:57:50.533 --> 00:57:52.633
A carving? Who is it?

971
00:57:52.903 --> 00:57:54.064
My dad.

972
00:57:54.234 --> 00:57:56.774
Can you sweep up the shavings then?

973
00:57:57.004 --> 00:57:58.803
Do Kyung will come for them tomorrow.

974
00:57:59.243 --> 00:58:03.473
He's supposed to settle the balance today. Did he?

975
00:58:03.573 --> 00:58:04.644
Don't call him.

976
00:58:04.743 --> 00:58:05.943
Why not?

977
00:58:06.214 --> 00:58:08.084
Chairman No's incredible.

978
00:58:08.383 --> 00:58:10.283
He bought the factory at the last minute.

979
00:58:12.923 --> 00:58:13.954
What?

980
00:58:16.323 --> 00:58:17.354
Again?

981
00:58:18.053 --> 00:58:19.363
He stopped it again?

982
00:58:21.024 --> 00:58:23.493
What for? Why? Why this time?

983
00:58:23.834 --> 00:58:25.564
I moved out of the share house...

984
00:58:25.564 --> 00:58:27.303
and we ended our...

985
00:58:27.734 --> 00:58:30.104
Do Kyung and I both gave up.

986
00:58:30.834 --> 00:58:32.743
How could he do that?

987
00:58:33.803 --> 00:58:35.104
Do Kyung can't go home...

988
00:58:35.104 --> 00:58:36.144
without accomplishing anything.

989
00:58:36.144 --> 00:58:37.943
He has his pride too.

990
00:58:37.943 --> 00:58:39.414
He's his grandson.

991
00:58:39.414 --> 00:58:41.883
Can't he at least protect his pride?

992
00:58:42.013 --> 00:58:44.854
Only then can Do Kyung feel dignified.

993
00:58:46.024 --> 00:58:47.254
How could he...

994
00:59:15.314 --> 00:59:16.553
If I return now,

995
00:59:17.254 --> 00:59:20.053
I must live like a spare part of Haesung.

996
00:59:20.124 --> 00:59:21.323
Forever.

997
00:59:22.084 --> 00:59:24.854
That's not the life I want.

998
00:59:27.363 --> 00:59:29.493
I won't go home until I'm independent.

999
00:59:31.033 --> 00:59:34.004
Seo Ji An. It's not about you anymore.

1000
01:00:06.964 --> 01:00:11.403
(Wood pellets)

1001
01:00:18.374 --> 01:00:20.314
What is it, Ji An?

1002
01:00:20.584 --> 01:00:22.613
Please pass this to Do Kyung.

1003
01:00:22.613 --> 01:00:25.013
I found a second-hand pellet machine for sale.

1004
01:00:25.013 --> 01:00:27.383
I did some research on what he can buy.

1005
01:00:27.783 --> 01:00:28.954
If he has a machine,

1006
01:00:28.954 --> 01:00:31.923
he just needs to find cheap factory space.

1007
01:00:31.923 --> 01:00:33.593
He already tested the idea...

1008
01:00:33.593 --> 01:00:35.124
and hired experienced workers.

1009
01:00:35.664 --> 01:00:39.064
Couldn't you just find him a factory?

1010
01:00:39.064 --> 01:00:41.164
You know many social enterprises.

1011
01:00:41.533 --> 01:00:43.874
Won Joo would know a few as well.

1012
01:00:44.934 --> 01:00:47.604
Were you up all night printing these?

1013
01:00:48.604 --> 01:00:50.113
He said he wouldn't survive...

1014
01:00:50.473 --> 01:00:52.144
if he were dragged back now

1015
01:00:52.613 --> 01:00:56.084
Don't ever tell him that I looked this up.

1016
01:00:56.084 --> 01:00:58.184
That won't be good for him.

1017
01:00:58.954 --> 01:00:59.984
Okay.

1018
01:01:28.684 --> 01:01:30.553
Do Kyung, let's talk.

1019
01:01:33.124 --> 01:01:34.584
So early in the morning?

1020
01:01:34.584 --> 01:01:36.153
I've decided to help you.

1021
01:01:36.823 --> 01:01:39.363
Your business is about up-cycling.

1022
01:01:39.964 --> 01:01:41.693
That's what I invest in.

1023
01:01:42.434 --> 01:01:43.434
You invest?

1024
01:01:43.734 --> 01:01:45.664
I'm not offering money.

1025
01:01:45.964 --> 01:01:48.934
I'll use my connections to help find a factory...

1026
01:01:49.274 --> 01:01:50.734
and buy machines...

1027
01:01:51.533 --> 01:01:53.774
by passing on things like this.

1028
01:01:55.274 --> 01:01:56.374
"Passing on"?

1029
01:01:56.374 --> 01:01:57.943
Second-hand machines.

1030
01:01:58.374 --> 01:02:01.214
The machinery you need to make pellets.

1031
01:02:01.214 --> 01:02:02.513
It's all there.

1032
01:02:03.153 --> 01:02:05.454
I got it from Ji An before work.

1033
01:02:05.854 --> 01:02:07.653
I bet she was up all night.

1034
01:02:14.493 --> 01:02:16.493
Ji An gave you this?

1035
01:02:17.133 --> 01:02:18.193
Yes.

1036
01:02:18.693 --> 01:02:21.104
She asked me to pretend I did the work,

1037
01:02:21.964 --> 01:02:25.033
but I'm useless at keeping secrets like this.

1038
01:02:27.903 --> 01:02:28.943
This is...

1039
01:02:29.914 --> 01:02:33.144
I asked Won Joo to find a few possible factories.

1040
01:02:33.484 --> 01:02:35.283
He's into up-cycling...

1041
01:02:35.343 --> 01:02:37.283
and they have regular meetings.

1042
01:02:37.754 --> 01:02:40.754
You should go through that first.

1043
01:02:42.254 --> 01:02:43.323
Thanks.

1044
01:02:43.493 --> 01:02:45.223
But where were you...

1045
01:02:45.223 --> 01:02:46.464
all dressed up like that?

1046
01:02:46.964 --> 01:02:47.993
Haesung corporation.

1047
01:02:48.693 --> 01:02:50.434
To strengthen myself.

1048
01:02:51.834 --> 01:02:54.964
However hard my grandpa tries to stop me,

1049
01:02:55.164 --> 01:02:57.073
even if I must work part-time for 100 years,

1050
01:02:57.403 --> 01:02:58.973
I told myself...

1051
01:02:58.973 --> 01:03:02.414
I'd never use the money he had given to me.

1052
01:03:04.673 --> 01:03:06.044
Then I got this gift.

1053
01:03:10.314 --> 01:03:11.383
Hello.

1054
01:03:13.153 --> 01:03:15.484
Sir, Sun Tae, and Ji An.

1055
01:03:15.693 --> 01:03:18.624
I'm Choi Do Kyung and I'll take your waste for free.

1056
01:03:18.723 --> 01:03:21.894
If you pack them up, I'll make good use of them.

1057
01:03:22.223 --> 01:03:24.633
The more you throw out, the better.

1058
01:03:24.633 --> 01:03:27.164
You want us to throw away perfectly fine wood?

1059
01:03:27.604 --> 01:03:29.874
Only if you aren't sure if they'll be of any use.

1060
01:03:29.934 --> 01:03:32.343
I'm busy today, so I'll go now.

1061
01:03:38.073 --> 01:03:40.783
Did he sort something out already?

1062
01:03:48.584 --> 01:03:51.823
Sir, can I drop by the office for 10 minutes?

1063
01:04:05.234 --> 01:04:06.303
Where are you going?

1064
01:04:08.004 --> 01:04:09.173
I was...

1065
01:04:09.943 --> 01:04:11.414
going to the office.

1066
01:04:11.774 --> 01:04:14.984
I wanted to ask Yong Gook something about work.

1067
01:04:17.814 --> 01:04:19.524
I can answer that.

1068
01:04:26.823 --> 01:04:28.064
Were you up all night?

1069
01:04:34.734 --> 01:04:36.834
You couldn't give it to me yourself.

1070
01:04:38.073 --> 01:04:39.803
You couldn't show any concern either.

1071
01:04:41.774 --> 01:04:43.343
Why must it be like this?

1072
01:04:43.644 --> 01:04:44.673
It's friendship.

1073
01:04:47.243 --> 01:04:48.243
"Friendship"?

1074
01:04:48.414 --> 01:04:49.954
What's wrong is wrong,

1075
01:04:50.414 --> 01:04:52.153
and I understand so well...

1076
01:04:52.254 --> 01:04:54.254
why you can't go home yet.

1077
01:04:54.624 --> 01:04:57.354
You don't want to be your grandpa's loose part.

1078
01:04:57.354 --> 01:04:58.794
Will you marry me?

1079
01:04:59.323 --> 01:05:00.664
I won't marry you.

1080
01:05:01.464 --> 01:05:03.193
You won't marry me, will you?

1081
01:05:07.604 --> 01:05:10.073
Let's date, Ji An.

1082
01:05:12.874 --> 01:05:14.903
I don't want to marry you.

1083
01:05:15.544 --> 01:05:16.644
But...

1084
01:05:17.774 --> 01:05:19.144
I want to at least date you.

1085
01:05:20.843 --> 01:05:21.984
So...

1086
01:05:23.013 --> 01:05:25.823
let's just date, Ji An.

1087
01:05:31.053 --> 01:05:32.124
Let's do it.

1088
01:05:34.093 --> 01:05:35.193
Dating only.

1089
01:05:37.934 --> 01:05:39.064
At least that.

1090
01:05:47.204 --> 01:05:48.274
Okay.

1091
01:05:53.314 --> 01:05:54.443
Dating only.

1092
01:05:56.254 --> 01:05:57.254
Fine.

1093
01:05:59.783 --> 01:06:00.984
Dating only.

1094
01:06:50.973 --> 01:06:53.604
(My Golden Life)

1095
01:06:55.104 --> 01:06:57.113
- Ji An. - Hi.

1096
01:06:57.144 --> 01:06:59.914
Let's go. We'll do everything others do.

1097
01:07:00.044 --> 01:07:02.513
Couples always stand like this.

1098
01:07:02.653 --> 01:07:04.254
Where are So Ra's lamps?

1099
01:07:04.254 --> 01:07:05.823
What did you eat with So Ra?

1100
01:07:05.823 --> 01:07:07.823
- Where did you go? - What?

1101
01:07:07.823 --> 01:07:10.624
How long will Chief Director Choi be on leave?

1102
01:07:10.624 --> 01:07:12.124
Whoever that woman is,

1103
01:07:12.124 --> 01:07:13.863
what if Do Kyung chooses her...

1104
01:07:13.863 --> 01:07:15.464
over the company?

1105
01:07:15.464 --> 01:07:16.493
Mom.

1106
01:07:16.493 --> 01:07:18.633
Ji An. We meet again.

1107
01:07:18.633 --> 01:07:20.133
Have you lost your mind?

1108
01:07:20.734 --> 01:07:22.903
Do Kyung, let's meet.

1109
01:07:23.434 --> 01:07:24.633
Do Kyung.
