<i>Prisoner 4713 is here for his treatment.</i>

5
00:00:25.303 --> 00:00:26.903
<i>Why didn't I realize it earlier?</i>

6
00:00:27.403 --> 00:00:28.903
You haven't changed one bit!

7
00:00:30.125 --> 00:00:33.635
Your father came to me and said
that he needed money for his kids.

8
00:00:33.635 --> 00:00:36.436
He said that he didn't even
have money for his daughter's surgery

9
00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:38.635
but that his son had asked for sneakers.

10
00:00:39.317 --> 00:00:41.052
Doctor!

11
00:00:41.052 --> 00:00:43.401
Kim Hyung Bum told me
about my father's last words.

12
00:00:43.401 --> 00:00:46.640
That's why I told you to leave there.
Staying by him will only be hard for you.

13
00:00:46.643 --> 00:00:49.479
4817, let's make a deal.

14
00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:51.229
- Baek Sung Ho.
- Yes?

15
00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:53.804
- You've been snacking, haven't you?
- I don't have any money.

16
00:00:53.804 --> 00:00:55.402
Then why are your levels so high?

17
00:00:58.399 --> 00:00:59.798
My stomach hurts so much.

18
00:01:01.818 --> 00:01:03.818
Have... have another.

19
00:01:09.599 --> 00:01:11.083
Call an internal medicine doctor!

20
00:01:11.083 --> 00:01:13.432
- Call N.S. as well.
- Why do we need neurosurgery?

21
00:01:13.432 --> 00:01:15.662
He could've damaged
his brain during the fall.

22
00:01:15.662 --> 00:01:18.827
I'm his guardian. I know him best!

23
00:01:18.828 --> 00:01:21.028
Are you sure he's getting
the right treatment?

24
00:01:22.425 --> 00:01:24.974
Neurosurgery.
Hurry and call neurosurgery!

25
00:01:24.974 --> 00:01:26.575
And take a brain CT! Hurry!

26
00:01:26.575 --> 00:01:27.775
4713.

27
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.370
What do we do? The doctors
are out at the moment

28
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.370
and so is the ambulance car.

29
00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:37.899
- Did you call 911?
- Yes.

30
00:01:42.048 --> 00:01:43.850
<i>[Episode 7]</i>

31
00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:56.481
Move! This is an emergency!

32
00:02:10.223 --> 00:02:12.073
<i>[February 13th, 2018, 7 p.m.
Palmunsan Funeral Hall, Son: Kang In Kyu]</i>

33
00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:22.999
I'm afraid that we discovered it too late

34
00:03:23.444 --> 00:03:25.944
so there's nothing we can do.

35
00:03:26.444 --> 00:03:28.644
I advise that you
prepare yourself emotionally.

36
00:04:11.946 --> 00:04:15.347
Is surgery not at all possible?

37
00:04:17.816 --> 00:04:19.816
That man was his guardian, wasn't he?

38
00:04:20.316 --> 00:04:23.550
- Yes.
- I explained it indirectly for him.

39
00:04:23.552 --> 00:04:25.352
He already has brain herniation.

40
00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:30.900
His brain is swollen
and already expanding past his skull.

41
00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.999
Didn't you say that the patient
has a history of diabetes?

42
00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:38.799
The brain swells even faster
in patients with blood sugar problems.

43
00:04:39.329 --> 00:04:42.829
If we open up his skull now,
we won't be able to close it back up.

44
00:05:04.026 --> 00:05:06.812
- Hello?
<i>- Doctor Kang, we're in trouble.</i>

45
00:05:06.812 --> 00:05:09.122
Prisoner Kim Hyung Bum
was in critical condition, so...

46
00:05:09.122 --> 00:05:12.379
- What happened to Kim Hyung Bum?
- He came here in a state of shock

47
00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:15.679
so we sent him away in an ambulance,
but they got into a car accident.

48
00:05:16.179 --> 00:05:19.480
Hold on. Did you say
that he went into shock?

49
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.725
- Yes.
<i>- What state was he in exactly?</i>

50
00:05:22.725 --> 00:05:25.555
He was convulsing
and exhibited hemoptysis.

51
00:05:25.555 --> 00:05:27.365
<i>Convulsion and hemoptysis.</i>

52
00:05:27.365 --> 00:05:30.335
<i>Acute renal failure has finally begun.</i>

53
00:05:30.335 --> 00:05:33.335
- You said there was a car accident?
<i>- Yes.</i>

54
00:05:33.335 --> 00:05:36.203
- Which hospital was he taken to?
- Goil Hospital.

55
00:05:36.203 --> 00:05:39.093
I got a call saying that Prison Officer
Lee Joo Young is over there.

56
00:05:39.093 --> 00:05:40.194
I got it.

57
00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:54.847
What on earth is going on? What do
you mean, there was a car accident?

58
00:05:54.847 --> 00:05:56.662
Why did Prisoner 4713 leave the prison

59
00:05:56.662 --> 00:05:58.484
and why did the ambulance
get into car accident?

60
00:05:58.484 --> 00:06:01.734
The patient was in critical condition,
but there was nothing we could do

61
00:06:01.734 --> 00:06:03.033
so we sent him to a hospital.

62
00:06:03.533 --> 00:06:07.533
Why was there nothing you could do,
when there are two doctors here?

63
00:06:08.095 --> 00:06:09.295
Wait.

64
00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:16.809
- Where did everyone go?
- Sunrim Hospital.

65
00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:18.259
Why did they go there?

66
00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:21.259
Because Prisoner Baek Sung Ho
was in critical situation...

67
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.900
Sir.

68
00:06:26.425 --> 00:06:31.052
How on earth did you manage the place
to let all this happen in one day?

69
00:06:31.052 --> 00:06:33.552
And not just one,
but two emergencies in one day!

70
00:06:34.098 --> 00:06:35.499
I apologize.

71
00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:42.711
Keep your mouths shut
until we get more information.

72
00:06:42.711 --> 00:06:44.612
So that this doesn't leak out!

73
00:06:45.138 --> 00:06:46.538
Yes, Sir.

74
00:06:47.782 --> 00:06:49.282
Move!

75
00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:01.234
Oh, sure. One moment, please.

76
00:07:01.234 --> 00:07:03.533
Doctor! Doctor Kang!

77
00:07:05.598 --> 00:07:08.799
- Move! Move!
- Coming through!

78
00:07:19.485 --> 00:07:23.537
Excuse me, where's the patient
from Shingwang Prison?

79
00:07:23.537 --> 00:07:25.883
Oh, the patient from Shingwang Prison?

80
00:07:25.883 --> 00:07:27.783
I think he's over there.

81
00:07:41.199 --> 00:07:43.900
- Are you all right?
- Yes, Doctor.

82
00:07:45.139 --> 00:07:47.639
Where's Prisoner Kim Hyung Bum?

83
00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:50.838
- 4713?
- Yes.

84
00:07:52.932 --> 00:07:54.734
Isn't he here?

85
00:07:55.799 --> 00:07:58.199
Weren't you transferred here together?

86
00:07:58.199 --> 00:08:01.331
No, 4713 was transferred first.

87
00:08:01.331 --> 00:08:02.932
To which hospital?

88
00:08:17.135 --> 00:08:19.233
I don't know
which hospital he was taken to...

89
00:08:22.775 --> 00:08:25.150
Is he really not here?

90
00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:26.800
No.

91
00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.699
Was he taken
to a different hospital then?

92
00:08:33.724 --> 00:08:38.550
Did Kim Hyung Bum regain consciousness
while he was being transferred?

93
00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:42.351
No, he was in a
state of shock the whole time.

94
00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:46.969
Okay, I understand. Please stay put.

95
00:08:46.969 --> 00:08:48.069
Okay.

96
00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:59.349
Yes, hello. I'm looking for a patient
who was transferred by ambulance.

97
00:08:59.849 --> 00:09:03.150
Yes, his name is Kim Hyung Bum,
and he's a prisoner at Shingwang Prison.

98
00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:06.469
<i>I'm sorry, but there's
no one by that name.</i>

<i>[Ian Hospital]</i>

101
00:09:33.299 --> 00:09:37.799
It's currently 9:40 p.m. We'll begin
the first brain death examination.

102
00:09:39.824 --> 00:09:42.525
I'll check his cerebral reflex first.

103
00:09:48.325 --> 00:09:50.925
Can you hear me?

104
00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:01.449
I'll check his brain stem reflex.

105
00:10:10.772 --> 00:10:14.793
Both his right and left eyes
are open by 10 millimeters.

106
00:10:14.793 --> 00:10:16.693
And I see no signs of pupillary reflex.

107
00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.439
This will hurt a bit.

108
00:10:31.349 --> 00:10:32.806
What's this?

109
00:10:32.806 --> 00:10:36.160
I made it for you
during job preparation class.

110
00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.460
So we can have a celebratory drink
when I'm released next month.

111
00:10:40.998 --> 00:10:43.698
Are you still thinking about drinking?

112
00:10:47.306 --> 00:10:51.171
Are you allowed to bring
such things without permission?

113
00:10:51.171 --> 00:10:52.371
I'm not.

114
00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:56.650
Just leave it.

115
00:11:27.421 --> 00:11:30.021
Lastly, we'll conduct a respiratory test.

116
00:11:40.583 --> 00:11:43.453
We'll come back in five minutes
to check his results.

117
00:11:43.453 --> 00:11:47.453
We'll be back in six hours
to conduct the second round of tests.

118
00:12:18.514 --> 00:12:20.014
Here!

119
00:12:21.357 --> 00:12:23.549
Whoa, good job!

120
00:12:23.549 --> 00:12:26.222
- That's right!
- Keep up the good work!

121
00:12:41.092 --> 00:12:44.116
Hey, Sung Ho.

122
00:12:54.199 --> 00:12:55.500
Sung Ho.

123
00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:04.945
Excuse me, did a patient
in a prison uniform come in?

124
00:13:04.945 --> 00:13:07.846
- No.
- What about one from a car accident?

125
00:13:07.846 --> 00:13:10.818
There's one car accident patient
on the far side of the room.

126
00:13:10.818 --> 00:13:12.818
Why don't you go in and check?

- Excuse me.
- Oh, hello.

128
00:13:48.234 --> 00:13:52.246
Did you transfer a car accident patient
from National Highway 27 today?

129
00:13:52.246 --> 00:13:55.193
No, we didn't.

130
00:13:55.193 --> 00:13:58.133
I'm sorry, but could you
look it up on your database?

131
00:13:58.133 --> 00:14:01.933
- What's the patient's name?

We don't know the details either.

All we know is that a prisoner collapsed

- so we sent him in an ambulance car.
- Hang up.

Okay, have a good evening.

143
00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:02.779
- This is Shingwang Prison.
- Any news on Prisoner Kim Hyung Bum?

144
00:15:02.779 --> 00:15:05.339
- Hang up. Hang up.
- It's Doctor Kang.

Doctor, where are you?
Hurry over here. It's hectic right now.

I asked if you heard
anything about Kim Hyung Bum!

No, not yet.

we explain the organ donation
process to the family members.

I'll leave you to make the decision

while I briefly explain the program.

155
00:15:57.434 --> 00:16:00.842
The decision to make
an organ donation completely depends

on your and his other
family members' opinions..

157

If you don't express your opinion,

Why didn't I suspect that?

do you mean Doctor Kang In Kyu?

248
00:25:52.773 --> 00:25:57.673

We've already received one from the organ

It'd be nice if we had just one more.

- From an influential man.
- I'll look into it further.

you're managing Congressman Noh's
documents properly, right?

Of course.

If the center chief were
to catch on at a crucial time like this

it would get very complicated.
