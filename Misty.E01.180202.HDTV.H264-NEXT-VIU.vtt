00:01:24.401 --> 00:01:25.401
You're here.

2
00:01:28.104 --> 00:01:31.141
It's a car accident. I requested for a corresponding process.

3
00:01:31.541 --> 00:01:33.770
And we're trying to identify the victim too.

4
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.041
It's a downhill road on a snowy day, so it might've caused the accident.

5
00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.731
- Does that belong to the victim? - Pardon?

6
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.020
This way, ma'am.

7
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.370
First of all, she's really pretty and has a great body.

8
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.070
She's not someone you want to mess with.

9
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.790
- Are you going on a date? - No, Sir.

10
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.300
She my ideal type.

11
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.890
Get to work, would you?

12
00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.160
Seems like it's too much for you to handle on your own, right?

13
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.280
Basically, she talks to people for a living.

14
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.010
What do you think? Should I help you out?

15
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.440
Would you like to?

16
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.570
Of course.

17
00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.380
With everything that's happening, I should help out.

18
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.360
There's an attempted rape in the next room.

19
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.040
Why don't you take that on for me?

20
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.900
That needs to be wrapped up by today.

21
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.890
With everything that's happening, thanks for your help.

22
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.190
Well, then...

23
00:04:26.145 --> 00:04:27.615
Are you...

24
00:04:29.854 --> 00:04:30.854
Go Hye Ran?

25
00:04:45.105 --> 00:04:48.235
Yes, that's me.

26
00:04:50.446 --> 00:04:52.775
Thank you for your cooperation to begin with.

- I'm sure you're very busy. - Let's end it within 30 minutes.

28
00:04:58.446 --> 00:05:00.616
That way, I can be there on time for my news show.

29
00:05:00.855 --> 00:05:04.626
- Goodness. - She's really something.

30
00:05:04.686 --> 00:05:06.626
She's more than a celebrity.

31
00:05:06.626 --> 00:05:08.326
- I told you. - I know.

32
00:05:14.066 --> 00:05:15.996
Do you live precisely all the time?

33
00:05:16.905 --> 00:05:18.266
I try to.

34
00:05:18.735 --> 00:05:21.775
- Then you must have a good memory. - I hope so.

35
00:05:29.376 --> 00:05:30.485
A person died.

36
00:05:32.085 --> 00:05:33.085
So what?

37
00:05:38.655 --> 00:05:39.686
Do you know...

38
00:05:41.256 --> 00:05:42.425
who this man is?

39
00:05:58.345 --> 00:05:59.345
Do you know him?

40
00:06:19.996 --> 00:06:20.996
I love you.

41
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.020
I love you.

43

Hye Ran?

44
00:07:08.735 --> 00:07:09.735
Hye Ran.

45
00:07:24.755 --> 00:07:25.826
I must be crazy.

46
00:07:26.055 --> 00:07:27.125
Did you have a dream?

47
00:07:28.526 --> 00:07:30.166
I dozed off for a second.

48
00:07:30.466 --> 00:07:32.526
You should feel nervous at least for a bit.

49
00:07:32.925 --> 00:07:37.065
I know you win the award every year, but you should keep your manners.

50
00:07:37.505 --> 00:07:38.505
I know.

51
00:07:39.406 --> 00:07:42.336
- You look pretty. It's done. - Thanks.

Congratulations in advance.

Come on. I'm here to present the award today.

59
00:08:38.426 --> 00:08:42.035
And how many times did you go up to do so and receive the award?

60
00:08:42.495 --> 00:08:44.005
You're here early. Have a seat.

61
00:08:45.706 --> 00:08:48.635

"Go Hye Ran Receives Another Broadcaster of the Year".

63

It's just way too obvious.

64
00:08:58.946 --> 00:09:03.316
There are so many talented juniors these days. No one knows the result.

65
00:09:03.385 --> 00:09:06.926
Oh, right. Han Ji Won has been hot lately.

66
00:09:10.696 --> 00:09:12.326
Ji Won worked hard too.

67

What? You will...

68
00:09:18.706 --> 00:09:20.035
win the award today?

69
00:09:22.436 --> 00:09:26.005
Yes, so please make me look bright, okay?

70
00:09:26.706 --> 00:09:27.716
Okay.

- who showed... - Who do you think is the winner?

74
00:09:47.596 --> 00:09:49.596
an exemplary attitude of upright and just broadcasters in the generation.

75
00:09:49.596 --> 00:09:52.535
Earlier, I saw the result out of curiosity.

76
00:09:53.336 --> 00:09:55.706
But don't be surprised too much later.

77
00:09:55.706 --> 00:09:59.046
I'll now announce those who will present the award.

Yes. She has won the Broadcaster of the Year for five years in a row.

I'm sorry about my prank earlier, okay?

Maybe she's coming up to congratulate her.

98
00:11:58.596 --> 00:12:03.535
She's on the stage with flowers to congratulate the winner.

how a junior congratulates her senior.

101

Reporter Han Ji Won is always beautiful indeed.

102

118
00:13:35.426 --> 00:13:37.066
Are you upset about something?

119
00:13:38.326 --> 00:13:41.466
No, it's a happy day for me.

120
00:13:45.035 --> 00:13:46.936
If it's that good, turn it over to me.

121
00:13:49.436 --> 00:13:51.346
You're too competent...

122
00:13:51.346 --> 00:13:53.615
that a junior like me can't have a chance.

123
00:13:53.615 --> 00:13:55.946
You'll have a chance when the time comes.

124
00:13:56.115 --> 00:13:59.385
Then again, you're standing firm at that age of yours.

125
00:13:59.415 --> 00:14:01.515
Female anchors' positions have gotten strengthened thanks to you.

126
00:14:02.216 --> 00:14:03.755
I should thank you for that.

127
00:14:11.765 --> 00:14:14.135
A competent junior gave me such a compliment.

128
00:14:14.135 --> 00:14:16.066
I feel like I should do better.

129
00:14:16.836 --> 00:14:18.206
I should do harder...

130
00:14:18.905 --> 00:14:20.375
and longer.

131
00:14:24.176 --> 00:14:26.046
I wanted to have a good talk with you after a while,

132
00:14:26.946 --> 00:14:27.976
but I have to go. Sorry.

133
00:14:40.625 --> 00:14:41.625
Hello?

134
00:14:41.625 --> 00:14:43.155
You should come right now.

135
00:14:43.155 --> 00:14:44.525
- Why? - Call her guardian right now.

136
00:14:44.525 --> 00:14:45.865
- Is something going on? - Hey!

137
00:14:45.966 --> 00:14:48.936
Come here right this instant. I won't let you get away with it.

138
00:14:49.235 --> 00:14:51.005
Come here right now, you wench.

139
00:14:51.365 --> 00:14:53.806
I'll kill you today.

140
00:14:53.806 --> 00:14:55.405
You wench.

141
00:15:04.745 --> 00:15:07.655
Hey, I have business to take care of before I go to the office.

142
00:15:07.915 --> 00:15:09.885
Send me the script via e-mail when it's out.

143
00:15:10.385 --> 00:15:11.826
I'll arrive before the rehearsal.

144
00:15:12.625 --> 00:15:14.856
Please cover for me so that the senior manager doesn't get upset.

145
00:15:36.915 --> 00:15:39.546
Kaham is an illegal immigrant from Bangladesh.

146
00:15:39.615 --> 00:15:42.586
He committed violence against his employer, Choi Byung Man,

147
00:15:42.586 --> 00:15:46.025
and caused him injury that will take six weeks to fully recover.

148
00:15:46.125 --> 00:15:48.456
The prosecution demands him...

149
00:15:48.755 --> 00:15:52.525
imprisonment for a year and deportation after the sentence.

150
00:15:54.895 --> 00:15:56.165
Quiet down.

151
00:15:57.405 --> 00:15:58.966
(Judge)

152
00:16:01.306 --> 00:16:03.606
Attorney, you may make your statement.

153
00:16:06.206 --> 00:16:09.415
Before then, I'd like to confirm something with the plaintiff.

154
00:16:11.915 --> 00:16:14.456
Why did Choi Byung Man get beaten?

155
00:16:16.356 --> 00:16:18.255
You seem to be unaware of the full story of the case.

156
00:16:18.255 --> 00:16:19.326
Let me explain.

157
00:16:20.226 --> 00:16:22.125
Choi Byung Man is the CEO of Hwanil Steel.

158
00:16:22.556 --> 00:16:25.365
And he didn't give Kaham his payment for two years.

159
00:16:26.096 --> 00:16:29.566
He committed violence out of desperate request...

160
00:16:29.566 --> 00:16:31.535
for his payment.

161
00:16:32.005 --> 00:16:33.106
Kaham's salary...

162
00:16:34.235 --> 00:16:36.905
means food and water for his family in his home country.

163
00:16:37.346 --> 00:16:39.176
Nothing can justify violence.

164
00:16:39.176 --> 00:16:40.316
That's right.

165
00:16:43.015 --> 00:16:45.446
He should get punished. However,

166
00:16:46.145 --> 00:16:49.216
the victim deserves punishment too...

167
00:16:49.456 --> 00:16:51.186
because the law must be fair to everyone.

168
00:16:52.926 --> 00:16:55.926
Don't you agree, Prosecutor Byun Woo Hyun?

169
00:17:00.895 --> 00:17:04.536
So you will sue Choi Byung Man for violating the labor law, right?

170
00:17:04.536 --> 00:17:06.905
Well, you want to place the blame.

171
00:17:07.975 --> 00:17:09.375
Settling the case will be much simpler.

172
00:17:09.375 --> 00:17:11.306
It would've been much simpler if he had paid Kaham in the first place.

Okay, I'll check the facts once the complaint is submitted.

You still look at your wife with such warm eyes.

The assailant and the victim of most hate crimes like this...

278
00:26:18.734 --> 00:26:22.603
have no grudges between them.

279
00:26:22.934 --> 00:26:26.743
Also, women and old people are often targeted.

280

Good. That was nice and clean.

a detailed plan to protect those future victims...

288
00:26:54.234 --> 00:26:55.833
is more important than just paying attention.

289

Reporter Han, did you investigate about any safety nets for this?

290

Well, along with strengthening the safety in alleyways,

As far as I know, it's already taking effect.

293
00:27:13.724 --> 00:27:18.293
Isn't its effectiveness an issue to reconsider?

294
00:27:19.763 --> 00:27:22.263
Recently, the government has been installing more streetlights...

295
00:27:22.263 --> 00:27:26.833
and designating places like convenience stores...

296
00:27:26.833 --> 00:27:28.704
as temporary shelters.

297
00:27:28.803 --> 00:27:32.043
Those seem to be measures taken after the fair too.

298
00:27:32.644 --> 00:27:36.644
It's critical to come up with a fundamental countermeasure.

299

00:29:29.993 --> 00:29:31.124
"A human documentary"?

329
00:29:31.293 --> 00:29:33.493
Put your name on the line and make it cool.

330
00:29:38.603 --> 00:29:40.003
What about "News Nine"?

331
00:29:40.003 --> 00:29:44.073
You're not the only anchor we have. There are many with talent.

332
00:29:44.073 --> 00:29:47.874
Do you already have someone in mind?

333
00:29:47.874 --> 00:29:51.013
Our rival channel is doing well after making use of young people.

334
00:29:51.013 --> 00:29:52.813
We might let them have us at this rate.

335
00:29:53.013 --> 00:29:55.614
What if even our regular viewers decide to watch other channels?

336
00:29:55.614 --> 00:29:57.984
We can't rely on our regulars forever.

337
00:29:58.783 --> 00:30:00.293
We need to have new customers too.

338
00:30:00.293 --> 00:30:02.823
"Go Hye Ran's News Nine" has been aired for 7 years...

339
00:30:03.194 --> 00:30:05.364
with the highest viewership for the time and the highest reliability.

340
00:30:05.464 --> 00:30:07.833
You know I achieved all that.

341
00:30:08.234 --> 00:30:11.803
Is that all thanks to you?

342
00:30:12.704 --> 00:30:14.003
You're too proud.

343
00:30:14.833 --> 00:30:18.803
Is this how you thank me for not giving your award to Han Ji Won?

344
00:30:18.803 --> 00:30:20.444
- Sir. - Forget it.

345
00:30:21.374 --> 00:30:25.783
Come up with detailed plans for the project by tomorrow's meeting.

346
00:30:27.214 --> 00:30:28.214
The end.

347
00:30:31.323 --> 00:30:33.323
The game is over.

348
00:30:34.323 --> 00:30:39.364
Honestly, violence is closer than law, but money is the closest.

349
00:30:41.493 --> 00:30:45.033
We always get turned down. I have nothing more to save my face.

350
00:30:45.864 --> 00:30:46.934
I know.

351
00:30:46.934 --> 00:30:49.634
You can't succeed like this.

352
00:30:50.003 --> 00:30:52.144
You'll be like this for your entire life.

353
00:30:54.513 --> 00:30:56.743
Well, what will you do if you succeed?

354
00:30:56.743 --> 00:31:00.053
I live only once, so I want to lead a decent, cool life.

355
00:31:00.484 --> 00:31:03.353
Can't you see you're leading a decent, cool life now?

356
00:31:04.624 --> 00:31:08.424
Right, that's why we haven't paid our rent for four months.

357
00:31:08.424 --> 00:31:10.924
And we're only having ramyeon for our late-night snacks.

358
00:31:12.364 --> 00:31:14.434
You had omurice for dinner.

359
00:31:18.063 --> 00:31:22.174
By any chance, does your wife not nag you?

360
00:31:22.533 --> 00:31:24.704
You became a public defender...

361
00:31:24.803 --> 00:31:26.843
from a successful prosecutor.

362
00:31:26.974 --> 00:31:28.944
And you work overtime or stay up all night so often.

363
00:31:29.273 --> 00:31:32.243
Doesn't she complain about that at all?

364
00:31:32.644 --> 00:31:34.783
Well... Not really.

365
00:31:41.224 --> 00:31:42.224
Gosh, it's hot.

366
00:31:51.634 --> 00:31:53.474
If it's that good, why don't you give it to me?

367
00:31:53.474 --> 00:31:54.634
You've done a good job.

368
00:31:55.174 --> 00:31:58.204
Chief Jang was trying to help her finish her career well.

369
00:31:58.204 --> 00:32:01.374
Our rival channel is doing well after making use of young people.

370
00:32:18.593 --> 00:32:19.624
I love you.

371
00:32:32.848 --> 00:32:36.848
I love you, Hye Ran.

372
00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:41.290
Ma'am...

373
00:32:42.398 --> 00:32:43.468
Ma'am?

374
00:32:59.454 --> 00:33:00.925
What's wrong with me?

375
00:33:02.284 --> 00:33:03.625
Am I sexually frustrated?

376
00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:13.911
Go Hye Ran, right?

377
00:33:15.790 --> 00:33:17.019
I enjoy watching you on the news.

378
00:33:17.219 --> 00:33:18.097
Ah, yes.

379
00:33:38.121 --> 00:33:43.121

380
00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:07.500
I love you.

381
00:34:08.371 --> 00:34:09.871
This is driving me crazy.

382
00:34:20.521 --> 00:34:21.550
Mother.

383
00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:23.751
Have you forgotten about our meeting?

384
00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:27.021
- Pardon? - Why didn't you come on time?

385
00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:31.431
Oh... Right... That's...

386
00:34:32.931 --> 00:34:34.260
I left medicine in the kitchen.

387
00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:37.400
Okay.

388
00:34:42.670 --> 00:34:46.211
I told you to keep your body warm to get pregnant.

389
00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:53.481
Do you make sure to be on schedule?

390
00:34:56.150 --> 00:34:57.190
Yes.

391
00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:00.561
Apparently, Tae Wook has nothing wrong.

392
00:35:01.021 --> 00:35:02.961
I wonder what is wrong.

393
00:35:08.501 --> 00:35:09.601
You don't need to walk me out.

394
00:35:43.431 --> 00:35:44.771
Mother was here.

395
00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:51.911
It's as if she's here to collect her daily interest.

396
00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:55.981
This day always comes back so soon, right?

397
00:35:58.110 --> 00:35:59.150
Later.

398
00:35:59.481 --> 00:36:00.820
Anyway, I gave it to you.

399
00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:05.050
I've tried.

400
00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:15.461
The script in the cell phone...

401
00:37:15.621 --> 00:37:17.130
Do you have a suspect list?

402
00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:18.130
Is he on the list?

403
00:37:20.731 --> 00:37:22.461
He said you want the money.

404
00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:25.001
Excuse me, guys. Kevin Lee will not be conducting...

405
00:37:25.001 --> 00:37:26.641
interviews with any media.

406
00:37:27.141 --> 00:37:29.371
The only place you can see him is on the golf course.

407
00:37:47.391 --> 00:37:50.090
People were worried about their electric bills...

408
00:37:50.090 --> 00:37:52.391
last summer due to scorching weather.

409
00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:54.530
There is good news for people...

410
00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:57.331
who are worried about electric bills in this freezing weather.

411
00:37:57.701 --> 00:38:00.141
Voices are rising that the government's...

412
00:38:00.141 --> 00:38:02.240
House Electric Act, which is applied to all social groups,

413
00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:06.610
should reduce the burden of the poor's electric bills.

414
00:38:06.681 --> 00:38:08.411
Reporter Park Hyun Min will cover it.

415
00:38:09.311 --> 00:38:11.550
Freezing weather continues.

416
00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:14.150
We should take a look around...

417
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:18.050
and see if anyone is isolated in this cold weather.

418
00:38:18.521 --> 00:38:21.621
Beware of damages by the cold weather and snow today.

419
00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:24.130
"Morning News on Monday" will finish here.

420
00:38:24.130 --> 00:38:26.291
Have a good day, viewers.

421
00:38:26.291 --> 00:38:28.501
I'm your anchor, Han Ji Won.

422
00:38:32.601 --> 00:38:33.601
Good job.

423
00:38:35.141 --> 00:38:36.811
You look great.

424
00:38:37.141 --> 00:38:41.481
Your youth rushes out of the screen.

425
00:38:43.311 --> 00:38:46.251
Isn't she different from Go Hye Ran?

426
00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:48.320
You're just so happy.

427
00:38:50.791 --> 00:38:52.220
Call the reorganization committee.

428
00:38:52.521 --> 00:38:53.521
Yes, sir.

429
00:38:55.561 --> 00:38:57.990
- Good job. - Good job.

430
00:39:00.701 --> 00:39:02.530
Who on earth is Kevin Lee?

431
00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:06.470
He must be so great. All media companies are digging him,

432
00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:08.340
but they aren't getting anything.

433
00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:11.170
One of my seniors went to the US too,

434
00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:12.970
but he couldn't even see his shadow.

435
00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:18.280
Even the president is going crazy about Kevin Lee...

436
00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:21.081
that he gave a special order to get a hold of every show...

437
00:39:21.081 --> 00:39:23.391
- with Kevin Lee. - Even the president?

438
00:39:23.391 --> 00:39:24.451
Yes.

439
00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:27.760
Whoever catches Kevin Lee will get a big, exclusive, and unique story.

440
00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:29.920
It's like catching three birds with one stone.

441
00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:33.300
If you're lucky, you'll be promoted to an executive director too.

442
00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:36.800
There are plus points in that. It's tempting.

443
00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:39.400
- Good morning. - You're here.

444
00:39:42.101 --> 00:39:44.041
You look great this morning.

445
00:39:45.771 --> 00:39:49.081
Are you all getting ready for reorganization next week?

446
00:39:49.110 --> 00:39:50.110
- Yes. - Yes.

447
00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:53.681
Everyone is after Kevin Lee. I'm getting exhausted.

448
00:39:53.681 --> 00:39:54.851
So am I.

449
00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:59.550
Also, do you remember the human documentary program...

450
00:39:59.650 --> 00:40:01.990
I told you last week aside from liberal arts station?

451
00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:03.791
Go Hye Ran...

452
00:40:04.931 --> 00:40:06.130
will be the host.

453
00:40:16.201 --> 00:40:17.541
Then what about "News Nine"?

454
00:40:20.041 --> 00:40:21.041
Han Ji Won.

455
00:40:23.351 --> 00:40:24.550
Do you feel confident?

456
00:40:25.681 --> 00:40:26.720
Me?

457
00:40:27.521 --> 00:40:30.791
Well, I should do my best if you give me the chance.

458
00:40:30.851 --> 00:40:32.820
- I'll do my best. - Okay.

459
00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:35.090
Gosh, this is shocking.

460
00:40:35.090 --> 00:40:37.190
Han Ji Won is a great move, sir.

461
00:40:38.130 --> 00:40:41.501
Will "News Nine" revive with her youth?

462
00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:44.871
Congratulations, Reporter Han.

463
00:40:47.641 --> 00:40:50.570
An exclusive interview with Kevin Lee on "News Nine".

464
00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:55.911
Will that be enough?

465
00:40:58.289 --> 00:41:01.300
An exclusive interview with Kevin Lee on "News Nine".

466
00:41:05.530 --> 00:41:06.629
Will that be enough?

467
00:41:12.209 --> 00:41:13.939
- Go Hye Ran. - Hold on.

468
00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:16.140
What did you just say?

469
00:41:18.209 --> 00:41:19.749
An exclusive interview with Kevin Lee?

470
00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:24.950
I'm planning to host it next Sunday on the day of our reorganization.

471
00:41:25.350 --> 00:41:29.760
I think I should host "News Nine" for a while longer to do that.

472
00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:48.839
Don't you think that was too absurd?

473
00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:51.709
I know you don't want to give up that position,

474
00:41:51.709 --> 00:41:54.419
but we've already decided to give it to Han Ji Won.

475
00:41:54.419 --> 00:41:55.749
Do you have specific source?

476
00:41:55.749 --> 00:41:58.120
I wouldn't say it without a hotline, Executive Director.

477
00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:00.559
Hotline. So who is the hotline?

478
00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:02.019
Han Gi Sup from "Sports Line"?

479
00:42:02.019 --> 00:42:03.660
Or Park Jang Cheol from "All That Golf"?

480
00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:04.990
What do you want me to do, sir?

481
00:42:05.359 --> 00:42:08.059
Should I get an exclusive interview with Kevin Lee or not?

482
00:42:08.059 --> 00:42:10.629
Are you joking? Of course you must get it.

483
00:42:10.830 --> 00:42:13.070
- Then what about Han Ji Won? - Hold on.

484
00:42:13.839 --> 00:42:16.740
JBC will be doing something even CNN can't do.

485
00:42:18.269 --> 00:42:21.240
Live up to your reputation as the main anchor of "News Nine".

486
00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:23.780
- But sir... - I'm sorry, but stay quiet.

487
00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:27.519
If you fail, not only will you have to resign from "News Nine",

488
00:42:27.519 --> 00:42:29.580
but you'll also have to risk your job, okay?

489
00:42:30.519 --> 00:42:31.519
Okay?

490
00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:34.359
Okay.

491
00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:40.760
You've completely gone crazy.

492
00:42:42.129 --> 00:42:44.370
You were showing off and acted like a snob.

493
00:42:44.499 --> 00:42:46.030
Are you afraid to get fired?

494
00:42:46.729 --> 00:42:49.300
How could you tell such a lie? Kevin Lee?

495
00:42:49.839 --> 00:42:51.839
Do you want to get humiliated before getting kicked out?

496
00:42:53.339 --> 00:42:57.280
I took your anchor position before you could do anything.

497
00:42:57.809 --> 00:43:00.850
The only card you took out after seven years...

498
00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:03.490
was Han Ji Won?

499
00:43:04.649 --> 00:43:08.359
Dae Woong. That's why you never succeed.

500
00:43:08.589 --> 00:43:09.919
We gave you the award yesterday.

501
00:43:11.229 --> 00:43:14.430
If we tried our best and laid a red carpet for you,

502
00:43:14.430 --> 00:43:17.169
you should know your limit and exit while waving your hand.

503
00:43:17.330 --> 00:43:19.129
That's less humiliating.

504
00:43:21.839 --> 00:43:25.839
What's really humiliating is being pushed around like you.

505
00:43:27.379 --> 00:43:31.109
I'll leave on my will and quit on my will.

506
00:43:35.649 --> 00:43:38.519
- I... - Get me data from Webdotcom.

507
00:43:38.519 --> 00:43:41.320
I'm going to monitor all the matches until now.

508
00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:45.359
- Okay. - Hey. Hold on. Wait.

509
00:44:08.519 --> 00:44:11.249
I searched everything I can including golf channels.

510
00:44:11.419 --> 00:44:12.419
Thank you.

511
00:44:13.189 --> 00:44:16.260
But do you really have a way to get a hold of him?

512
00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:18.289
No. I'll have to look for that now.

513
00:44:18.289 --> 00:44:19.359
Hye Ran.

514
00:44:20.499 --> 00:44:23.700
Was it really a lie? What are you going to do now?

515
00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:26.269
Don't worry. I'll bring him here.

516
00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:58.669
Hey. Go Hye Ran.

517
00:45:03.606 --> 00:45:04.736
Where are your manners?

518
00:45:06.606 --> 00:45:07.736
Isn't there a border?

519
00:45:08.307 --> 00:45:11.776
Why is the news station people in the sports station?

520
00:45:11.977 --> 00:45:15.376
Do you not respect me or something because we're lower than you?

521
00:45:15.376 --> 00:45:20.287
We all equally handle news. I don't care as long as I get the exclusive.

522
00:45:20.287 --> 00:45:23.017
Right. You're Go Hye Ran.

523
00:45:23.657 --> 00:45:25.557
I forgot.

524
00:45:27.227 --> 00:45:30.697
How did you change Chief Jang's decision this time?

525
00:45:31.626 --> 00:45:35.836
- What is that supposed to mean? - Right. You're famous for it.

526
00:45:36.197 --> 00:45:38.506
You give what you have to give...

527
00:45:38.506 --> 00:45:41.307
and take what you have to take.

528
00:45:45.546 --> 00:45:46.577
What?

529
00:45:47.977 --> 00:45:48.977
You're right.

530
00:45:49.677 --> 00:45:52.046
I'm famous for that.

531
00:45:52.887 --> 00:45:56.387
I give my skill and be acknowledged by it.

532
00:45:56.456 --> 00:45:59.256
You're still out in the field at that age...

533
00:45:59.256 --> 00:46:00.497
because you can't do that.

534
00:46:00.727 --> 00:46:01.827
What did you just say?

535
00:46:01.827 --> 00:46:04.727
If you're a senior, act like a senior.

536
00:46:05.666 --> 00:46:09.566
You should show your skills or at least be noble.

537
00:46:09.896 --> 00:46:12.436
You're so childish.

538
00:46:14.836 --> 00:46:15.836
Why you little...

539
00:46:19.206 --> 00:46:20.447
What are you looking at?

540
00:46:49.137 --> 00:46:50.146
Clean that up.

541
00:46:50.847 --> 00:46:53.577
It's not "Clean that up."

542
00:46:55.146 --> 00:46:56.617
It's "I'm sorry."

543
00:46:58.717 --> 00:46:59.787
You should...

544
00:47:01.387 --> 00:47:02.486
apologize to me.

545
00:47:03.586 --> 00:47:09.057
For splashing water and eyeing on my position.

546
00:47:10.126 --> 00:47:15.597
You took it from someone else too.

547
00:47:17.436 --> 00:47:18.767
Were you sorry back then?

548
00:47:21.606 --> 00:47:23.077
Nothing lasts forever.

549
00:47:24.177 --> 00:47:27.276
You're not the only one who can take that position.

550
00:47:28.577 --> 00:47:30.486
Don't be so greedy at that age.

551
00:47:32.146 --> 00:47:33.217
It makes you look ugly.

552
00:47:35.756 --> 00:47:36.756
Ji Won.

553
00:47:46.227 --> 00:47:47.967
Do you think your youth is your skill?

554
00:47:48.967 --> 00:47:52.736
Are you confident about taking it if I give it to you?

555
00:47:54.376 --> 00:47:56.776
Try it if you dare.

556
00:47:59.807 --> 00:48:01.077
I will.

557
00:48:20.997 --> 00:48:23.907
Goodness. It's refreshing.

558
00:48:24.967 --> 00:48:27.537
It's always nice to empty everything, right?

559
00:48:29.537 --> 00:48:32.077
Are you on a diet? You don't look well.

560
00:48:32.606 --> 00:48:35.416
- No. - If you're over 35 as a woman,

561
00:48:35.416 --> 00:48:38.887
you should get wrinkles and a loose belly to look like a human.

562
00:48:39.787 --> 00:48:42.316
People are worried about getting old.

563
00:48:43.186 --> 00:48:46.126
I find those people ugly.

564
00:48:50.327 --> 00:48:52.296
Did I gain weight?

565
00:48:53.026 --> 00:48:54.037
Yes.

566
00:48:54.267 --> 00:48:55.467
I don't care.

567
00:48:55.836 --> 00:48:59.907
I didn't know when I was desperate, but I feel better after giving up.

568
00:49:00.206 --> 00:49:01.876
My belly may have increased by 2 inches,

569
00:49:01.876 --> 00:49:04.807
but my happiness increased by like 100 inches.

570
00:49:07.577 --> 00:49:10.747
That doesn't mean you look unfortunate.

571
00:49:11.086 --> 00:49:13.046
I heard you've been hosting a radio show lately.

572
00:49:15.686 --> 00:49:17.927
- Yes. - You're working hard.

573
00:49:19.887 --> 00:49:23.396
By the way, you're coming with your husband, right?

574
00:49:26.097 --> 00:49:29.267
My goodness. Did you not know?

575
00:49:31.037 --> 00:49:35.236
No. I knew that. We should be there together.

576
00:50:05.267 --> 00:50:06.907
You're right on time, honey.

577
00:50:12.876 --> 00:50:15.177
Goodness. They're really here together.

578
00:50:15.847 --> 00:50:16.847
Really?

579
00:50:17.316 --> 00:50:18.387
Do your best.

580
00:50:18.546 --> 00:50:19.747
We're still married.

581
00:50:20.287 --> 00:50:21.586
Show me some respect.

582
00:50:31.227 --> 00:50:32.267
Really?

583
00:50:33.566 --> 00:50:36.736
Your child looks just like your husband.

584
00:50:37.137 --> 00:50:39.436
I know. Right.

585
00:50:40.436 --> 00:50:42.006
He has dark skin because he takes after him.

586
00:50:42.006 --> 00:50:43.677
- I'm so upset. - He's like he's from Africa.

587
00:50:54.657 --> 00:50:55.856
Prosecutor Kang.

588
00:50:59.427 --> 00:51:02.827
My goodness. I make such mistakes sometimes.

589
00:51:02.927 --> 00:51:05.526
You're a lawyer now, right?

590
00:51:06.497 --> 00:51:10.307
I'm sure you're very happy.

591
00:51:10.566 --> 00:51:13.807
Hye Ran's getting more beautiful every day.

592
00:51:14.876 --> 00:51:15.907
Yes.

593
00:51:20.717 --> 00:51:21.747
Goodness.

594
00:51:22.416 --> 00:51:24.787
You two seem so happy together.

595
00:51:25.387 --> 00:51:29.017
I heard if your relationship is too good, you can't get pregnant.

596
00:51:37.126 --> 00:51:38.967
We're delaying it on purpose.

597
00:51:39.927 --> 00:51:41.537
Still. Think about your age.

598
00:51:42.037 --> 00:51:43.767
You may look young on the outside,

599
00:51:44.006 --> 00:51:46.166
but women's bodies age faster.

600
00:51:46.166 --> 00:51:49.677
I know. I was planning on working out first.

601
00:51:53.347 --> 00:51:57.146
By the way, I heard you're defending a child's father again.

602
00:51:57.646 --> 00:52:00.486
He said he feels bad about winning every time.

603
00:52:00.657 --> 00:52:02.617
He complains all the time.

604
00:52:03.117 --> 00:52:04.186
Really?

605
00:52:04.186 --> 00:52:06.626
Hey. Go easy on him.

606
00:52:06.626 --> 00:52:07.856
You'll make Tae Wook cry.

607
00:52:09.626 --> 00:52:12.827
Tae Wook. You're killing me.

608
00:52:13.227 --> 00:52:15.967
I win before I try anything.

609
00:52:17.807 --> 00:52:19.106
I feel bad for you.

610
00:52:21.206 --> 00:52:23.276
Goodness. You must be upset.

611
00:52:26.006 --> 00:52:27.146
I am upset.

612
00:52:27.847 --> 00:52:29.986
He ignores arrest warrants...

613
00:52:29.986 --> 00:52:32.247
because he's worried about the privileged class.

614
00:52:32.816 --> 00:52:36.456
I'm upset about the current social conditions...

615
00:52:36.927 --> 00:52:40.557
where law and justice kneel before the power and authority.

616
00:52:42.327 --> 00:52:45.166
Even if you win, you didn't win. So you don't feel good about it.

617
00:52:48.097 --> 00:52:51.407
I still support his belief.

618
00:52:53.506 --> 00:52:55.776
I know that he will win eventually.

619
00:52:58.606 --> 00:52:59.677
You do too, right?

620
00:53:14.431 --> 00:53:17.123
Lawyer Kang looked like he was eating shit.

621
00:53:17.123 --> 00:53:19.986
- Did you see him? - I guess they're not just rumors.

622
00:53:19.986 --> 00:53:22.495
My husband says they're separated.

623
00:53:22.495 --> 00:53:24.850
I can see why.

624
00:53:24.850 --> 00:53:27.103
I'm saying this because it's just us.

625
00:53:27.103 --> 00:53:30.446
If a woman is that successful, she must be quite tough and cunning.

626
00:53:30.446 --> 00:53:33.424
Men get tired of women like that.

627
00:53:34.674 --> 00:53:37.819
Oh, I heard that News Nine was supposed to be yours.

628
00:53:37.819 --> 00:53:41.618
I forgot about that long ago. It's all in the past.

629
00:53:41.618 --> 00:53:44.163
My family and husband come first.

630
00:53:44.163 --> 00:53:45.475
That's very cool.

631
00:53:45.475 --> 00:53:46.812
You're always so cool about it.

632
00:53:46.812 --> 00:53:48.169
You heard her before, right?

633
00:53:48.169 --> 00:53:49.770
(I want to work on my body first.)

634
00:53:50.096 --> 00:53:51.817
Who's going wait around for her?

635
00:53:52.348 --> 00:53:53.518
I'm good at imitations.

636
00:53:53.518 --> 00:53:55.279
(I want to work on my body first.)

637
00:54:53.985 --> 00:54:55.286
Couldn't you endure it?

638
00:54:55.716 --> 00:54:57.255
Did you have to show it?

639
00:54:57.556 --> 00:54:59.455
I wasn't asking for something so great.

640
00:55:00.426 --> 00:55:02.226
You could've just gotten over with it.

641
00:55:14.141 --> 00:55:16.411
A public defender? Belief?

642
00:55:17.511 --> 00:55:18.551
Justice?

643
00:55:21.181 --> 00:55:22.181
Stop joking.

644
00:55:22.781 --> 00:55:24.652
You just have no worries...

645
00:55:24.652 --> 00:55:26.962
because of your wealthy family and my big salary.

646
00:55:27.821 --> 00:55:29.622
Do you think you're so good...

647
00:55:31.531 --> 00:55:33.062
because you can show off?

648
00:55:34.462 --> 00:55:35.462
Don't be ridiculous.

649
00:55:36.462 --> 00:55:38.172
How can you defend someone...

650
00:55:38.172 --> 00:55:39.732
when you can't even read your wife's mind?

651
00:55:40.942 --> 00:55:42.502
Do you even know...

652
00:55:44.312 --> 00:55:46.471
how I live each day...

653
00:55:46.712 --> 00:55:48.542
and how I deal with your mom every time she visits...

654
00:55:48.982 --> 00:55:49.982
on my ovulation day?

655
00:55:50.281 --> 00:55:51.312
Then give up.

656
00:55:58.192 --> 00:55:59.721
You always give up so easily.

657
00:56:01.422 --> 00:56:03.161
So the baby inside you...

658
00:56:03.832 --> 00:56:05.632
Our baby who tried to be born...

659
00:56:05.692 --> 00:56:07.902
You were so merciless and firm.

660
00:56:20.611 --> 00:56:22.082
There's nothing I want from you.

661
00:56:22.882 --> 00:56:24.252
So don't ask me for anything either.

662
00:56:25.252 --> 00:56:26.622
The best thing I can do...

663
00:56:27.422 --> 00:56:29.991
is waiting until you no longer need me.

664
00:56:30.551 --> 00:56:32.551
It's my responsibility for choosing you. However,

665
00:56:34.361 --> 00:56:35.391
I won't do anything more.

666
00:57:20.641 --> 00:57:22.602
It's so hard to carry on.

667
00:58:14.052 --> 00:58:15.752
Move out of the way.

668
00:58:15.759 --> 00:58:17.259
Get her inside.

669
00:58:42.146 --> 00:58:43.285
Yes. I'm Go Hye Ran.

670
00:58:48.785 --> 00:58:51.425
- What? - Kevin Lee's on his way to Korea.

671
00:58:52.155 --> 00:58:55.495
I checked the passenger list. He's arriving in two hours.

672
00:58:56.098 --> 00:58:57.549
It's rush hour.

673
00:58:57.574 --> 00:58:59.815
Gangneung and the Olympics, it'll be very busy.

674
00:58:59.817 --> 00:59:01.768
You need to hurry before someone gets to him.

675
00:59:01.768 --> 00:59:03.036
I'll get going now.

676
00:59:03.755 --> 00:59:04.996
Let's get going.

677
00:59:04.996 --> 00:59:06.768
Okay. I'll be right there.

678
00:59:35.183 --> 00:59:36.253
Hye Ran,

679
00:59:40.554 --> 00:59:41.594
your mother...

680
00:59:45.864 --> 00:59:47.134
She went into shock.

681
00:59:47.563 --> 00:59:50.003
We did CPR,

682
00:59:51.333 --> 00:59:53.234
but I don't believe she'll last long.

683
00:59:59.503 --> 01:00:00.574
Let's go.

684
01:00:09.353 --> 01:00:10.384
Hye Ran.

685
01:00:14.023 --> 01:00:17.824
You're not the only anchor we have. There are many with talent.

686
01:00:17.824 --> 01:00:20.793
Then again, you're standing firm at that age of yours.

687
01:00:20.793 --> 01:00:24.663
Is this how you thank me for not giving your award to Han Ji Won?

688
01:00:24.663 --> 01:00:25.864
Nothing lasts forever.

689
01:00:27.804 --> 01:00:29.574
You're not the only one who can take that position.

690
01:00:29.574 --> 01:00:32.543
Live up to your reputation as the main anchor of "News Nine".

691
01:00:32.543 --> 01:00:36.014
I'll make sure that Kevin Lee appears on "News Nine".

692
01:00:36.014 --> 01:00:38.714
If you fail, not only will you have to resign from "News Nine",

693
01:00:38.714 --> 01:00:41.413
but you'll also have to risk your job, okay?

694
01:00:41.413 --> 01:00:44.884
I'll prove myself and show everyone how much I can accomplish...

695
01:00:46.054 --> 01:00:47.523
and then resign honorably.

696
01:00:51.123 --> 01:00:52.123
Hye Ran.

697
01:00:55.694 --> 01:00:56.703
I...

698
01:00:58.503 --> 01:00:59.503
I can't go.

699
01:01:01.304 --> 01:01:02.634
I need this guest for my show.

700
01:01:06.043 --> 01:01:08.214
Mom won't be brought back to life even if I go there.

701
01:01:12.683 --> 01:01:13.714
Hye Ran.

702
01:01:15.683 --> 01:01:17.853
How much more horrible can you get? When will you stop?

703
01:02:00.293 --> 01:02:02.534
(Exit to Incheon Airport)

704
01:03:44.264 --> 01:03:45.964
You've completely gone crazy.

705
01:03:45.964 --> 01:03:46.973
I know.

706
01:03:47.333 --> 01:03:48.333
Hye Ran.

707
01:03:48.603 --> 01:03:50.904
How much more horrible can you get? When will you stop?

708
01:03:51.404 --> 01:03:52.473
I know.

709
01:04:20.234 --> 01:04:21.234
Are you all right?

710
01:04:22.003 --> 01:04:23.034
I'm sorry.

711
01:04:23.804 --> 01:04:24.804
I'm fine.

712
01:05:20.194 --> 01:05:22.364
I love you, Hye Ran.

713
01:05:39.813 --> 01:05:40.984
Do you know this man?

714
01:05:46.654 --> 01:05:49.594
He's the pro golfer, Kevin Lee.

715
01:05:49.594 --> 01:05:50.994
How do you know him?

716
01:05:50.994 --> 01:05:52.694
I held his first exclusive interview.

717
01:05:52.694 --> 01:05:56.163
Did you not know him before that?

718
01:05:58.703 --> 01:05:59.703
Yes.

719
01:06:03.174 --> 01:06:04.244
I see.

720
01:06:06.773 --> 01:06:08.413
Then I believe you would know who this is as well.

721
01:06:20.754 --> 01:06:21.794
My goodness.

722
01:06:25.023 --> 01:06:28.463
It's you, Hye Ran, right? Hye Ran.

723
01:06:30.803 --> 01:06:32.164
Do you recognize her?

724
01:06:36.633 --> 01:06:37.874
That's Seo Eun Joo.

725
01:06:37.874 --> 01:06:39.343
How do you know her, Ms. Go?

726
01:06:39.343 --> 01:06:42.744
She's a friend from high school. Her name's Go Hye Ran.

727
01:06:43.074 --> 01:06:44.084
Were you two close friends?

728
01:06:44.084 --> 01:06:48.954
We were best friends. We were so close. We never stayed apart.

729
01:06:48.954 --> 01:06:51.654
No. We were only in the same class,

730
01:06:51.654 --> 01:06:55.824
I barely knew her other than her name.

731
01:06:57.124 --> 01:06:59.723
When did you find out that they were a married couple?

732
01:07:01.334 --> 01:07:05.004
Say hello, Hye Ran. This is my husband.

733
01:07:06.933 --> 01:07:09.603
Was it before holding the exclusive interview or after?

734
01:07:11.744 --> 01:07:15.044
Hello. I'm Eun Joo's husband, Kevin Lee.

735
01:07:16.273 --> 01:07:18.843
Kevin Lee?

736
01:08:04.164 --> 01:08:06.693
(Misty)

737
01:08:06.994 --> 01:08:10.164
Hello viewers. This is Han Ji Won of "News Nine".

738
01:08:10.164 --> 01:08:13.304
You know well that people don't wait long in this business.

739
01:08:13.304 --> 01:08:14.773
We aren't that patient.

740
01:08:14.773 --> 01:08:16.433
You won't have to wait long.

741
01:08:17.004 --> 01:08:20.273
Just cry. That's how you say goodbye.

742
01:08:20.313 --> 01:08:22.813
Why would I cry? If I cry, will that change anything?

743
01:08:23.113 --> 01:08:26.853
Every day is like a dream. I can't be any happier.

744
01:08:26.853 --> 01:08:28.384
How do you know him?

745
01:08:28.384 --> 01:08:31.924
You shouldn't make moves on someone else's husband, Ji Won.

746
01:08:31.924 --> 01:08:33.794
When can I meet you husband?

747
01:08:33.794 --> 01:08:36.254
I can't wait to meet him as well. Do I make you feel uncomfortable?

748
01:08:36.254 --> 01:08:38.464
Eun Joo. Would you mind...

749
01:08:39.494 --> 01:08:42.193
if I meet your husband?
