They say that they won't be able to

158
00:14:12.713 --> 00:14:14.607
search much longer
because of the bad weather.

159
00:14:15.482 --> 00:14:17.160
Tell them to search just a bit longer.

160
00:14:17.793 --> 00:14:19.059
Just a bit longer.

161
00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:18.569
Look at that.

162
00:15:18.569 --> 00:15:20.971
The birds are flying
even though it's snowing.

163
00:15:20.971 --> 00:15:23.093
You were right, Ms. Kang.

164
00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:30.806
Don't look outside.
And you can't call me "Ms. Kang."

165
00:15:30.806 --> 00:15:32.125
Oh yeah.

166
00:15:43.289 --> 00:15:46.117
<i>Something's happened at home,
so don't come here for the time being.</i>

167
00:15:46.117 --> 00:15:47.847
What is she talking about?

00:15:51.494 --> 00:15:52.540
<i>[Shin Ja Young]</i>

<i>Gangwon News.</i>

00:16:17.353 --> 00:16:19.892
<i>It happened near Baek Island Harbor.</i>

172
00:16:19.892 --> 00:16:23.344
<i>According to the testimony of
the last witness who saw Kim Hye Na</i>

173
00:16:23.344 --> 00:16:25.598
<i>- Ms. Kim had come alone...</i>
- What the...

174
00:16:25.598 --> 00:16:28.002
- Damn it.
- to Baek Island Harbor.

175
00:16:28.002 --> 00:16:29.709
<i>I will repeat this information once more.</i>

176
00:16:29.709 --> 00:16:32.145
<i>The missing child's name is Kim Hye Na.</i>

177
00:16:32.145 --> 00:16:34.055
<i>She is a first grader at
Baek Island Elementary School.</i>

178
00:16:34.055 --> 00:16:36.179
<i>And she just turned
nine years old this year.</i>

179
00:16:36.179 --> 00:16:38.791
Can you check on her
and see if she's safe for me?

180
00:16:38.791 --> 00:16:42.175
Whether she's attending school,
and getting home okay.

181
00:16:42.175 --> 00:16:44.983
I don't know. I just feel like something
will happen for some reason.

182
00:16:44.983 --> 00:16:49.540
<i>At the time of her disappearance, she was
wearing a red coat and yellow sneakers.</i>

183
00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:52.565
<i>If anyone has taken this child in
or is protecting her...</i>

184
00:16:52.565 --> 00:16:55.794
<i>The number you have
dialed does not exist.</i>

185
00:16:55.794 --> 00:16:58.231
<i>Please check the number
once more and dial again.</i>

186
00:16:58.231 --> 00:17:00.925
<i>The missing child's name
is Kim Hye Na.</i>

187
00:17:03.196 --> 00:17:06.426
Showing Hye Na's face... on T.V.?

188
00:17:06.426 --> 00:17:10.365
You must consent for us
to be able to do it, ma'am.

189
00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:15.159
It'll be much easier to
find the child if we do that.

190
00:17:16.792 --> 00:17:19.493
Weren't you looking for her
because she fell into the ocean?

191
00:17:19.493 --> 00:17:22.076
If she did fall into
the ocean, ma'am

192
00:17:22.076 --> 00:17:24.819
she'd be dead by now
even if we did find her.

193
00:17:24.819 --> 00:17:29.367
But there's a 1 in 10,000 chance
that she got lost, or taken by someone.

194
00:17:29.367 --> 00:17:31.256
And if that's the case, we need to
find her as soon as possible.

195
00:17:31.256 --> 00:17:33.251
If we don't find her
in the first 48 hours

196
00:17:33.251 --> 00:17:35.944
the chances of ever finding her are slim.

197
00:17:36.474 --> 00:17:38.605
If we report her missing

198
00:17:38.605 --> 00:17:41.821
and put your child's face on
television and on billboards

199
00:17:41.821 --> 00:17:44.098
people will take a look around
them to see if she's around.

200
00:17:44.098 --> 00:17:47.000
And if someone took her away,
it'll be much harder for them to escape...

201
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.175
No.

202
00:17:48.792 --> 00:17:50.340
My Hye Na...

203
00:17:51.031 --> 00:17:54.454
is quite a shy girl
who gets embarrassed easily.

204
00:17:54.454 --> 00:17:56.162
And I...

205
00:17:57.123 --> 00:17:59.726
can't live with having
Hye Na's face everywhere

206
00:17:59.726 --> 00:18:03.575
and having everyone find out about this.

207
00:18:10.425 --> 00:18:11.950
- Sir.
- Yeah?

208
00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:14.118
She said that she's a teacher
from Hye Na's school.

209
00:18:15.645 --> 00:18:16.870
Hello.

210
00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:19.888
What's going on?
Hye Na disappeared?

211
00:18:19.888 --> 00:18:21.454
Yes.

212
00:18:22.779 --> 00:18:25.523
Did you find out what the mother
was doing around that time?

213
00:18:25.523 --> 00:18:27.428
- Pardon?
- Why are you acting like this?

214
00:18:27.428 --> 00:18:30.028
Also, there's a man who lives with her.

215
00:18:30.028 --> 00:18:31.971
Please find out what that
man was doing at the time...

216
00:18:31.971 --> 00:18:33.705
Calm down, Honey. Okay?

217
00:18:33.705 --> 00:18:34.748
We have to leave for our honeymoon.

218
00:18:34.748 --> 00:18:37.394
How could you be talking about
that at a time like this?

219
00:18:41.885 --> 00:18:45.396
<i>[Mooryung Express]</i>

00:18:49.368 --> 00:18:51.569
We need to give you a new name.

221
00:18:52.157 --> 00:18:53.878
What name?

222
00:18:54.523 --> 00:18:57.491
Hye Na is a child
who went missing in the ocean.

223
00:18:58.874 --> 00:19:01.029
Is there a name you like?

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.413
Yoon Bok.

225
00:19:05.998 --> 00:19:07.332
Yoon Bok?

226
00:19:07.332 --> 00:19:11.459
<i>[Yoon Bok's Restaurant]
There's a person whose name is Yoon Bok.</i>

227
00:19:11.459 --> 00:19:15.099
And at their place, they have
curry and rice, omurice, donkatsu

228
00:19:15.099 --> 00:19:17.334
and they eat that
kind of stuff every day.

229
00:19:18.393 --> 00:19:20.459
So, you want to be called Yoon Bok?

230
00:19:23.754 --> 00:19:24.854
Sure.

231
00:19:25.441 --> 00:19:26.948
Try calling me that.

232
00:19:29.944 --> 00:19:31.331
Yoon Bok.

233
00:19:33.059 --> 00:19:34.571
Kim Yoon Bok.

234
00:19:34.571 --> 00:19:35.825
Yes?

235
00:19:40.102 --> 00:19:42.255
Try calling me "Mom."

236
00:19:44.396 --> 00:19:47.999
Are you my mom now, Ms. Kang?

237
00:19:50.881 --> 00:19:54.252
Even if I call you Yoon Bok from now on

238
00:19:54.252 --> 00:19:58.065
you can't become Yoon Bok
completely, right away.

239
00:19:58.065 --> 00:20:01.944
I'm sure you'll become
Yoon Bok, little by little.

240
00:20:03.531 --> 00:20:07.192
And I'm sure that I won't be able to
become Yoon Bok's mom right away, either.

241
00:20:07.192 --> 00:20:11.412
But I'll become her, little by little.
That's what I think.

242
00:20:12.358 --> 00:20:15.969
Then, one day,
you'll become Yoon Bok

243
00:20:15.969 --> 00:20:18.704
and I'll become Yoon Bok's mom.

244
00:20:19.249 --> 00:20:20.771
Don't you think so?

245
00:20:26.542 --> 00:20:30.986
But I'll call you that later.
Not right now.

246
00:20:30.986 --> 00:20:33.068
That's okay with you, right?

247
00:20:34.911 --> 00:20:36.205
Sure.

248
00:20:37.049 --> 00:20:39.581
But don't call me "Ms. Kang."

249
00:20:39.581 --> 00:20:41.813
We can't have you slipping up right now.

250
00:20:42.789 --> 00:20:44.277
All right.

251
00:21:13.296 --> 00:21:14.836
Yoon Bok.

252
00:21:15.938 --> 00:21:17.329
Yoon Bok?

253
00:21:17.329 --> 00:21:18.963
Yoon Bok!

254
00:21:26.123 --> 00:21:28.813
Where are you headed, ma'am?

255
00:21:28.813 --> 00:21:30.810
Want me to give you a ride?

256
00:21:31.945 --> 00:21:33.223
It's okay.

257
00:21:33.223 --> 00:21:36.889
How are you going to bring your kid
around when she's sleeping like that?

258
00:21:36.889 --> 00:21:39.560
Our car is waiting outside, over there.

259
00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:40.883
I'll give you a ride.

260
00:21:40.883 --> 00:21:42.342
No, it's fine.

261
00:21:42.342 --> 00:21:43.581
Oh, geez.

262
00:21:43.581 --> 00:21:45.861
Fine, then!

263
00:21:47.512 --> 00:21:49.231
All right, let's go!

264
00:21:53.611 --> 00:21:56.697
Yoon Bok?
Kim Yoon Bok!

265
00:21:57.282 --> 00:21:58.796
Yoon Bok!

266
00:22:01.076 --> 00:22:02.463
Hye Na.

267
00:22:03.435 --> 00:22:05.554
Help me, please.

268
00:22:06.448 --> 00:22:09.571
We can't go if you don't help me.

269
00:22:43.562 --> 00:22:46.415
Oh, geez.
Here, get in.

270
00:22:46.415 --> 00:22:48.147
You won't be able to
hail a cab right now.

271
00:22:48.147 --> 00:22:50.267
Get in. Come on, now.

272
00:22:50.267 --> 00:22:52.058
Hurry up and get in!

273
00:22:52.058 --> 00:22:54.511
Your child is cold!
Come on, now.

274
00:22:55.838 --> 00:22:59.225
Why are you being so stubborn
when it seems like

275
00:22:59.225 --> 00:23:01.633
you don't really have a
place to go, anyway?

276
00:23:02.215 --> 00:23:03.558
Thank you.

277
00:23:04.252 --> 00:23:07.059
But where are you headed?

278
00:23:10.207 --> 00:23:13.531
If you haven't decided on a place
to go, just come to our place.

279
00:23:13.531 --> 00:23:15.580
No, it's fine.

280
00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:17.979
If we go to the southern entrance
of Incheon Station...

281
00:23:17.979 --> 00:23:20.394
Our house is a guesthouse.

282
00:23:20.394 --> 00:23:24.031
So there may be a lot of
foreigners, but it's not a shady place.

283
00:23:24.031 --> 00:23:28.412
Or else, are you planning to wander
around in this cold with that child?

284
00:23:28.412 --> 00:23:30.111
Don't be like that,
and just come to our place.

285
00:23:30.111 --> 00:23:32.412
I'll give you a room for cheap.

286
00:23:44.146 --> 00:23:46.649
What were you doing
at the time of the incident?

287
00:23:48.095 --> 00:23:49.537
I... was at work.

288
00:23:49.537 --> 00:23:52.359
Do you usually leave your child alone?

289
00:23:53.503 --> 00:23:54.796
Detective.

290
00:23:54.796 --> 00:23:58.931
When I was young, I played outside
all day even if my mom was home.

291
00:23:58.931 --> 00:24:00.792
That's how I grew up.

292
00:24:07.618 --> 00:24:10.493
This is my store's manager's
phone number.

293
00:24:10.493 --> 00:24:14.102
They'll tell you that I was working
at the store at that time.

294
00:24:17.515 --> 00:24:20.080
Is there someone she knows at the harbor?

295
00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:24.389
No.

296
00:24:25.341 --> 00:24:27.417
Then, why do you think
she went there?

297
00:24:27.417 --> 00:24:28.625
I don't know.

298
00:24:29.284 --> 00:24:31.644
Um, ma'am, the thing
about that place is...

299
00:24:32.264 --> 00:24:35.256
it would take an adult
35 minutes to walk there.

300
00:24:35.256 --> 00:24:38.322
And if a child walked there,
I'm sure it took over an hour.

301
00:24:38.322 --> 00:24:40.236
I have three kids of my own.

302
00:24:40.236 --> 00:24:42.538
They're 12, 10, and 7.
All boys.

303
00:24:42.538 --> 00:24:44.967
But in order to make them
walk over 20 minutes

304
00:24:44.967 --> 00:24:47.389
I have to give them money,
or hit them.

305
00:24:47.389 --> 00:24:50.740
So, how is it that
she walked for an hour?

306
00:24:51.378 --> 00:24:55.120
She is a first grader, and it was
negative five degrees Celsius outside.

307
00:24:55.849 --> 00:24:58.534
That's just how my Hye Na is.

308
00:24:58.534 --> 00:25:01.316
She chases cats, only to have
her clothes torn up by them

309
00:25:01.316 --> 00:25:04.248
and gets bitten by them
when she goes to feed them.

310
00:25:04.248 --> 00:25:06.354
There was even one time
she came home after midnight

311
00:25:06.354 --> 00:25:09.322
because she wanted to count
how many mailboxes there were.

312
00:25:09.322 --> 00:25:13.250
What am I supposed to do about
the fact that she's just like that?

313
00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:16.322
Ma'am, your child might be
dead right now!

314
00:25:17.223 --> 00:25:19.899
If that's not the case,
and she's out counting mailboxes

315
00:25:19.899 --> 00:25:22.354
we have to find her,
no matter what it takes!

316
00:25:27.782 --> 00:25:30.364
Who was the person
you sent a text to earlier?

317
00:25:31.715 --> 00:25:34.906
I heard that there's a man
who lives with you two.

318
00:25:36.569 --> 00:25:39.207
That man has nothing to do with this.

319
00:25:42.261 --> 00:25:44.509
May I see your phone?

320
00:25:52.242 --> 00:25:54.242
Honey!

321
00:25:55.567 --> 00:25:58.486
I came as soon as I heard the news.
But I'm sorry I got here so late.

322
00:25:59.315 --> 00:26:02.551
Hye Na disappeared!

323
00:26:05.172 --> 00:26:06.784
Don't cry. It's okay.

324
00:26:06.784 --> 00:26:07.838
Okay?

325
00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:16.025
We don't live together.

326
00:26:16.524 --> 00:26:17.553
Um...

327
00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:20.495
it's just that I deliver
a lot of things here

328
00:26:20.495 --> 00:26:22.976
so I've stayed over at my
girlfriend's house a lot, yes.

329
00:26:22.976 --> 00:26:25.346
When was the last time you saw Hye Na?

330
00:26:25.346 --> 00:26:27.477
Last night. Um...

331
00:26:28.226 --> 00:26:30.146
My girlfriend got home late

332
00:26:30.146 --> 00:26:32.142
so I shared some kimbap with her.

333
00:26:32.675 --> 00:26:34.514
And we played hide and seek together.

334
00:26:39.233 --> 00:26:40.514
I see.

335
00:26:44.108 --> 00:26:46.518
That detective won't be
easy to deal with.

336
00:26:47.244 --> 00:26:48.813
- What do you mean?
- Hey.

337
00:26:48.813 --> 00:26:51.242
Just don't talk, all right?

338
00:26:51.242 --> 00:26:53.575
If anything, just cry.

339
00:26:53.575 --> 00:26:56.087
That's a more natural reaction
to your kid dying, after all.

340
00:26:56.087 --> 00:26:58.066
And if they ask about me

341
00:26:58.066 --> 00:27:01.807
tell them that I treated her well,
like she was my own daughter.

342
00:27:02.427 --> 00:27:03.884
Don't try to avoid talking
about me on purpose.

343
00:27:03.884 --> 00:27:05.859
Why do I need to do that?

344
00:27:05.859 --> 00:27:07.865
It's not like we killed Hye Na.

345
00:27:07.865 --> 00:27:09.352
You don't get it?

346
00:27:10.021 --> 00:27:12.380
The scars on Hye Na's body...

347
00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:14.889
will make us
the first people investigated

348
00:27:14.889 --> 00:27:16.819
whether she's found alive or dead.

349
00:27:18.959 --> 00:27:22.373
I'm not going back to jail,
no matter what.

350
00:27:22.848 --> 00:27:24.003
You got that?

351
00:27:25.690 --> 00:27:26.769
Yeah.

352
00:27:30.265 --> 00:27:34.367
<i>Ring, ring.</i>

353
00:27:34.367 --> 00:27:37.060
<i>Get out of the way.</i>

354
00:27:38.211 --> 00:27:44.681
<i>A bike is coming,
ring, ring, ring.</i>

355
00:27:44.681 --> 00:27:46.681
Ms. Kang.

356
00:27:47.635 --> 00:27:50.014
Aren't I heavy?

357
00:27:52.162 --> 00:27:53.902
You are heavy.

358
00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:58.474
So why are you holding me, then?

359
00:28:01.692 --> 00:28:03.925
Because I'm afraid that I'll lose you.

360
00:28:05.125 --> 00:28:08.668
I have to hold on to you tight
and take you all the way to Iceland.

361
00:28:09.556 --> 00:28:11.505
But I'm scared that
I'll lose you along the way.

362
00:28:12.448 --> 00:28:15.133
Today was so much fun.

363
00:28:17.139 --> 00:28:20.748
Can I buy a new "things I like"
notebook tomorrow?

364
00:28:20.748 --> 00:28:25.025
I'm trying hard to remember the
new things that I started liking today...

365
00:28:25.690 --> 00:28:27.431
but it's so hard.

366
00:28:28.329 --> 00:28:30.994
What are the new things that
you started liking today?

367
00:28:32.425 --> 00:28:36.349
A bus ticket. Small seagulls.

368
00:28:36.349 --> 00:28:38.738
Ms. Kang's scent.

369
00:28:38.738 --> 00:28:40.844
My name, Yoon Bok.

370
00:28:52.428 --> 00:28:54.278
Hey, Kang Soo Jin!

371
00:28:56.715 --> 00:28:58.715
She left already?

372
00:29:26.428 --> 00:29:29.383
Oreun-gil 72.
This is the correct place, but...

373
00:29:31.592 --> 00:29:35.102
Her mom didn't go buy herself a morning
coffee in this situation, did she?

374
00:29:35.758 --> 00:29:38.525
Just what kind of assignment
have you given me, Kang Soo Jin?

375
00:29:54.549 --> 00:29:59.549
<font color="#fcc89b">[DramaFever Ver] tvN E02 Mother</font>
<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

376
00:30:12.884 --> 00:30:15.080
Here we go!

377
00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:17.054
All right, eat this
steamed egg dish, too!

378
00:30:22.753 --> 00:30:25.566
It's good, Granny!
It tastes so good!

379
00:30:25.566 --> 00:30:26.774
It tastes so good?

380
00:30:26.774 --> 00:30:29.582
All right, honey.
Eat up, eat up!

381
00:30:29.582 --> 00:30:32.101
My mom is really good at cooking, too.

382
00:30:32.101 --> 00:30:33.221
Oh, really?

383
00:30:33.221 --> 00:30:35.334
I wonder what kinds of
dishes she's good at cooking.

384
00:30:35.334 --> 00:30:36.550
Curry and rice!

385
00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:38.419
It's the most delicious thing
in this whole world.

386
00:30:38.419 --> 00:30:41.820
Also, omurice and donkatsu.

387
00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:43.659
We're sorry for
imposing on you like this.

388
00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:47.514
We'll pay for the room and the meal.

389
00:30:52.406 --> 00:30:54.561
Are you going out to
get some fresh air again?

390
00:30:54.561 --> 00:30:56.361
Yeah.

391
00:31:02.572 --> 00:31:04.787
Look at the girls here.

392
00:31:04.787 --> 00:31:07.503
Each one of them has a story.

393
00:31:07.503 --> 00:31:10.933
So we can recognize someone
who's in need right away.

394
00:31:10.933 --> 00:31:14.417
Helping each other out isn't
an extraordinary thing, really.

395
00:31:14.417 --> 00:31:17.408
If not, we wouldn't
have been able to survive.

396
00:31:19.079 --> 00:31:21.470
May I go outside and play...

397
00:31:22.101 --> 00:31:23.409
Mom?

398
00:31:24.661 --> 00:31:26.675
Yeah, sure.

399
00:31:27.183 --> 00:31:29.652
But not for too long, Yoon Bok.

400
00:31:39.992 --> 00:31:42.125
Where are you headed?

401
00:31:42.889 --> 00:31:45.383
Do you have everything you need?

402
00:31:45.383 --> 00:31:47.773
Boat tickets, and plane tickets?

403
00:31:47.773 --> 00:31:50.275
Oh yeah, there's an
"anonymous ticket," too.

404
00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:52.573
What's that?

405
00:31:52.573 --> 00:31:57.202
You take a boat out from here,
but then transfer onto a different one.

406
00:31:57.202 --> 00:32:01.934
If you do that,
nobody will know where you went.

407
00:32:03.495 --> 00:32:05.140
Is there a way...

408
00:32:06.605 --> 00:32:09.025
that I can get a passport, by any chance?

409
00:32:09.809 --> 00:32:11.149
A child's passport.

410
00:32:11.149 --> 00:32:13.167
All right, let's go, let's go!

411
00:32:13.167 --> 00:32:14.474
Ah, you're all set?

412
00:32:14.474 --> 00:32:15.778
- Yes.
- Here.

413
00:32:15.778 --> 00:32:17.090
- I'll be back.
- All right.

414
00:32:17.090 --> 00:32:19.374
Dae Woong!
Oh, you're so precious.

415
00:32:19.374 --> 00:32:21.717
Aw, bye now!

416
00:32:24.902 --> 00:32:27.977
You lived a sheltered life and
had a nice upbringing, didn't you?

417
00:32:27.977 --> 00:32:29.842
So, how far do you think
you'll be able to get?

418
00:32:29.842 --> 00:32:33.379
It's clear as day that child isn't yours.

419
00:32:37.361 --> 00:32:39.428
You're wrong, ma'am.

420
00:32:39.428 --> 00:32:41.745
I didn't live a sheltered life.

421
00:32:41.745 --> 00:32:43.415
And she is my child.

422
00:32:43.415 --> 00:32:46.415
We'll get farther than you
could ever imagine.

423
00:32:46.415 --> 00:32:47.508
I'll bet on it.

424
00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:52.969
Oh my.

425
00:32:52.969 --> 00:32:54.892
Maybe it's because...

426
00:32:55.466 --> 00:32:57.666
I raised my kids alone,
without their father around.

427
00:32:57.666 --> 00:33:00.505
But I'm a sucker for
these kinds of stories.

428
00:33:00.505 --> 00:33:04.896
I wonder if they'll sell to you, though.
They usually won't deal with Koreans.

429
00:33:05.338 --> 00:33:07.197
Hey, yeah.
It's me, yeah.

430
00:33:07.197 --> 00:33:11.466
It's a child, and she's
about seven years old.

431
00:33:11.466 --> 00:33:14.493
And she could even pass
for eight years old.

432
00:33:14.493 --> 00:33:16.983
Well? Can we get the goods from you?

433
00:33:16.983 --> 00:33:21.409
Once you make an order,
you can't cancel it or get a refund.

434
00:33:21.409 --> 00:33:25.529
And if there's an issue while you're
leaving the country, that's your problem.

435
00:33:25.529 --> 00:33:27.234
Oh, yeah.

436
00:33:27.731 --> 00:33:29.197
Oh, you have it?

437
00:33:29.197 --> 00:33:31.375
That's great!

438
00:33:31.375 --> 00:33:33.778
Thanks, I'll come and get it. Yeah.

439
00:33:35.992 --> 00:33:38.954
But the thing is, children's
passports are quite rare...

440
00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:42.231
so they want a big one.

441
00:33:42.765 --> 00:33:45.060
A big one?

442
00:33:46.859 --> 00:33:48.477
Do you mean one million won?

443
00:33:50.368 --> 00:33:54.006
You have an unexpectedly
cute side to you.

444
00:33:58.327 --> 00:34:00.966
She said that she wasn't hit,
so how was I supposed to know?

445
00:34:01.419 --> 00:34:03.624
She was standing there,
holding her mom's hand tightly!

446
00:34:03.624 --> 00:34:06.830
She looked right into my eyes and said
multiple times that she wasn't hit!

447
00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:08.575
And she said that she wasn't lying!

448
00:34:09.104 --> 00:34:11.356
Hey, that's what she did, right?

449
00:34:11.356 --> 00:34:15.024
Everyone blames the cops
whenever something like this happens

450
00:34:15.024 --> 00:34:17.568
but it's not like you could've
done anything in that situation.

451
00:34:19.144 --> 00:34:20.350
What?

452
00:34:21.428 --> 00:34:22.555
Pardon?

453
00:34:22.555 --> 00:34:24.519
If you have something to say,
then say it, punk!

454
00:34:24.519 --> 00:34:25.655
Oh.

455
00:34:28.149 --> 00:34:29.885
It seemed to me that
they were both lying.

456
00:34:30.430 --> 00:34:32.575
Both the mom and the child.

457
00:34:32.575 --> 00:34:33.955
Both of them looked unhappy.

458
00:34:34.499 --> 00:34:35.718
Hey, you bastard.

459
00:34:35.718 --> 00:34:37.452
It's not like you did anything, either!

460
00:34:37.452 --> 00:34:39.129
Is that the first time
you saw an unhappy family?

461
00:34:39.129 --> 00:34:41.086
Why are you saying
this kind of thing now?

462
00:34:41.086 --> 00:34:43.008
Ever since I heard about
the girl going missing

463
00:34:43.008 --> 00:34:44.812
I've been thinking about...

464
00:34:45.747 --> 00:34:47.959
what I could have done back then.

465
00:34:47.959 --> 00:34:50.633
I kept getting a bad feeling
every time I visited her house

466
00:34:50.633 --> 00:34:52.861
so I think I kind of knew
things would end up this way.

467
00:34:52.861 --> 00:34:55.124
What do you mean, you knew
things would end up this way?

468
00:34:55.124 --> 00:34:56.528
This was an accident!

469
00:34:56.528 --> 00:34:59.289
It's not like the mom
pushed the kid into the ocean.

470
00:34:59.289 --> 00:35:02.216
It was an accident,
no matter how you look at it!

471
00:35:02.662 --> 00:35:04.332
Hey, to be honest,
what about you?

472
00:35:04.332 --> 00:35:06.196
Were you never hit by
your parents as a kid?

473
00:35:07.468 --> 00:35:09.015
Well, to be frank

474
00:35:09.015 --> 00:35:10.843
we don't know if the kid
would have told the truth

475
00:35:10.843 --> 00:35:13.410
even if we questioned
them separately.

476
00:35:14.381 --> 00:35:17.678
And we don't know if the kid's
situation would've improved

477
00:35:17.678 --> 00:35:20.015
if she'd told the truth
and got sent to a facility.

478
00:35:20.015 --> 00:35:22.077
Exactly, we don't know!
There's no way to know for sure!

479
00:35:22.077 --> 00:35:23.606
But you know!

480
00:35:24.339 --> 00:35:25.633
We still need to do everything we can

481
00:35:25.633 --> 00:35:27.859
since things have ended up
this way, don't we?

482
00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:31.861
Find out the time, date,
and location of the place

483
00:35:31.861 --> 00:35:33.035
where she was supposedly
hit by a baseball

484
00:35:33.035 --> 00:35:35.975
and check on all of the CCTV cameras
and dashcams that were nearby.

485
00:35:35.975 --> 00:35:37.879
As for the incident when she
supposedly tripped down some stairs

486
00:35:37.879 --> 00:35:40.676
check the date, time, location,
and even the circumstances, too.

487
00:35:41.245 --> 00:35:42.345
Whether we find her or not

488
00:35:42.345 --> 00:35:45.164
I will request a warrant if I suspect
that there was any child abuse.

489
00:35:47.385 --> 00:35:49.439
I'm sorry, Manager.

490
00:35:51.171 --> 00:35:53.417
I must be causing you so much trouble.

491
00:35:55.582 --> 00:35:56.653
I think...

492
00:35:57.180 --> 00:36:00.948
I'll be able to come back
to work in a week.

493
00:36:02.091 --> 00:36:04.716
Yes, please do that.

494
00:36:05.814 --> 00:36:07.582
Thank you.

495
00:36:08.716 --> 00:36:10.620
Yes, thank you!

496
00:36:22.187 --> 00:36:23.397
What do I do?

497
00:36:23.928 --> 00:36:26.149
I don't have any black clothes to wear.

498
00:36:28.008 --> 00:36:29.365
What if...

499
00:36:30.841 --> 00:36:32.524
Hye Na didn't die?

500
00:36:32.999 --> 00:36:34.803
Why are you being like this, too?

501
00:36:34.803 --> 00:36:36.524
Where could she be, then?

502
00:36:37.095 --> 00:36:39.303
That detective doesn't know
what he's talking about

503
00:36:39.303 --> 00:36:41.167
but she knows this neighborhood
even better than I do!

504
00:36:41.167 --> 00:36:43.914
And also, even if she were to get lost

505
00:36:43.914 --> 00:36:46.330
she knows our phone number
and our address, too!

506
00:36:46.330 --> 00:36:47.716
I think I saw her.

507
00:36:48.412 --> 00:36:49.682
Who?

508
00:36:51.075 --> 00:36:52.292
Hye Na?

509
00:36:52.292 --> 00:36:53.368
Yeah.

510
00:36:54.883 --> 00:36:56.379
No way.

511
00:36:56.874 --> 00:36:59.051
So why didn't you tell the police?

512
00:37:00.173 --> 00:37:01.763
Because I wasn't sure.

513
00:37:03.689 --> 00:37:04.910
When?

514
00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:06.189
Where?

515
00:37:06.189 --> 00:37:08.057
When you texted me yesterday...

516
00:37:09.102 --> 00:37:11.689
there was an intercity bus next to me.

517
00:37:15.553 --> 00:37:17.013
Honey.

518
00:37:17.013 --> 00:37:19.370
I make mistakes like that
all the time, too.

519
00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:24.060
After my mom died, I saw a lot of women
on the street that looked like her.

520
00:37:30.792 --> 00:37:32.908
Would you prefer that Hye Na were dead?

521
00:37:34.930 --> 00:37:36.751
How could you say that?

522
00:37:37.401 --> 00:37:39.225
Would you like it
if she never came back?

523
00:37:40.573 --> 00:37:42.856
Do I not seem sad to you, Honey?

524
00:37:43.716 --> 00:37:46.323
I feel like my head
is about to explode right now.

525
00:37:46.850 --> 00:37:48.928
I'm so scared...

526
00:37:49.691 --> 00:37:51.394
and I hate myself so much.

527
00:37:51.890 --> 00:37:53.986
Because I feel like
she died because of me.

528
00:37:54.542 --> 00:37:56.316
Well, that's a different matter.

529
00:37:58.832 --> 00:38:00.332
Right now, Hye Na is...

530
00:38:02.611 --> 00:38:05.995
better off being dead and silent...

531
00:38:06.506 --> 00:38:08.180
for everyone right now.

532
00:38:10.573 --> 00:38:11.814
What if...

533
00:38:14.292 --> 00:38:16.015
she's not dead?

534
00:38:19.305 --> 00:38:21.653
It'll become troublesome.

535
00:38:21.653 --> 00:38:23.202
Quite troublesome.

536
00:38:30.405 --> 00:38:31.843
Oh, um...

537
00:38:31.843 --> 00:38:34.557
Chief Pyo Eun Cheol?

538
00:38:35.133 --> 00:38:36.229
Yes.

539
00:38:36.229 --> 00:38:38.847
Oh, um, my name
is Park Jae Beom.

540
00:38:41.841 --> 00:38:43.392
What brings you here?

541
00:38:43.392 --> 00:38:47.091
Yes, well, I'm looking for
Ms. Kang Soo Jin.

542
00:38:47.091 --> 00:38:49.388
But she's not at school or at home.

543
00:38:50.182 --> 00:38:52.164
And her phone number
doesn't work either, right?

544
00:38:52.164 --> 00:38:53.185
Yes.

545
00:38:53.185 --> 00:38:54.555
But I must find her.

546
00:38:54.555 --> 00:38:56.167
Why, if I may ask?

547
00:38:56.664 --> 00:38:58.265
It's... about a family matter.

548
00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:02.814
Well, I don't know either.

549
00:39:02.814 --> 00:39:04.823
Her mother is quite ill.

550
00:39:07.421 --> 00:39:08.872
By "mother," do you mean...

551
00:39:08.872 --> 00:39:10.149
Um, yes.

552
00:39:10.149 --> 00:39:12.519
The actress, Cha Young Shin.

553
00:39:12.519 --> 00:39:16.084
Ms. Cha is quite ill right now.

554
00:39:16.084 --> 00:39:19.640
And she's saying that she refuses to
undergo surgery if Soo Jin doesn't come.

555
00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:25.435
The Skoma Research Center in Iceland.

556
00:39:25.435 --> 00:39:26.544
What?

557
00:39:26.544 --> 00:39:27.966
That's probably where she went.

558
00:39:27.966 --> 00:39:30.466
She said she was going there
when I last saw her.

559
00:39:31.126 --> 00:39:34.597
I don't know any way to contact her
right now either, besides by email.

560
00:39:35.102 --> 00:39:38.004
If you want, I can find the center's
address and phone number...

561
00:39:38.004 --> 00:39:39.202
Excuse me, um...

562
00:39:40.202 --> 00:39:42.839
Did you say... Iceland?

563
00:39:50.122 --> 00:39:51.845
Wait, wait.

564
00:39:54.903 --> 00:39:56.218
All right, come here.

565
00:39:58.169 --> 00:39:59.450
<i>If something goes wrong</i>

566
00:39:59.450 --> 00:40:02.127
<i>and you know some things
that you don't need to know</i>

567
00:40:02.127 --> 00:40:04.187
<i>it makes things difficult
for everyone involved.</i>

568
00:40:04.747 --> 00:40:08.149
<i>Living your life in this way
will prove to be really difficult.</i>

569
00:40:08.149 --> 00:40:10.693
<i>You need to be aware of that.</i>

570
00:40:14.272 --> 00:40:15.564
Hey!

571
00:40:15.564 --> 00:40:17.280
Huh? Oh, hello.

572
00:40:22.513 --> 00:40:25.017
All right, we're here.

573
00:40:33.972 --> 00:40:35.727
Did you bring a photo?

574
00:40:35.727 --> 00:40:36.792
No.

575
00:40:39.993 --> 00:40:41.633
Come this way. Yes.

576
00:40:48.379 --> 00:40:50.218
Take a seat over there.

577
00:41:06.314 --> 00:41:08.026
Take your hat off.

578
00:41:13.102 --> 00:41:15.091
Push your bangs back.

579
00:41:17.533 --> 00:41:19.390
Did you catch that Vietnamese woman yet?

580
00:41:20.109 --> 00:41:22.104
No, not yet. Ugh.

581
00:41:22.104 --> 00:41:24.564
I have a bad feeling.

582
00:41:24.564 --> 00:41:26.716
I took the baby and chased her
all the way to Mooryung.

583
00:41:26.716 --> 00:41:27.903
And in that weather, too.

584
00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:31.111
What's so important
about money, am I right?

585
00:41:31.111 --> 00:41:32.211
Stay still.

586
00:41:32.211 --> 00:41:35.580
Money is more important to
some than their own kids.

587
00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:39.307
Even though she knows
what I'll do with her kid.

588
00:41:39.307 --> 00:41:41.265
Did you sell the kid?

589
00:41:41.265 --> 00:41:44.173
Boys get sold almost immediately
as soon as they're put up for sale.

590
00:41:48.624 --> 00:41:49.874
All done.

591
00:41:56.868 --> 00:41:58.890
You sure are lucky, ma'am.

592
00:41:58.890 --> 00:42:02.303
Not a lot of people want children's
passports so we don't get many in

593
00:42:02.303 --> 00:42:03.981
but we got one somehow.

594
00:42:10.236 --> 00:42:11.834
You didn't bring it?

595
00:42:29.941 --> 00:42:32.196
Can't I give you this
after you give me the passport?

596
00:42:35.495 --> 00:42:38.921
Your niece sure is a
hardheaded one, Madam.

597
00:42:38.921 --> 00:42:41.568
Look at how hard
she's clutching it.

598
00:42:42.408 --> 00:42:46.251
This child has a hard time
trusting people, you see.

599
00:42:48.296 --> 00:42:49.370
Hey.

600
00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:52.943
These two aren't amateurs
who deal with just anyone.

601
00:42:52.943 --> 00:42:54.763
They ask for all the money up front

602
00:42:54.763 --> 00:42:59.564
and usually, you're left waiting
until they find the right template.

603
00:43:00.733 --> 00:43:03.680
It's only because you're here
with me that you're buying this

604
00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:05.472
as if you're shopping
at a department store.

605
00:43:05.472 --> 00:43:07.613
It's fine. Just trust them,
and leave this to them.

606
00:43:09.135 --> 00:43:11.649
We can't trust other people, either.

607
00:43:12.486 --> 00:43:14.756
Then, I'll wait here
until the passport is ready.

608
00:43:14.756 --> 00:43:16.245
Damn it!

609
00:43:16.245 --> 00:43:19.044
Is that woman a psycho, Madam?

610
00:43:19.044 --> 00:43:21.193
Why is she so slow to pick up
on what we're saying to her?

611
00:43:21.193 --> 00:43:23.278
It's only because you came with her

612
00:43:23.278 --> 00:43:25.888
that you're able to see my face right now

613
00:43:25.888 --> 00:43:29.202
talk to me, and pull out
your money in front of me!

614
00:43:29.202 --> 00:43:30.513
Do you get what I'm saying?

615
00:43:30.513 --> 00:43:32.903
You're not even supposed
to know about me at all!

616
00:43:33.597 --> 00:43:36.113
Here, take this and
wait for us to contact you.

617
00:43:38.624 --> 00:43:40.805
You'll get a text in an hour or two.

618
00:43:40.805 --> 00:43:42.082
It'll tell you where to go.

619
00:43:48.765 --> 00:43:49.939
<i>[Text Messages]</i>

00:44:11.495 --> 00:44:12.870
<i>Don't you think so?</i>

629
00:44:26.575 --> 00:44:29.964
<i>The number you have
dialed does not exist.</i>

630
00:44:29.964 --> 00:44:31.921
<i>Please check it once more
and dial again.</i>

631
00:44:33.783 --> 00:44:38.260
<i>[Marsha House]</i>

632
00:44:47.222 --> 00:44:49.030
What is it?
What's wrong?

633
00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:52.098
I miss Jjing...

634
00:44:52.098 --> 00:44:53.638
<i>This caller is unavailable...</i>

635
00:44:53.638 --> 00:44:55.412
so much.

636
00:44:57.696 --> 00:45:01.359
Jjing liked red bean buns so much.

637
00:45:01.359 --> 00:45:03.399
Put your shoes on.
We have to hurry and go.

638
00:45:43.696 --> 00:45:45.515
Are you crazy?
Move right now!

639
00:45:45.515 --> 00:45:46.658
No, I won't move!

640
00:45:46.658 --> 00:45:47.810
Give me the passport.

641
00:45:47.810 --> 00:45:50.310
Stop being crazy!
The passport isn't the problem right now!

642
00:45:50.310 --> 00:45:53.676
Everyone is about to be caught,
and they've raided the factory, too!

643
00:45:54.539 --> 00:45:55.664
What about my money?

644
00:45:56.178 --> 00:45:58.546
That? Go to the police
station get it there.

645
00:45:58.546 --> 00:46:00.490
Tell them that you were
trying to get a fake passport

646
00:46:00.490 --> 00:46:03.356
but you couldn't because of them,
so you want a refund.

647
00:46:03.356 --> 00:46:05.289
Why do you think that you're special?

648
00:46:05.289 --> 00:46:08.836
Everyone is scrambling and running away
without being able to take anything!

649
00:46:09.928 --> 00:46:11.640
Damn it all!

650
00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:13.836
Just get in, okay?
Get in, and we'll talk in the car.

651
00:46:13.836 --> 00:46:15.307
Hurry up!
Get in, get in, get in!

652
00:46:15.307 --> 00:46:16.604
Hurry up!

653
00:46:28.959 --> 00:46:30.039
Damn it.

654
00:46:30.039 --> 00:46:32.468
That Vietnamese woman
definitely reported us.

655
00:46:32.468 --> 00:46:34.702
I guess she thought she'd
get her kid back if she did this.

656
00:46:34.702 --> 00:46:35.821
I'm definitely getting my money back.

657
00:46:35.821 --> 00:46:38.441
Sure, sure, whatever! Sure!

658
00:46:45.374 --> 00:46:46.885
Where are we going?

659
00:46:48.084 --> 00:46:51.314
Well, we'll have to hide out
on an island for now.

660
00:47:07.852 --> 00:47:11.383
Wait here, okay? I have to make
some calls and buy the tickets, too.

661
00:47:19.332 --> 00:47:20.388
Excuse me.

662
00:47:21.955 --> 00:47:23.774
Run away now.

663
00:47:24.211 --> 00:47:26.452
Hurry up and run away now,
while your body is still okay

664
00:47:26.452 --> 00:47:27.995
and you have your organs intact.

665
00:47:28.997 --> 00:47:30.247
I...

666
00:47:30.818 --> 00:47:33.734
am not living a life befitting
of a human being, so I can't go.

667
00:47:34.905 --> 00:47:38.347
But what's stopping you,
when all you've lost is money?

668
00:47:39.394 --> 00:47:43.160
Once we go to the island, you won't be
able to escape as a human being.

669
00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:44.818
That goes for...

670
00:47:45.372 --> 00:47:46.714
both you and the kid.

671
00:47:50.187 --> 00:47:52.446
It'd be a shame to waste
a child's life like that.

672
00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:54.696
Mom.

673
00:48:32.405 --> 00:48:33.892
Are you crying?

674
00:48:34.796 --> 00:48:36.899
Can you not talk to me for a bit?

675
00:49:04.448 --> 00:49:05.910
Yoon Bok.

676
00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:09.026
Yoon Bok!

677
00:49:27.691 --> 00:49:28.986
Yoon Bok.

678
00:49:30.553 --> 00:49:31.917
Yoon Bok!

679
00:49:34.211 --> 00:49:36.669
Yoon Bok! Yoon Bok!

680
00:49:36.669 --> 00:49:37.852
Hye Na!

681
00:49:46.388 --> 00:49:48.240
Are you okay now?

682
00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:49.966
I'm sorry.

683
00:49:49.966 --> 00:49:51.966
I wasn't mad at you.

684
00:49:51.966 --> 00:49:53.919
I was mad at myself.

685
00:49:53.919 --> 00:49:55.187
I know.

686
00:49:55.633 --> 00:49:59.466
You really wanted to go
to Iceland, right?

687
00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:05.894
If I weren't here,
you would've left by now, right?

688
00:50:21.955 --> 00:50:24.126
We'll take things slowly,
and move forward.

689
00:50:24.126 --> 00:50:26.593
I'll find a way, no matter what.

690
00:50:26.593 --> 00:50:30.155
I'm not scared, Mom.

691
00:50:37.015 --> 00:50:39.336
So I'm the only one who
needs to become brave now.

692
00:50:51.227 --> 00:50:55.359
But, can't we walk a bit more slowly?

693
00:50:55.939 --> 00:50:57.118
Yeah.

694
00:50:57.631 --> 00:50:58.876
I'm sorry.

695
00:50:58.876 --> 00:51:00.113
Let's go.

696
00:51:11.488 --> 00:51:13.852
This wasn't an accident.
This was a murder.

697
00:51:13.852 --> 00:51:16.397
The school,
Child Protective Services, and the police

698
00:51:16.397 --> 00:51:18.332
were all bystanders to this crime.

699
00:51:18.332 --> 00:51:21.582
There wasn't a single person
who expressed interest in Hye Na

700
00:51:21.582 --> 00:51:23.486
while she was alive.

701
00:51:26.332 --> 00:51:28.696
Everything is written down there.

702
00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:30.834
I...

703
00:51:31.446 --> 00:51:33.850
am going to leave for my honeymoon.

704
00:51:33.850 --> 00:51:35.303
But I'm going to keep my eye on you.

705
00:51:35.303 --> 00:51:38.124
This will be the first place
I visit after I get back.

706
00:51:38.124 --> 00:51:40.461
And when I do, you'll have to
have some answers for me.

707
00:51:40.461 --> 00:51:43.124
People tell me that I'm quite stubborn.

708
00:51:43.124 --> 00:51:46.736
Wow, you did a great job
putting this all together.

709
00:51:46.736 --> 00:51:49.205
You must have been an excellent
student, back in school.

710
00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:52.209
But, you know.

711
00:51:52.209 --> 00:51:55.227
There's one thing
you're mistaken about.

712
00:51:55.227 --> 00:51:57.214
<i>[Chooncheon]</i>

713
00:51:57.214 --> 00:51:58.807
Chooncheon.

714
00:52:16.118 --> 00:52:17.187
Let's go.

715
00:52:19.245 --> 00:52:21.075
<i>All of the veteran detectives here</i>

716
00:52:21.075 --> 00:52:24.182
hate having to deal with
cases that involve children.

717
00:52:24.182 --> 00:52:26.269
If they worked so hard to find the child

718
00:52:26.269 --> 00:52:30.667
but the child's body turned up
in a steel barrel filled with cement

719
00:52:30.667 --> 00:52:32.504
how do you think that
would make them feel?

720
00:52:32.609 --> 00:52:34.810
It'd made you lose your
appetite in a heartbeat.

721
00:52:34.810 --> 00:52:37.374
But what if they're
never able to find the kid?

722
00:52:38.533 --> 00:52:39.676
I...

723
00:52:40.334 --> 00:52:42.068
don't think this was an accident.

724
00:52:42.068 --> 00:52:44.343
If no body has turned up,
it's a missing persons case.

725
00:52:45.885 --> 00:52:48.030
I will tear this case apart
with my bare teeth

726
00:52:48.030 --> 00:52:52.816
until I see Hye Na,
alive or dead, with my own eyes.

727
00:52:55.138 --> 00:52:59.062
People call me vile...

728
00:52:59.767 --> 00:53:02.981
because I sink my teeth into things
really hard, and don't let go.

729
00:53:09.814 --> 00:53:11.551
A long time ago...

730
00:53:12.591 --> 00:53:15.861
there was a baby rabbit
that wanted to run away.

731
00:53:16.917 --> 00:53:18.310
"Mom."

732
00:53:19.205 --> 00:53:21.747
"I'm going to run away."

733
00:53:22.921 --> 00:53:25.214
When the baby rabbit said that,
the mother rabbit said...

734
00:53:26.209 --> 00:53:30.403
"If you run away,
I'll come after you."

735
00:53:30.917 --> 00:53:34.091
"Because you are my cute child."

736
00:53:35.966 --> 00:53:38.459
Then, the baby rabbit said...

737
00:53:39.685 --> 00:53:43.801
"Then, I'll become a fish
and swim away."

738
00:53:43.801 --> 00:53:46.464
Then, the mother rabbit said...

739
00:53:47.236 --> 00:53:49.705
"If you become a fish..."

740
00:53:50.256 --> 00:53:53.609
"I'll become a fisherman, and..."

741
00:53:54.191 --> 00:53:55.260
Bam!

742
00:53:56.185 --> 00:53:57.560
"I'll catch you."

743
00:54:04.176 --> 00:54:06.019
<i>Stop it!</i>

744
00:54:06.019 --> 00:54:07.019
Hey!

745
00:54:07.517 --> 00:54:08.912
Granny!

746
00:54:10.995 --> 00:54:13.493
What are you doing in the
middle of a meal? Hurry up and sit.

747
00:54:20.787 --> 00:54:22.394
I'm back.

748
00:54:22.394 --> 00:54:23.452
Oh, hello.

749
00:54:23.452 --> 00:54:24.555
Yes.

750
00:54:25.254 --> 00:54:26.946
Yeah, good work.

751
00:54:26.946 --> 00:54:30.062
I'm sorry that I came back alone.

752
00:54:31.350 --> 00:54:34.274
Oh, I don't have much
of an appetite today.

753
00:54:48.901 --> 00:54:51.019
They're going to leave me
in the dark again?

754
00:54:52.611 --> 00:54:53.950
- Hey!
- Whoa!

755
00:54:53.950 --> 00:54:55.943
Don't eat if you two
are going to mess around!

756
00:55:01.314 --> 00:55:04.459
Can't I just rest a week
before I go there?

757
00:55:04.872 --> 00:55:07.104
It's not like it's Japan or China.

758
00:55:07.104 --> 00:55:09.488
I'm so, so tired!

759
00:55:09.488 --> 00:55:12.847
Yeah, I'd like that, too.

760
00:55:12.847 --> 00:55:16.051
I want to tell my cancer cells to
stop multiplying for just a week.

761
00:55:16.051 --> 00:55:19.158
Geez, why do you have to
say things like that?

762
00:55:20.796 --> 00:55:22.756
Get me a business class seat.

763
00:55:22.756 --> 00:55:26.972
Why did Soo Jin have to go to
Iceland, of all places? Iceland!

764
00:55:26.972 --> 00:55:29.392
There aren't even any
direct flights going there!

765
00:55:29.952 --> 00:55:31.071
Um, Ma'am.

766
00:55:34.385 --> 00:55:35.390
Yeah.

767
00:55:36.276 --> 00:55:38.301
No.

768
00:55:39.722 --> 00:55:43.334
They keep talking among themselves.
Something is definitely up.

769
00:55:43.334 --> 00:55:44.765
Do you know anything about this?

770
00:55:44.765 --> 00:55:46.921
<i>I'll call you later, Big Sis.</i>

771
00:55:47.575 --> 00:55:48.832
Yes, Senior?

772
00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:54.421
About the stabbing that occurred at the
illegal gambling facility this morning.

773
00:55:54.421 --> 00:55:57.301
Two people with critical injuries and
six with minor ones are in the hospital.

774
00:55:57.301 --> 00:55:58.544
And there were no casualties.

775
00:55:58.544 --> 00:56:00.751
<i>If there are no casualties,
then whatever. Next.</i>

776
00:56:01.615 --> 00:56:04.562
About the missing girl who fell into
the ocean yesterday in Mooryung.

777
00:56:04.562 --> 00:56:06.339
They say that they
still haven't found her.

778
00:56:06.810 --> 00:56:10.185
Um... it's been 27 hours now.

779
00:56:10.185 --> 00:56:11.772
Do you have a photo of the kid?

780
00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:13.466
No.

781
00:56:13.990 --> 00:56:15.227
If not, then whatever.

782
00:56:15.227 --> 00:56:16.265
Next.

783
00:56:16.823 --> 00:56:18.725
Today, in the city of Gumi

784
00:56:18.725 --> 00:56:21.676
a woman in her thirties
was kidnapped.

785
00:56:28.245 --> 00:56:30.001
Mom.

786
00:56:30.001 --> 00:56:31.629
Yeah?

787
00:56:32.999 --> 00:56:35.448
Did your mom...

788
00:56:35.448 --> 00:56:38.385
tell you stories
before you fell asleep?

789
00:56:41.077 --> 00:56:42.140
Yeah.

790
00:56:42.859 --> 00:56:45.202
Then, did you also think to yourself...

791
00:56:46.533 --> 00:56:49.698
"Ah, this is nice..."

792
00:56:50.245 --> 00:56:52.979
as you fell asleep?

793
00:56:55.071 --> 00:56:56.575
No.

794
00:56:57.408 --> 00:56:59.106
I...

795
00:57:00.553 --> 00:57:02.249
was thinking, "I'm sorry"

796
00:57:03.017 --> 00:57:05.015
as I fell asleep.

797
00:57:10.789 --> 00:57:12.307
Why?

798
00:57:14.930 --> 00:57:17.109
Because I...

799
00:57:19.883 --> 00:57:23.093
wasn't my mom's real daughter.

800
00:57:25.622 --> 00:57:26.693
I...

801
00:57:28.267 --> 00:57:30.738
was adopted.

802
00:57:54.064 --> 00:57:57.593
<i>The Rose of Sharon has bloomed!</i>

803
00:57:58.495 --> 00:58:02.979
<i>The Rose of Sharon has bloomed!</i>

804
00:58:18.551 --> 00:58:19.854
Oh, my child.

805
00:58:19.854 --> 00:58:20.970
Let's go.

806
00:58:24.718 --> 00:58:27.028
Stop it! Stop it!

807
00:58:27.028 --> 00:58:28.368
- Oh.
- Stop it!

808
00:58:28.368 --> 00:58:31.580
- All right, I'm sorry. Don't cry.
- Stop it! Stop it!

809
00:58:31.580 --> 00:58:34.046
It's okay, it's okay!
Don't cry, child!

810
00:58:52.952 --> 00:58:54.115
Here.

811
00:59:20.932 --> 00:59:22.995
My name is...

812
00:59:24.763 --> 00:59:26.810
Nam Soo Jin.

813
01:00:15.564 --> 01:00:21.767
