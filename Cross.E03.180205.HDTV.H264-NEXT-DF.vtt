<i>[Cross]</i>

3
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.304
<i>[The characters, groups, places and
situations in this drama are fictional.]</i>

4
00:00:20.404 --> 00:00:24.014
You would've become a specialist
in just a few months, why did you quit?

5
00:00:24.014 --> 00:00:25.815
It didn't fit my character.

6
00:00:26.325 --> 00:00:30.325
<i>I'm different from other doctors.
I didn't become a doctor to save people.</i>

7
00:00:30.325 --> 00:00:32.923
<i>I did it to kill, to get revenge.</i>

8
00:00:32.923 --> 00:00:36.344
<i>- All of his organs were extracted.</i>
- Hey, Punk! Hey!

9
00:00:36.344 --> 00:00:38.697
Bring back my dad! Bring back my dad!

10
00:00:38.697 --> 00:00:41.511
You must know about
the crime I committed then.

11
00:00:41.511 --> 00:00:45.779
A log business. I'm talking
about organ trade, you stuffy punk.

12
00:00:54.033 --> 00:00:56.834
Doctor, please save my sister.

13
00:00:56.834 --> 00:01:00.262
Okay, let's go inside. Let's go.

14
00:01:00.262 --> 00:01:04.687
<i>What do I have to do to become
a doctor? I want to be a doctor like you.</i>

15
00:01:04.687 --> 00:01:07.884
Are you going to ruin your life
because of a grudge?

16
00:01:07.884 --> 00:01:10.318
My life is already over anyway.

17
00:01:10.318 --> 00:01:14.387
After my father passed away,
the day that In Joo died...

18
00:01:14.387 --> 00:01:18.214
Why did you donate her organs
without my permission? Why?

19
00:01:18.214 --> 00:01:21.468
The reason you had to rush to do the
surgery. Your motive behind adopting us.

20
00:01:21.468 --> 00:01:22.869
- Kang In Kyu!
- Prison guards!

21
00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.243
<i>I can't forgive the man
who killed my father...</i>

22
00:01:25.243 --> 00:01:28.862
<i>but I can't forgive you
for what you did to In Joo either.</i>

23
00:01:28.862 --> 00:01:31.843
<i>I'm going to get my revenge
in the cruelest, most painful way.</i>

24
00:01:31.843 --> 00:01:35.405
<i>I told you, I wanted her to keep alive,
even if it was in someone else's body.</i>

25
00:01:35.405 --> 00:01:40.178
Think about how In Joo and your father
would have wanted you to live your life.

26
00:01:40.178 --> 00:01:44.390
And why you wanted
to become a doctor in the first place.

27
00:01:48.554 --> 00:01:51.865
Help! There's a pregnant woman
and a child in this car!

28
00:01:56.815 --> 00:02:00.013
<i>[Episode 3]</i>

29
00:02:09.283 --> 00:02:11.526
<i>She's pregnant with her second child.</i>

30
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.312
<i>This is my daughter.</i>

31
00:02:15.312 --> 00:02:18.375
<i>And this child is my granddaughter.</i>

32
00:02:21.033 --> 00:02:23.853
<i>My daughter's going to visit me today.</i>

33
00:02:23.853 --> 00:02:28.027
When she gets here,
I'll explain it to her

34
00:02:28.527 --> 00:02:30.490
<i>and tell her not to be too sad.</i>

35
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.644
Excuse me! Wake up! Wake up!

36
00:02:42.661 --> 00:02:46.279
Don't move! Please stay still!
Wait, don't move!

37
00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:48.286
Please don't move!

38
00:02:49.954 --> 00:02:52.954
- Sir, can you move your leg?
- Yes.

39
00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:58.718
Then don't move, and wait
until the ambulance arrives.

40
00:03:18.561 --> 00:03:21.918
Ho... Honey, are you okay?

41
00:03:21.918 --> 00:03:24.068
No, don't move!

42
00:03:26.037 --> 00:03:29.061
- Are you her husband?
- Yes.

43
00:03:29.061 --> 00:03:31.672
- Does she have a cardiac disorder?
- No.

44
00:03:31.672 --> 00:03:34.376
- What about asthma?
- No.

45
00:03:36.591 --> 00:03:39.640
Please don't move and wait just a moment.

46
00:03:41.663 --> 00:03:43.601
She's convulsing.

47
00:03:43.601 --> 00:03:46.687
- What the heck?
- What do we do? What do we do?

48
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.768
Please pass me the airway.

49
00:04:17.768 --> 00:04:19.890
- Are you a doctor?
- Yes.

50
00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.547
- How's her oxygen saturation?
- It's about 80 percent.

51
00:04:36.869 --> 00:04:39.616
<i>It's not pneumothorax or hemothorax</i>

52
00:04:39.616 --> 00:04:42.364
<i>so why is her heartbeat getting weaker?</i>

53
00:04:42.364 --> 00:04:44.840
<i>Her blood pressure is low too.</i>

54
00:04:54.496 --> 00:04:56.895
<i>Her jugular vein is swollen.</i>

55
00:04:57.989 --> 00:04:59.854
<i>It's a cardiac tamponade.</i> (Fluid buildup,
causes compression of the heart.)

56
00:04:59.854 --> 00:05:01.506
Let's get her in the ambulance.

57
00:05:13.547 --> 00:05:15.458
Please take care of her.

58
00:05:18.938 --> 00:05:20.792
At this rate, she won't
survive for too long.

59
00:05:20.792 --> 00:05:23.164
It's a cardiac tamponade.
Please give me a 16 gauge needle.

60
00:05:23.164 --> 00:05:25.607
- Are you going to do that now?
- Yes.

61
00:05:25.607 --> 00:05:29.383
I can't allow that.
Which hospital are you affiliated with?

62
00:05:31.032 --> 00:05:32.364
Why? What's the matter?

63
00:05:32.364 --> 00:05:35.482
It's regulation to go to your hospital
so that we won't be held responsible.

64
00:05:35.482 --> 00:05:38.655
We're required to transfer patients
to a medical institution, not a doctor.

65
00:05:38.655 --> 00:05:40.869
But we have to perform
a pericardiocentesis right away!

66
00:05:40.869 --> 00:05:42.715
Is it a cardiac tamponade?

67
00:05:44.253 --> 00:05:45.253
Are you certain?

68
00:05:45.253 --> 00:05:48.160
Decreased blood pressure, jugular vein
enlargement, and cardiac sound reduction.

69
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.030
If her symptoms meet the criteria for all
of Beck's triad, it's cardiac tamponade.

70
00:05:53.066 --> 00:05:58.325
And she's the daughter of Baek Gyu Sang,
who signed on to be an organ doctor.

71
00:06:15.285 --> 00:06:17.804
Please head to
Sunrim Hospital right away.

72
00:06:17.804 --> 00:06:19.727
I'll take responsibility for her.

73
00:06:20.465 --> 00:06:22.626
You can do it on the way there, right?

74
00:06:22.626 --> 00:06:25.071
You said we don't have time!

75
00:06:34.854 --> 00:06:36.583
Yes, this is Go Ji In
from the transplant center

76
00:06:36.583 --> 00:06:38.460
reporting a TA emergency
for a pregnant woman.

77
00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.753
There's a lot of bleeding, and it's
suspected that it's a cardiac tamponade.

78
00:06:41.753 --> 00:06:43.061
Her BP is unstable as well.

79
00:06:43.061 --> 00:06:46.191
Please call C.S. and OBGY

80
00:06:46.191 --> 00:06:50.068
and prepare an operating room
for us to use after the examination.

81
00:08:14.133 --> 00:08:15.864
Her blood pressure is rising.

82
00:08:24.204 --> 00:08:26.018
Please pass me the stethoscope.

83
00:08:33.014 --> 00:08:34.598
How's the baby?

84
00:08:37.508 --> 00:08:39.281
I think it's okay.

85
00:08:46.454 --> 00:08:49.183
- Chief Choi.
- Yes?

86
00:08:49.183 --> 00:08:51.254
Isn't my daughter here yet?

87
00:08:51.254 --> 00:08:54.820
She's late, huh? I haven't
gotten a call from downstairs yet.

88
00:08:58.305 --> 00:09:00.361
Please wait just a bit longer.

89
00:09:00.361 --> 00:09:03.305
There's still some
time left for visiting hours.

90
00:09:08.771 --> 00:09:10.841
<i>Dad.</i>

91
00:09:10.841 --> 00:09:14.423
<i>Congrats on getting a second grandchild.</i>

92
00:09:14.423 --> 00:09:18.047
<i>We're always by your side, Dad.</i>

93
00:09:18.754 --> 00:09:20.834
<i>I love you, Dad.</i>

94
00:09:30.781 --> 00:09:33.320
- What happened here?
- His arms keep swelling.

95
00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.723
Really?

96
00:09:38.088 --> 00:09:39.617
Does it hurt?

97
00:09:42.162 --> 00:09:44.662
- I'll conduct a sonography.
- Okay.

98
00:09:50.305 --> 00:09:53.373
This is a pregnant TA patient!
It's an emergency!

99
00:09:53.373 --> 00:09:54.965
Is Doctor Yoon here?

100
00:09:54.965 --> 00:09:58.165
Is there an obstetrician
at this hospital?

101
00:10:20.427 --> 00:10:23.243
Doctor, what should we do
about this patient?

102
00:10:24.532 --> 00:10:27.792
Oh, arrange an emergency
orthopedic surgery.

103
00:10:27.792 --> 00:10:29.065
Okay, I'll do that.

104
00:10:29.565 --> 00:10:32.911
- I'll try calling him again.
- Doctor Yoon is in surgery.

105
00:10:32.911 --> 00:10:35.538
What do we do then? We don't
have time to transfer her.

106
00:10:35.538 --> 00:10:38.409
Let's intubate her
and connect her to a ventilator.

107
00:10:38.409 --> 00:10:40.588
- Are you a doctor?
- Yes.

108
00:10:40.588 --> 00:10:42.274
He was at the scene of the accident.

109
00:10:42.274 --> 00:10:44.718
- Which department?
- I'm a doctor of general surgery.

110
00:10:44.718 --> 00:10:45.854
Did you do this yourself?

111
00:10:45.854 --> 00:10:48.321
She had a cardiac tamponade,
she might have abdominal injuries

112
00:10:48.321 --> 00:10:51.401
and the baby's heart is still beating,
but we can't be reassured just yet.

113
00:10:51.401 --> 00:10:53.505
Let's conduct an
ultrasonic cardiogram then.

114
00:11:02.865 --> 00:11:05.865
Thankfully, she doesn't seem
to have any active bleeding...

115
00:11:06.365 --> 00:11:08.925
but her heart rate is still weak.

116
00:11:08.925 --> 00:11:10.625
I'll look at the baby.

117
00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:18.469
The baby seems to be around 32 weeks old.

118
00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:24.590
Oh my, Doctor, she's bleeding!

119
00:11:31.427 --> 00:11:33.082
- Give me epinephrine! Hurry!
- Okay.

120
00:11:33.082 --> 00:11:34.883
- Start CPR!
- Okay.

121
00:11:44.071 --> 00:11:45.497
Here.

122
00:11:57.365 --> 00:11:59.864
We must perform a C-section. Hurry!

123
00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:05.117
Dad, come to the ER.

124
00:12:05.117 --> 00:12:07.651
A pregnant TA patient
has gone into cardiac arrest.

125
00:12:08.154 --> 00:12:10.579
It's because the obstetrician
is in surgery right now!

126
00:12:10.579 --> 00:12:15.079
Is everything else okay?
Okay, I'll call you back then.

127
00:12:17.409 --> 00:12:19.838
Where is he running off to?

128
00:12:20.504 --> 00:12:22.240
He's heading to the ER.

129
00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.930
Wait, why is Center Chief
of Transplants going to the ER?

130
00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:26.907
Do you think...

131
00:12:26.907 --> 00:12:29.080
it's a TA patient?

132
00:12:29.754 --> 00:12:31.026
A brain-death?

133
00:12:50.992 --> 00:12:53.551
Who are you? I've never seen you before.

134
00:12:53.551 --> 00:12:54.882
What happened?

135
00:12:54.882 --> 00:12:57.683
The thing is, he was the doctor
at the scene of the accident...

136
00:12:57.683 --> 00:13:00.840
Who are you to practice
in someone else's hospital?

137
00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:04.171
Is that important
when the patient's life is at risk?

138
00:13:04.171 --> 00:13:07.758
- If you're not medical staff, get out.
- Wait, who are you telling to get out?

139
00:13:07.758 --> 00:13:09.575
He's the one that should get out.

140
00:13:09.575 --> 00:13:12.344
- Get out of here!
- I told you to get out!

141
00:13:12.344 --> 00:13:13.776
Get out!

142
00:13:13.776 --> 00:13:16.856
Why aren't you getting him out of here?

143
00:13:16.856 --> 00:13:18.257
Security!

144
00:13:19.888 --> 00:13:21.873
Get this person out of here!

145
00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:27.941
It's been two minutes since
she went into arrest due to TA trauma

146
00:13:27.941 --> 00:13:30.878
so if she doesn't have a laparotomy
soon, both mother and child will die!

147
00:13:30.878 --> 00:13:33.032
- Why aren't you getting him out of here?
- Yes, Sir.

148
00:13:33.032 --> 00:13:34.749
Wait!

149
00:13:34.749 --> 00:13:37.377
Like you said, she has to undergo
a laparotomy immediately.

150
00:13:37.377 --> 00:13:40.075
- Can you help?
- Yes.

151
00:13:40.681 --> 00:13:43.258
Let's take her upstairs.
Find an operating room for her.

152
00:13:43.258 --> 00:13:44.508
Okay.

153
00:13:51.479 --> 00:13:54.768
Yeon Hee, he's an external doctor.

154
00:13:54.768 --> 00:13:58.090
- If a problem arises...
- I'll take responsibility...

That's very likely.

Yes, he's in the ER.

251
00:24:59.607 --> 00:25:04.264
Check if she has family who can do
a raw liver transplant, just in case.

252

- Okay.
- Do it as soon as possible.

Is her husband unable to do it?

313
00:30:01.548 --> 00:30:03.771
No, it's no that.

314
00:30:03.771 --> 00:30:07.191
I'm just curious about whether
or not he'd be able to come out.

315
00:30:07.191 --> 00:30:11.011
If you have this much time,
shouldn't you talk to her husband first?

316
00:30:11.011 --> 00:30:14.382
- I know that too.
- If you know that

317
00:30:14.382 --> 00:30:15.797
then why are you here?

318
00:30:15.797 --> 00:30:20.021
That's why I'm going to the
first floor right now. To the ER.

319
00:30:26.213 --> 00:30:28.963
- Tell me the truth.
- About what?

320
00:30:28.963 --> 00:30:31.572
How do you know the center chief?

321
00:30:31.572 --> 00:30:35.182
- That again?
- You're not just acquaintances, are you?

322
00:30:39.148 --> 00:30:42.008
Why are you looking at me like that?

323
00:30:43.273 --> 00:30:45.941
Because I find you pathetic.

324
00:30:45.941 --> 00:30:48.700
Pa... pathetic?

325
00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:50.200
Wow.

326
00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:54.305
If you knew who I was,
you wouldn't act so high and mighty.

327
00:30:54.305 --> 00:30:58.019
Don't tell me. I'm not interested.

328
00:31:04.848 --> 00:31:08.530
I'll press this emergency button.
It seems like you're busy

329
00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:10.311
but we could get stuck in here.

330
00:31:10.311 --> 00:31:11.874
Boom!

331
00:31:17.048 --> 00:31:18.514
I'll...

332
00:31:33.926 --> 00:31:36.386
- That's not what I...
<i>- What's the matter? This is security.</i>

333
00:31:36.386 --> 00:31:39.348
Oh, I'm sorry. I pressed it by accident.

334
00:31:39.348 --> 00:31:41.982
This is weird. What's going on? Wait...

335
00:31:41.982 --> 00:31:43.982
Hey, wait...

336
00:31:46.023 --> 00:31:49.120
Oh, excuse me! Wait...

337
00:31:52.348 --> 00:31:56.561
Hey, wait! Excuse me! Hold on! Hey!

338
00:31:57.848 --> 00:32:01.050
Gosh, what a jerk!

But the thing is, with extraction,
accidents happen sometimes.

341
00:32:20.143 --> 00:32:23.239
Which is a shame, considering that's
the most important part of our business.

342
00:32:23.239 --> 00:32:26.513
Didn't you say you worked
at a major hospital before you came here?

343
00:32:26.513 --> 00:32:29.300
- Which department?
- I specialize in surgery.

Did you look into it?

00:33:21.355 --> 00:33:24.444
He was at the Myungin University
Hospital before he came here.

350
00:33:24.444 --> 00:33:27.780
He quit in his fourth year
of residency as a surgeon.

351
00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:30.724
- Why did he quit in his fourth year?
- No one knows the exact reason

352
00:33:30.724 --> 00:33:34.242
but they said that he just left his
resignation letter one day and left.

353
00:33:34.242 --> 00:33:36.242
Why? Did he make a mistake?

354
00:33:36.242 --> 00:33:40.075
No, they said that he was really skilled.

355
00:33:40.075 --> 00:33:43.379
- What about his personal life?
- I think he's troubled

356
00:33:43.379 --> 00:33:45.600
because of his big debt.

357
00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:47.308
Debt?

358
00:33:52.856 --> 00:33:54.874
What about Yeon Jang?

359
00:33:54.874 --> 00:33:58.874
I'm looking for Yeon Jang right now.

360
00:34:00.401 --> 00:34:02.736
Do your best to find whatever you can.

361
00:34:04.848 --> 00:34:08.555
I can't let such
high-quality talent go to waste.

362
00:34:13.897 --> 00:34:16.629
Let's use him once, as a hidden card.

363
00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:19.550
Okay.

364
00:34:23.450 --> 00:34:27.240
What about my wife? Is she okay?

365
00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:29.647
We performed a C-section

366
00:34:29.647 --> 00:34:32.647
but both the mother
and the baby are still unstable.

367
00:34:33.914 --> 00:34:36.164
Where are they? I need to see them.

368
00:34:36.164 --> 00:34:38.751
Your wife's condition
is still too unstable

369
00:34:38.751 --> 00:34:41.269
and you need to get some rest too.

370
00:34:45.167 --> 00:34:47.187
But more importantly...

371
00:34:47.187 --> 00:34:50.060
your wife underwent surgery
for hepatorrhexis (liver rupture)

372
00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:52.899
but she's at high risk
for hepatic failure.

373
00:34:52.901 --> 00:34:54.271
Hepatic failure?

374
00:34:54.271 --> 00:34:57.021
Her liver function is down

375
00:34:57.021 --> 00:35:02.149
so if it doesn't improve,
a liver transplant will be the only way.

376
00:35:02.149 --> 00:35:04.950
Use mine. I'll donate mine.

377
00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:08.506
I heard that you can live with
as little as a third of your liver

378
00:35:08.506 --> 00:35:10.435
and you don't need
to have the same blood type.

379
00:35:10.435 --> 00:35:13.736
That's true, but your wife

380
00:35:13.736 --> 00:35:17.870
isn't stable enough to withstand
an inconsistent liver transplant, and...

381
00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:23.611
you have a high liver somatic index,
so you can't donate yours.

382
00:35:27.350 --> 00:35:32.185
Does your wife have a brother
or sister who can donate

383
00:35:32.185 --> 00:35:34.885
- his or her liver?
- She's an only child.

384
00:35:37.218 --> 00:35:39.106
What about her parents?

385
00:35:40.531 --> 00:35:43.390
My mother-in-law passed away...

386
00:35:43.392 --> 00:35:46.374
and my father-in-law is alive, but...

387
00:35:46.374 --> 00:35:51.200
Baek Gyu Sang, who is currently
confined at Shingwang Prison...

388
00:35:52.053 --> 00:35:53.749
How did you know that?

389
00:35:53.749 --> 00:35:57.919
You're saying that your wife doesn't have
any family besides Baek Gyu Sang, right?

390
00:35:58.885 --> 00:36:00.374
Yes.

391
00:36:03.941 --> 00:36:06.140
Did you look into
Baek Gyung Seo's family?

392
00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:09.539
<i>Yes, she does have family, but...</i>

393
00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:13.550
It's fulminant hepatic failure.
(Acute liver failure.)

394
00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:16.060
Hurry and find a family member
who can do a raw liver transplant.

395
00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:17.560
Okay, I'll do that.

396
00:36:24.899 --> 00:36:28.388
<i>This is Doctor
Kang In Kyu's phone, right?</i>

397
00:36:28.888 --> 00:36:30.689
Yes, it is.

398
00:36:31.850 --> 00:36:34.050
This is Go Ji In from Sunrim Hospital.

399
00:36:35.271 --> 00:36:38.245
- What's this about?
<i>- Didn't I ask you that?</i>

400
00:36:38.245 --> 00:36:42.149
I asked, what if Baek Gyu Sang is the
only one who can do the liver transplant?

401
00:36:42.832 --> 00:36:44.031
So?

402
00:36:44.031 --> 00:36:46.852
<i>Wait, what kind of question is that?</i>

403
00:36:46.852 --> 00:36:49.118
Baek Gyung Seo
has fulminant hepatic failure

404
00:36:49.118 --> 00:36:52.162
<i>and Baek Gyu Sang is the only one
who can do the transplant.</i>

405
00:36:53.149 --> 00:36:54.774
<i>Hello, are you listening?</i>

406
00:36:55.399 --> 00:36:56.812
He...

407
00:36:57.943 --> 00:36:58.943
Wow.

408
00:37:04.477 --> 00:37:07.377
What is the organ donation
procedure for prisoners?

409
00:37:10.149 --> 00:37:13.050
What are you asking all of a sudden?

410
00:37:13.050 --> 00:37:16.852
Prisoner Baek Gyu Sang's daughter
got into a car accident on the way there.

411
00:37:16.852 --> 00:37:18.332
<i>So?</i>

412
00:37:18.332 --> 00:37:20.383
She needs a liver transplant right away.

413
00:37:20.383 --> 00:37:22.785
I'm pretty sure I already told you this.

414
00:37:22.785 --> 00:37:26.713
In this place, pretend that
you don't see or know anything

415
00:37:26.713 --> 00:37:28.756
and act like you're a dead rat.

416
00:37:28.756 --> 00:37:32.207
Baek Gyu Sang is the only one
who can do the transplant.

417
00:37:33.441 --> 00:37:37.060
That's not under
our jurisdiction. Our duties

418
00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:40.325
only pertain to the confined prisoners.

419
00:37:40.325 --> 00:37:42.140
If...

420
00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:46.240
this was about your son,
would you say the same thing?

421
00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:56.689
That would never happen
to my son. I'm hanging up.

422
00:37:59.156 --> 00:38:01.955
Is... is something the matter?

423
00:38:02.859 --> 00:38:04.660
No, it's nothing.

424
00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:07.359
Don't forget to take your medicine, okay?

425
00:38:07.359 --> 00:38:11.687
And be careful of candies
and chocolates at all times.

426
00:38:11.687 --> 00:38:14.046
Those things are like
poison to your body.

427
00:38:14.046 --> 00:38:15.546
Okay.

428
00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:22.390
- Is his treatment over?
- Yes.

429
00:38:32.841 --> 00:38:35.260
You pay six 10-minute visits a week

430
00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:38.350
to your son, under the guise
of giving him treatment.

431
00:38:38.350 --> 00:38:39.550
Geez.

432
00:38:41.872 --> 00:38:46.272
Do you think you'd be able
to stay here if the truth got out?

433
00:38:51.249 --> 00:38:54.149
<i>I didn't come here to kill Kim Hyung Bum.</i>

434
00:38:54.899 --> 00:38:56.800
<i>I came here to save him.</i>

435
00:39:02.899 --> 00:39:04.499
<i>Yes, Chief Baek?</i>

436
00:39:04.999 --> 00:39:09.780
Please call Prisoner 4713,
Kim Hyung Bum, to my office.

437
00:39:17.921 --> 00:39:21.020
- Please take me to Shingwang Prison.
- Sure.

438
00:39:43.399 --> 00:39:45.935
This was Doctor Kang's request.

439
00:39:48.649 --> 00:39:51.620
He asked me to measure
your liver somatic index.

440
00:39:54.386 --> 00:39:58.027
In the last few days, did you
experience any appetite loss

441
00:39:58.027 --> 00:40:02.734
a pain in the upper-right
part of your stomach

442
00:40:02.734 --> 00:40:06.884
or any nausea or itchiness?

443
00:40:08.399 --> 00:40:12.518
Doctor Kang has great interest...

444
00:40:14.341 --> 00:40:15.904
in you.

445
00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:25.676
He frequently looks at your
medical charts during his breaks too.

446
00:40:26.511 --> 00:40:31.783
And it seems like he's been
going through your case files...

447
00:40:32.359 --> 00:40:34.723
Doctor Kang didn't
ask you to do this, did he?

448
00:40:35.426 --> 00:40:38.725
Don't you think there's
a reason why Doctor Kang

449
00:40:38.727 --> 00:40:41.426
is so interested in you?

450
00:40:43.455 --> 00:40:46.192
You're pretty interested too.

451
00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:49.602
Am I wrong?

452
00:41:16.350 --> 00:41:19.200
What are you doing here
during your time off?

453
00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:21.937
Why did Prisoner Kim Hyung Bum
just come out of here?

454
00:41:21.937 --> 00:41:24.955
Is it strange for a doctor
to see a patient?

455
00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:28.468
It's weirder that you're
getting mad all of a sudden.

456
00:41:31.299 --> 00:41:35.323
He said the pit of his stomach hurt,
so I prescribed him some medicine.

457
00:41:37.850 --> 00:41:40.189
The same way you've been doing it.

458
00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:50.100
4713, why aren't you
taking your medicine?

459
00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:16.587
Did you ask Baek Gyu Sang?

460
00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:19.799
I'm pretty sure I already
told you that it's not possible.

461
00:42:19.799 --> 00:42:22.091
Then why don't you tell me
why it's not possible?

462
00:42:22.091 --> 00:42:24.283
It's not under our jurisdiction.

463
00:42:26.399 --> 00:42:29.799
If Baek Gyu Sang's daughter
doesn't get a transplant, she'll die.

464
00:42:29.799 --> 00:42:32.000
She's in a very urgent situation!

465
00:42:34.388 --> 00:42:37.288
Geez, you sure are
an entertaining person.

466
00:42:37.288 --> 00:42:39.533
Doctor Kang, why did you become a doctor?

467
00:42:39.533 --> 00:42:44.102
Wasn't it to get revenge?
You came here to get your revenge.

468
00:42:44.102 --> 00:42:46.964
Then stay consistent!

469
00:42:46.964 --> 00:42:51.335
Get your revenge or quit altogether.

470
00:42:51.335 --> 00:42:54.285
If you keep acting
like that, you'll confuse me.

471
00:42:54.285 --> 00:42:56.435
Because you look like a good doctor.

472
00:42:56.435 --> 00:42:59.685
Kim Hyung Bum killed a man!

473
00:42:59.685 --> 00:43:01.330
Baek Gyu Sang is a criminal too.

474
00:43:01.330 --> 00:43:04.297
But Baek Gyu Sang's
daughter did nothing wrong.

475
00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:09.801
Is there a single person in this world
who hasn't done something wrong?

476
00:43:13.864 --> 00:43:15.790
She's a mother of two children.

477
00:43:15.790 --> 00:43:19.239
If we leave her that way, her children
will grow up without a mother.

478
00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:22.341
Chief Baek, you know what that's like.

479
00:43:22.899 --> 00:43:26.205
You know how it feels to see
a child grow up without a mother.

480
00:43:26.205 --> 00:43:29.790
And how hard it is for a man
to raise a child by himself.

481
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.214
- Wow, good job!
- Good job!

482
00:43:35.214 --> 00:43:37.919
- Good job!
- Do a good job!

483
00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:47.408
You need to protect your son.

484
00:43:53.899 --> 00:43:57.768
It must follow a specific process.

485
00:43:58.335 --> 00:44:02.384
A request for the prisoner's transfer
to the hospital, a doctor's diagnosis

486
00:44:02.386 --> 00:44:06.185
a request for a stay of execution,
and screening by the Ministry of Justice.

487
00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:09.700
We need to complete
all those steps to let him out.

488
00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:11.942
We'll have to hurry.

489
00:44:11.942 --> 00:44:14.681
Before the people at the
Ministry of Justice go home.

490
00:44:16.299 --> 00:44:18.299
Is a diagnosis all we need?

491
00:44:19.484 --> 00:44:22.426
We also need an opinion letter
from the doctor in charge.

492
00:45:11.562 --> 00:45:13.161
Hello?

493
00:45:19.330 --> 00:45:21.044
Talk to me.

494
00:45:22.937 --> 00:45:26.303
- It's me.
- Kang In Kyu?

495
00:45:27.850 --> 00:45:32.602
Please send me Baek Gyung Seo's
diagnosis and opinion letter by fax.

496
00:45:32.602 --> 00:45:35.473
- What for?
- The donor is confined in prison

497
00:45:35.473 --> 00:45:38.652
so I need it to apply
for a stay of execution.

498
00:45:39.547 --> 00:45:41.547
Okay, I'll send it to you right away.

499
00:45:48.857 --> 00:45:50.946
<i>[Save Under New Name]</i>

500
00:45:50.946 --> 00:45:54.245
<i>[Son]</i>

501
00:45:56.194 --> 00:45:58.614
Good thing I didn't change my number.

00:45:59.424 --> 00:46:02.080

505
00:46:38.549 --> 00:46:40.870
Thank you, Doctor Kang.

506
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.683
I heard from one of the prison officers.

507
00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:48.359
That you made a lot of effort.

508
00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:57.676
What would you have done if I
refused to donate my liver?

509
00:46:58.899 --> 00:47:00.899
I knew you'd do it.

510
00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:04.105
Because you're a father.

511
00:47:04.736 --> 00:47:07.294
A father who'd do anything for his child.

512
00:47:12.835 --> 00:47:16.419
<i>If I donate my kidney</i>

513
00:47:16.421 --> 00:47:20.725
can I really donate my liver
to my daughter without any problems?

514
00:47:20.725 --> 00:47:24.239
Yes, I got it. Yes.

515
00:47:24.239 --> 00:47:27.788
Then... have a good day. Bye.

516
00:47:28.799 --> 00:47:31.100
<i>[We buy kidneys.]</i>

517
00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:38.667
- Dad!
- Are you happy?

518
00:47:38.667 --> 00:47:42.567
Of course! I wanted these so badly!

519
00:47:44.924 --> 00:47:49.627
If you take care of In Joo for me,
I'll buy you a nicer pair later.

520
00:47:49.627 --> 00:47:52.864
- Really?
- Really.

521
00:47:57.799 --> 00:48:00.411
Geez, you little punk.

522
00:48:00.411 --> 00:48:02.160
Wow.

523
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.200
Don't worry.

524
00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:48.431
It'll all turn out well.

525
00:48:53.515 --> 00:48:55.254
Thank you.

526
00:49:01.421 --> 00:49:02.863
Hello?

527
00:49:04.138 --> 00:49:07.038
Right now? Okay.

528
00:49:07.596 --> 00:49:09.806
- Coordinator Go.
- Yes?

529
00:49:09.806 --> 00:49:13.381
Go downstairs. Patient Baek Gyung Seo's
donor just passed through the gate.

530
00:49:13.381 --> 00:49:17.277
- Patient Baek Gyung Seo's donor?
- That's right.

531
00:49:45.707 --> 00:49:49.332
I really don't like you...

532
00:49:49.332 --> 00:49:53.335
but thank you for your hard work.
I'm thankful for your efforts.

533
00:49:56.450 --> 00:49:58.611
You never change, do you?

534
00:49:59.776 --> 00:50:01.495
Right this way.

535
00:50:19.312 --> 00:50:21.915
Okay, Grandpa...

536
00:50:22.991 --> 00:50:24.341
it's this left part.

537
00:50:24.341 --> 00:50:28.728
So we'll take the left part of your liver
and give it to your daughter.

538
00:50:28.728 --> 00:50:30.279
But...

539
00:50:30.279 --> 00:50:33.940
if we're going to do this anyway,
can't I give her this big part instead?

540
00:50:33.940 --> 00:50:36.640
I don't care what happens to me.

541
00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:39.707
I've already lived a long time anyway.

542
00:50:39.707 --> 00:50:43.785
I understand that you want to do
everything you can for your daughter.

543
00:50:43.785 --> 00:50:47.033
But, in raw transplants,
it's also important for the donor

544
00:50:47.033 --> 00:50:50.736
to live a healthy life after the surgery

545
00:50:50.736 --> 00:50:53.781
so we're only going
to take what's necessary.

546
00:50:54.299 --> 00:50:56.257
Don't worry too much.

547
00:50:56.257 --> 00:51:01.198
Both of your livers will grow back
to their usual sizes in half a year.

548
00:51:01.198 --> 00:51:03.924
Then you'll both be able
to go back to your normal lives.

549
00:51:03.924 --> 00:51:08.493
Then, you're saying that
my daughter will be able to live, right?

550
00:51:08.493 --> 00:51:10.504
Yes, of course.

551
00:51:16.328 --> 00:51:20.234
Why are you bawling your eyes out?
It's not like he died.

552
00:51:26.219 --> 00:51:29.053
- In Sung.
- What?

553
00:51:29.053 --> 00:51:34.236
Please give your father
a part of your liver.

554
00:51:34.969 --> 00:51:36.969
What's wrong with you? Are you crazy?

555
00:51:36.969 --> 00:51:39.893
If you don't, you'll father will...

556
00:51:42.477 --> 00:51:44.710
die.

557
00:51:48.553 --> 00:51:51.642
Buy one then. You have a lot of money.

558
00:51:52.377 --> 00:51:56.430
You're the only one
who can do it right now.

559
00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:58.774
Don't you remember what you told me?

560
00:51:58.774 --> 00:52:02.033
You told me not to worry, and that
you'd take care of everything!

561
00:52:03.303 --> 00:52:05.430
In Sung.

562
00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:10.649
I won't do it.
No, I can't do it, no matter what.

563
00:52:14.955 --> 00:52:17.395
Why are you doing this to me?

564
00:52:24.732 --> 00:52:29.317
Oh, my, so you're that Grandpa's
granddaughter? Handshake.

565
00:52:29.817 --> 00:52:32.848
Gosh, you're a shy one.

566
00:52:32.848 --> 00:52:35.312
But why are you out here?

567
00:52:35.312 --> 00:52:39.411
They said that we're allowed
to visit him, but Father-in-law refused.

568
00:52:39.411 --> 00:52:41.928
Oh, really?

569
00:52:41.928 --> 00:52:43.180
Yes.

570
00:52:57.750 --> 00:53:01.393
Grandpa, your granddaughter
and son-in-law are waiting outside.

571
00:53:01.393 --> 00:53:03.129
I know.

572
00:53:03.866 --> 00:53:07.805
What is it? I thought
you wanted to see her.

573
00:53:07.805 --> 00:53:10.806
This will be her first time
seeing her grandfather...

574
00:53:14.107 --> 00:53:16.991
How can I see her when I'm in this state?

575
00:53:42.767 --> 00:53:44.522
Who's that?

576
00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:46.700
Your grandpa.

577
00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:49.643
Byul.

578
00:53:51.203 --> 00:53:53.040
Come here.

579
00:53:55.109 --> 00:53:57.285
Come to your grandpa.

580
00:54:00.754 --> 00:54:03.453
Is he my grandpa?

581
00:54:03.453 --> 00:54:04.873
Yeah.

582
00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:10.632
Give him a hug.

583
00:54:20.450 --> 00:54:22.661
Geez, my baby.

584
00:54:24.299 --> 00:54:26.772
Geez, my baby.

585
00:54:33.029 --> 00:54:34.667
Byul.

586
00:54:35.850 --> 00:54:37.564
Our Byul.

587
00:55:03.006 --> 00:55:04.660
I'm sorry.

588
00:55:41.776 --> 00:55:45.964
<i>In the last few days, did you
experience a loss in appetite...</i>

589
00:55:45.964 --> 00:55:50.964
a pain in the upper-right
part of your stomach

590
00:55:51.466 --> 00:55:55.078
<i>or any nausea or itchiness?</i>

591
00:56:04.149 --> 00:56:07.149
- A warm Amercano, please.
- Sure.

592
00:56:24.517 --> 00:56:26.459
We meet again.

593
00:56:28.142 --> 00:56:29.765
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

594
00:56:29.765 --> 00:56:31.893
A warm Americano, please.

595
00:56:31.893 --> 00:56:32.993
Sure.

596
00:56:33.799 --> 00:56:36.180
What brings you to our hospital
first thing in the morning?

597
00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:38.680
- A prisoner is hospitalized here.
- Oh, I see.

598
00:56:44.603 --> 00:56:47.904
- Your coffee's ready.
- Oh, thank you.

599
00:56:49.018 --> 00:56:50.410
I'll see you later.

600
00:56:51.993 --> 00:56:54.993
Aren't you curious...

601
00:56:54.993 --> 00:56:57.768
about the pregnant TA patient's baby?

602
00:57:08.700 --> 00:57:10.404
Isn't she beautiful?

603
00:57:13.027 --> 00:57:15.328
Apparently, her nickname is Sky.

604
00:57:15.328 --> 00:57:18.812
In hopes that she'll embrace
the world, as if she were a sky.

605
00:57:21.799 --> 00:57:25.589
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't
have been able to get her out.

606
00:57:25.589 --> 00:57:27.745
I wouldn't have had the courage.

607
00:57:31.830 --> 00:57:33.480
Thank you.

608
00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:36.087
I'm ER specialist, Son Yeon Hee.

609
00:57:38.127 --> 00:57:39.977
I'm Kang In Kyu.

610
00:57:51.098 --> 00:57:52.098
Yes?

611
00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:55.018
Doctor Kang, where are you?

612
00:57:55.018 --> 00:57:56.892
I'm at Sunrim Hospital.

613
00:57:56.892 --> 00:57:59.323
Hurry over to the conference room then.

614
00:57:59.323 --> 00:58:02.538
- What's the matter?
<i>- It's the center chief's orders.</i>

615
00:58:02.538 --> 00:58:05.364
<i>It seems like Baek Gyu Sang
was mistaken about his blood type.</i>

616
00:58:05.364 --> 00:58:09.218
He wrote down B as his blood type,
but the test says that he's an A.

617
00:58:09.218 --> 00:58:12.442
- What did you say?
<i>- It's a common mistake among elders.</i>

618
00:58:12.442 --> 00:58:14.477
They're often mistaken
about their blood types.

619
00:58:14.477 --> 00:58:17.093
Okay, I got it.
I'll head over right away.

620
00:58:25.799 --> 00:58:27.100
Take a seat.

621
00:58:36.399 --> 00:58:38.705
As you all know...

622
00:58:38.705 --> 00:58:42.060
Baek Gyu Sang and
Baek Gyung Seo's liver transplant

623
00:58:42.060 --> 00:58:43.897
fell through.

624
00:58:43.897 --> 00:58:45.995
Is an inconsistent liver
transplant not possible?

625
00:58:45.995 --> 00:58:48.296
It's impossible,
with Baek Gyung Seo's condition.

626
00:58:48.296 --> 00:58:51.609
Then, are you suggesting that we wait
until she's chosen from the waiting list

627
00:58:51.609 --> 00:58:53.408
when she's in such critical condition?

628
00:58:53.410 --> 00:58:56.113
No, we have to find one.

629
00:58:56.113 --> 00:58:57.870
How?

630
00:59:00.350 --> 00:59:02.149
A donor exchange transplant.

631
00:59:09.609 --> 00:59:14.022
A donor exchange transplant is impossible
with our hospital's current manpower.

632
00:59:14.022 --> 00:59:15.428
No, it's possible.

633
00:59:15.428 --> 00:59:17.448
In order to operate
on four patients at once

634
00:59:17.448 --> 00:59:20.611
we need two surgeons for the extractions
and two surgeons for the transplants.

635
00:59:20.611 --> 00:59:24.524
We currently have Doctor Lee,
Doctor Hong, and myself.

636
00:59:24.524 --> 00:59:28.390
And we can bring another doctor
on board to fill the last spot.

637
00:59:28.906 --> 00:59:30.573
Who...

638
00:59:34.937 --> 00:59:36.457
It's not...

639
00:59:38.017 --> 00:59:39.852
Doctor Kang In Kyu.

640
00:59:46.167 --> 00:59:48.109
I'll decline.

641
01:00:12.134 --> 01:00:15.056
<i>[Cross]</i>

642
01:00:15.056 --> 01:00:18.301
<i>- Hurry!
- You might like Doctor Kang now</i>

643
01:00:18.301 --> 01:00:20.069
<i>but who knows when he'll suddenly change?</i>

644
01:00:20.069 --> 01:00:23.308
<i>Isn't your father around?</i>

645
01:00:25.256 --> 01:00:29.189
<i>- I think he's a real doctor.
- Isn't it too soon?</i>

646
01:00:29.189 --> 01:00:30.973
<i>Do you want me to
introduce you to a part-time job?</i>

647
01:00:30.973 --> 01:00:36.216
<i>If you do it just once, you'll make
enough money to last you a lifetime.</i>

648
01:00:36.216 --> 01:00:38.966
<i>- Can I give you something nice?
- Pardon?</i>

649
01:00:38.966 --> 01:00:43.330
<i>I'm a doctor at Shingwang Prison,
not Sunrim Hospital.</i>

650
01:00:43.899 --> 01:00:48.149
<i>Can't you operate on my
daughter, Doctor Kang?</i>

651
01:00:49.267 --> 01:00:51.908
<i>We don't have a choice in this situation.</i>

652
01:00:52.408 --> 01:00:54.413
<i>- It's past the surgery time.
- If not, we have to cancel it.</i>

653
01:00:54.413 --> 01:00:57.136
<i>- There's still time.
- In Joo!</i>

654
01:01:03.131 --> 01:01:04.950
<i>This is all your fault.</i>

655
01:01:06.700 --> 01:01:11.700
