<i>News Nine exclusive interview
with Kevin Lee.</i>

7
00:00:19.888 --> 00:00:20.911
Will that do?

<i>How could you lie like that?
Kevin Lee?</i>

<i>- Hye Ran.
- I have go get a guest for my show.</i>

11

My mom won't live
just because I'm there.

12
00:00:29.161 --> 00:00:31.542
How low will you go?
How low are you going to go?

<i>I love you, Hye Ran.</i>

<i>Hello, I'm Eun Joo's husband, Kevin.</i>

15
00:00:51.363 --> 00:00:54.775
She's definitely 10 times
prettier in real life.

16
00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:59.674
Do you suppose I could get
a copy of this recording?

17
00:00:59.674 --> 00:01:01.515
Try it if you want to get fired.

18
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:03.287
Ah...

00:01:04.223 --> 00:01:05.580
<i>Go Hye Ran?</i>

20
00:01:11.527 --> 00:01:13.991
When did you find out they were married?

21
00:01:17.462 --> 00:01:19.334
I found out while doing my story.

22
00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.092
Seo Eun Joo was your high school
classmate and you didn't know?

23
00:01:23.092 --> 00:01:25.358
I never saw her after
we graduated from high school.

24
00:01:25.358 --> 00:01:26.556
What about Kevin Lee?

25
00:01:31.806 --> 00:01:36.021
Since you are a precise person with
a good memory, I'll ask you again.

26
00:01:38.363 --> 00:01:40.622
Did you ever meet with Kevin Lee...

27
00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:43.762
before that time?

28
00:01:51.306 --> 00:01:53.941
<i>I love you, Hye Ran.</i>

29
00:02:33.411 --> 00:02:34.558
Let's talk.

30
00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:37.927
I'm done talking.

31
00:02:38.308 --> 00:02:39.569
Let me ask you one thing.

32
00:02:40.677 --> 00:02:44.676
Because I'm a guy without
much to offer and no prospects

33
00:02:44.676 --> 00:02:46.872
is that why you're doing this?

34
00:02:48.707 --> 00:02:49.755
Yes.

35
00:03:00.541 --> 00:03:01.659
Lee Jae Young.

36
00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.189
I've thrown you away.

37
00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:07.141
You should throw me away too.

38
00:03:07.678 --> 00:03:10.819
Just call me an awful woman
and tell me to live my life.

39
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.731
That's what I'm going to do.

40
00:03:15.081 --> 00:03:16.428
Once you throw me away...

41
00:03:18.018 --> 00:03:19.849
how well do you think you can live?

42
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.773
Better than being with you.

43
00:03:29.116 --> 00:03:30.267
All right. Leave.

44
00:03:31.046 --> 00:03:32.945
But, I'll be watching over you.

45
00:03:33.505 --> 00:03:35.290
I'll see just how well you live.

46
00:03:35.675 --> 00:03:37.814
I'll watch over you
to see how far you get.

47
00:03:39.231 --> 00:03:40.505
So...

48
00:03:42.045 --> 00:03:43.433
you'd better live well.

49
00:03:44.374 --> 00:03:45.404
All right.

50
00:03:47.463 --> 00:03:48.720
I will.

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:09.992
<i>Jae Young.</i>

54
00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:12.588
Honey.

55
00:04:15.511 --> 00:04:17.112
Is this someone you know?

56
00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.900
No, I ran into her and she fell.

57
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:22.941
Oh my.

58
00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:27.617
It's you, right?

59
00:04:27.929 --> 00:04:30.126
Hye Ran. Go Hye Ran!

60
00:04:41.766 --> 00:04:43.263
Senior, why aren't you picking up?

61
00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:44.968
Have you arrived?

62
00:04:45.316 --> 00:04:47.008
Where are you right now?

63
00:04:50.975 --> 00:04:52.684
Seo Eun Joo?

64
00:04:52.684 --> 00:04:54.807
Yes! It's me.

65
00:04:54.807 --> 00:04:56.787
It's so great to see you!

66
00:04:57.706 --> 00:05:00.886
Honey, I always mention it
when we watch the news.

67
00:05:00.886 --> 00:05:04.066
The really famous anchor
in Korea is my friend.

68
00:05:04.066 --> 00:05:06.698
How is it possible to meet like this?

69
00:05:06.698 --> 00:05:09.167
You look prettier in real life.

70
00:05:09.167 --> 00:05:11.388
I've heard a lot about you.

71
00:05:11.388 --> 00:05:13.811
I'm Eun Joo's husband, Kevin Lee.

72
00:05:13.811 --> 00:05:17.552
Oh, you'd be more comfortable
with my Korean name.

73
00:05:17.552 --> 00:05:19.537
My name is Lee Jae Young.

74
00:05:26.465 --> 00:05:29.302
Kev... Kevin Lee?

75
00:05:32.573 --> 00:05:35.544
Do you like golf, by any chance?

76
00:05:36.352 --> 00:05:41.643
He's the Kevin Lee
who just won the PGA.

77
00:05:41.643 --> 00:05:43.203
My husband.

78
00:05:44.446 --> 00:05:47.158
He was on the news too.

79
00:05:47.158 --> 00:05:48.860
He just recently...

<i>[Episode 2: Provoke]</i>

81
00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:25.650
How did this happen?
It's amazing really.

82
00:06:28.374 --> 00:06:30.504
We hung out together often.

83
00:06:30.504 --> 00:06:32.605
She was a really good friend.

84
00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:37.477
How could we meet in a place like this?

85
00:06:54.054 --> 00:06:55.816
What does your husband do?

86
00:06:59.432 --> 00:07:01.511
Hye Ran?

87
00:07:01.511 --> 00:07:04.453
- Huh?
- I asked what your husband does.

88
00:07:05.634 --> 00:07:06.703
Oh.

89
00:07:08.412 --> 00:07:10.376
He was a prosecutor
and now he's a lawyer.

90
00:07:11.263 --> 00:07:12.687
A lawyer.

91
00:07:13.554 --> 00:07:16.999
My in-law's family was in
the supreme court for generations.

92
00:07:16.999 --> 00:07:19.174
Oh, you smart girl.

93
00:07:19.174 --> 00:07:22.345
I knew you would marry well like that.

94
00:07:22.345 --> 00:07:25.645
But, isn't it hard being
married into a family like that?

95
00:07:25.645 --> 00:07:28.355
Your in-laws don't harass you
or anything like that?

96
00:07:29.787 --> 00:07:31.884
No, they don't.

97
00:07:31.884 --> 00:07:33.953
They're very dignified people.

98
00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:35.364
They care about me a lot.

99
00:07:36.235 --> 00:07:38.624
How nice for you.

100
00:07:38.624 --> 00:07:41.775
Oh yeah. When can I meet your husband?

101
00:07:42.835 --> 00:07:46.376
The four of us should meet
as couples and have dinner.

102
00:07:46.376 --> 00:07:48.917
Huh?

103
00:07:48.917 --> 00:07:50.009
Sure.

104
00:07:51.035 --> 00:07:52.249
Why not.

105
00:08:09.687 --> 00:08:11.821
Please accept my condolences
for your loss.

106
00:08:11.821 --> 00:08:13.631
Thank you for coming.

107
00:08:28.244 --> 00:08:29.456
That scary girl.

108
00:08:29.456 --> 00:08:31.994
- She's not even crying?
- What?

109
00:08:31.994 --> 00:08:34.703
She seems fine
even though her mom died.

110
00:08:34.703 --> 00:08:37.444
I know. She scares me a bit.

111
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.516
She sure made herself pale and pretty.

112
00:08:42.516 --> 00:08:43.963
What color is that makeup?

113
00:08:43.963 --> 00:08:47.597
She probably took care to match
the funeral concept.

114
00:08:47.597 --> 00:08:48.798
There are people watching.

115
00:08:48.798 --> 00:08:50.857
Maybe she went to a salon
for her hair and makeup.

116
00:08:50.857 --> 00:08:52.732
I doubt that, Yeon Jung.

117
00:08:52.732 --> 00:08:53.977

The internet is exploding with comments.

128
00:09:43.665 --> 00:09:46.649
Real time ratings are very high too.

129
00:09:46.649 --> 00:09:51.520
It is also affecting chances for
the minority party's leader next month.

She has a lot of energy, doesn't she?

140
00:11:28.053 --> 00:11:30.223
She isn't shaken even though
she's the replacement.

141
00:11:30.223 --> 00:11:31.660
- She's doing well.
- Right?

142
00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:34.650
She's got a lot of talent.

143
00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:39.309
It's not a bad idea to warm up like this.

She was your mom.

153
00:12:30.934 --> 00:12:32.655
The only mom you have.

154
00:12:33.732 --> 00:12:37.530
You don't need to care
what people think or hold it in.

155
00:12:38.775 --> 00:12:40.886
That's how you should send her off.

156
00:12:47.817 --> 00:12:51.574
Your shirt is very wrinkled.

157
00:12:56.795 --> 00:12:58.953
Go and get changed.

158
00:12:58.953 --> 00:13:02.136
They're mourning clothes,

00:13:03.136 --> 00:13:06.074
Your tie is black,
so your handkerchief should be gray.

00:13:06.074 --> 00:13:07.750
- Go Hye Ran.
- Why should I cry?

162
00:13:08.876 --> 00:13:10.857
What would change if I cried?

163
00:13:12.872 --> 00:13:16.954
Director Jang will bring the team.
I'll officially introduce you then.

164

I'll mention that your family has been

Oh, don't forget to mention that
you're a former prosecutor.

They may mistakenly think you're
a public defender due to lack of skill.

168

Make sure you have a clean shave.

You have a lot of vacation days left.

Yes, President.

Are you going to be this way?

I asked you to share
information on Kevin Lee.

235
00:20:22.932 --> 00:20:25.711
You only help Hye Ran
and your colleague is nothing?

236
00:20:25.711 --> 00:20:28.789
- That's not it.
- Are you taking her side?

237
00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:32.105
Or is she hitting on you too?
She wants you on her side?

238
00:20:32.105 --> 00:20:33.773
Don't be ridiculous.

239
00:20:33.773 --> 00:20:36.577
- Hye Ran is not like that.
- Then what?

240
00:20:36.577 --> 00:20:39.396
Yes, I told her that he
was back in Korea.

241
00:20:39.396 --> 00:20:41.465
But, I lost him at the airport.

242
00:20:43.235 --> 00:20:44.376
Is that right?

243
00:20:44.376 --> 00:20:47.695
You lost him, yet he's here right now?

244
00:20:47.695 --> 00:20:49.867
- How?
- I don't know that.

245
00:20:49.867 --> 00:20:53.715
You really don't know?

246
00:20:59.091 --> 00:21:01.085
Eun Joo, I brought the questions...

247
00:21:12.859 --> 00:21:15.148
Did Eun Joo go somewhere?

248
00:21:15.148 --> 00:21:16.960
To the car to get something for me.

249
00:21:19.148 --> 00:21:20.578
Can you close that?

250
00:21:22.133 --> 00:21:23.543
Ah, yes.

251
00:22:05.316 --> 00:22:07.754
I brought the questions I'll be asking.

252
00:22:07.754 --> 00:22:09.882
These are the general questions
I'll be asking.

253
00:22:09.882 --> 00:22:13.648
You'll know once you see,
but none of them are too difficult.

254
00:22:13.648 --> 00:22:16.118
You can speak naturally,
like you're having a conversation.

255
00:22:16.118 --> 00:22:17.838
You can look at me while you speak.

256
00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:33.962
Like this?

257
00:22:53.729 --> 00:22:55.638
Is this good enough?

258
00:23:14.447 --> 00:23:17.193
Please check the questions.

259
00:23:17.193 --> 00:23:20.080
Don't create a broadcast issue
with an irrelevant answer.

260
00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:22.500
Broadcasting is not a joke,
Lee Jae Young.

261
00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:28.648
I'm not here to joke around.

262
00:23:42.306 --> 00:23:45.029
Oh, you're here.

263
00:23:45.029 --> 00:23:46.264
Where were you?

264
00:23:47.279 --> 00:23:50.822
It's not like I'm going on TV,
but I must be nervous.

265
00:23:50.822 --> 00:23:52.953
I left the tie in the car.

266
00:23:54.425 --> 00:23:58.288
I brought the questions.
It helps to read them in advance.

267
00:23:58.288 --> 00:23:59.761
Oh, I see.

268
00:23:59.761 --> 00:24:02.183
I appreciate the explanation, Go Hye Ran.

269
00:24:02.183 --> 00:24:05.382
Yes, I'll see you later.

270
00:24:05.382 --> 00:24:06.413
All right.

271
00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:14.973
How could you be in
this state in front of my friend?

272
00:24:14.973 --> 00:24:16.261
You are so silly.

273
00:24:16.261 --> 00:24:18.125
What's the big deal?

274
00:24:18.125 --> 00:24:21.537
Do you have the questions?
Did you read over them?

275
00:24:21.537 --> 00:24:24.886
If you don't want to answer
any of them, tell Hye Ran.

276
00:24:24.886 --> 00:24:27.848
Hye Ran will skip over them.

277
00:24:27.848 --> 00:24:29.485
All right?

278
00:24:29.485 --> 00:24:32.028
- Are you that happy?
- Yes.

279

Every single day,
I'm so happy.

281

I'll make sure you live that way

She did use her last card.

326
00:27:58.946 --> 00:28:01.135
She should be nervous.

327
00:28:01.135 --> 00:28:02.386
What do you mean?

328
00:28:03.746 --> 00:28:05.636
Oh, it's just something.

329
00:28:05.636 --> 00:28:07.088
Five seconds left in the intro.

330
00:28:07.088 --> 00:28:09.832
Four, three, two, one.

331
00:28:09.832 --> 00:28:12.136
Camera three, standby. Cue!

332
00:28:13.144 --> 00:28:15.421
<i>News, that runs on its feet.
Fast news.</i>

333
00:28:15.421 --> 00:28:16.944
Go Hye Ran's News Nine.

334
00:28:16.944 --> 00:28:18.433
As promised

335
00:28:18.433 --> 00:28:22.175
we have Korea's Kevin Lee,
who has made golf history.

336
00:28:22.175 --> 00:28:24.555
He is in the studio with us today.

337
00:28:24.555 --> 00:28:27.933
- It's nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you.

338
00:28:27.933 --> 00:28:31.524
It was the US Open last June
and this time the PGA Tour.

339
00:28:31.524 --> 00:28:33.494
You have won once again.

340
00:28:33.494 --> 00:28:36.495
It's a little late,
but tell us how you feel.

341
00:28:42.493 --> 00:28:43.637
Did you enjoy seeing it?

342
00:28:45.206 --> 00:28:46.288
That's who I am.

343
00:28:51.509 --> 00:28:52.587
Pardon me?

344
00:28:54.132 --> 00:28:55.403
<i>Let me ask you one thing.</i>

345
00:28:56.322 --> 00:29:00.162
Because I'm a guy without
much to offer and no prospects

346
00:29:00.162 --> 00:29:02.643
is that why you're doing this?

347
00:29:02.643 --> 00:29:04.317
Yes.

348
00:29:04.317 --> 00:29:05.338
What do you think?

349
00:29:06.637 --> 00:29:08.778
Am I still a guy with no prospects?

350
00:29:34.799 --> 00:29:36.858
What are you referring to?

351
00:29:42.445 --> 00:29:45.951
That's what I want to say to those
who looked down on me all this time.

352
00:29:50.825 --> 00:29:55.315
It seems you suffered a lot.

353
00:29:57.181 --> 00:30:00.780
People looked down on me
and turned their backs on me.

354
00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:03.300
I was told I was a person
with no prospects.

355
00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:04.471
That's how it was.

356
00:30:08.501 --> 00:30:10.376
To those people

357
00:30:10.376 --> 00:30:14.847
you have shown who you
really are with these victories.

358
00:30:17.088 --> 00:30:19.338
It seemed they were shocked to see me.

359
00:30:20.377 --> 00:30:22.157
More than I imagined.

360
00:30:27.435 --> 00:30:31.232
Others have difficulty winning
even once in their life.

361
00:30:31.232 --> 00:30:33.809
You now have won twice.

362
00:30:33.809 --> 00:30:37.213
I'm curious about
your next goal, Kevin Lee.

363
00:30:37.213 --> 00:30:38.492
You, Go Hye Ran.

364
00:30:49.442 --> 00:30:52.945
I want to become the best
at what I do, just like you.

365
00:30:52.945 --> 00:30:55.838
That is my final goal and
I know it will happen.

366
00:31:03.145 --> 00:31:07.944
<i>No one in Korea believed in my talent.</i>

367
00:31:07.944 --> 00:31:10.524
<i>I think people view things differently.</i>

368
00:31:10.524 --> 00:31:13.244
<i>They cared about what I had
and my outer appearance.</i>

369
00:31:13.244 --> 00:31:16.827
<i>People only judged me
by those kinds of things.</i>

370
00:31:17.961 --> 00:31:21.770
<i>I think I was hurt a lot
because of those things.</i>

371
00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:24.649
<i>The best thing about being in the US</i>

372
00:31:24.649 --> 00:31:28.318
<i>was that people believed
in my dreams and talent.</i>

373
00:31:29.627 --> 00:31:33.661
<i>Suddenly, I developed a stubbornness.</i>

374
00:31:33.661 --> 00:31:35.755
<i>I wanted to show the people in Korea...</i>

375
00:31:36.966 --> 00:31:39.437
<i>that I could do it.</i>

376
00:31:39.437 --> 00:31:42.974
<i>It was a very genuine
feeling in my heart.</i>

377
00:31:42.974 --> 00:31:44.645
<i>I was very certain about that.</i>

378
00:31:46.226 --> 00:31:48.146
<i>I was very disappointed though.</i>

379
00:31:48.146 --> 00:31:50.556
<i>There were some people in Korea
I cared about deeply.</i>

380
00:31:52.044 --> 00:31:53.484
<i>They just couldn't see it.</i>

381
00:31:57.857 --> 00:32:00.635
<i>In the end, I played golf like crazy.</i>

382
00:32:00.635 --> 00:32:03.177
<i>I was recognized for it and here I am.</i>

383
00:32:03.177 --> 00:32:05.586
We're going to tie things up now.

384
00:32:05.586 --> 00:32:09.455
I'll ask you a final question.

385
00:32:09.455 --> 00:32:13.595
At an age when other pro golfers
hit their peak and are retiring

386
00:32:13.595 --> 00:32:15.885
you started golfing.

387
00:32:15.885 --> 00:32:17.354
That's right.

388
00:32:17.354 --> 00:32:21.526
That's why I needed to work
much harder than anyone else.

389
00:32:21.526 --> 00:32:25.357
There are also my wife's
hidden sacrifices, as well.

390
00:32:27.205 --> 00:32:29.946
I have never played a game
purely for myself.

391
00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:33.686
It took me a long time to get to my peak.

392
00:32:33.686 --> 00:32:37.684
I plan to stay on top for a long time.

393
00:32:37.684 --> 00:32:39.604
For the sake of my wife,
who suffered for me.

394
00:32:41.624 --> 00:32:44.128
The only dream I have now...

395
00:32:44.128 --> 00:32:46.279
is to make my wife happy.

396
00:32:54.371 --> 00:32:56.517
He's a very cool man.

397
00:32:56.517 --> 00:32:58.158
As an athlete...

398
00:32:59.557 --> 00:33:00.937
and as a man.

399
00:33:02.693 --> 00:33:03.919
Yes.

400
00:33:07.450 --> 00:33:10.457
That was a very wise answer.

401
00:33:10.457 --> 00:33:11.896
Thank you.

402
00:33:11.896 --> 00:33:15.457
I hope you continue to succeed.

403
00:33:15.457 --> 00:33:16.656
Thank you.

404
00:33:18.935 --> 00:33:21.055
That was Kevin Lee.

405
00:33:36.288 --> 00:33:39.392
<i>The reaction on
the internet is explosive.</i>

406
00:33:39.392 --> 00:33:41.521
He's number one in the search rankings.

407
00:33:41.521 --> 00:33:44.821
I suppose it's all due to your
great visuals and sense of humor.

408
00:33:46.017 --> 00:33:47.646
Besides all of that...

409
00:33:47.646 --> 00:33:51.310
I think your honesty was
what people really liked.

410
00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:55.027
This is all thanks to Anchor Go Hye Ran
for setting up the interview.

411
00:33:56.688 --> 00:33:57.993
Thanks, Hye Ran.

412
00:33:59.077 --> 00:34:04.044
Now that you brought that up,
can I propose an offer?

413
00:34:04.044 --> 00:34:05.085
Yes.

414
00:34:05.085 --> 00:34:10.013
We're planning a new human
documentary program right now.

415
00:34:10.013 --> 00:34:13.928
I would like to have you,
Kevin Lee, as our first guest.

416
00:34:15.807 --> 00:34:17.838
- My husband?
- Yes.

417
00:34:17.838 --> 00:34:22.127
Not the golfer Kevin Lee,
but Kevin Lee, the man.

418
00:34:22.127 --> 00:34:26.127
It was really touching when you
were talking about your wife.

419
00:34:26.127 --> 00:34:27.627
Oh, yes.

420
00:34:27.627 --> 00:34:32.886
So, I'd like to continue on
and tell your story.

421
00:34:32.886 --> 00:34:35.171
What do you think about that?

422
00:34:37.642 --> 00:34:39.484
I don't know.

423
00:34:39.484 --> 00:34:41.488
I haven't done much
besides being an athlete.

424
00:34:41.488 --> 00:34:43.968
Then what if...

425
00:34:43.968 --> 00:34:47.789
Go Hye Ran takes it on herself?

426
00:34:47.789 --> 00:34:49.564
Then would you consider it?

427
00:34:49.564 --> 00:34:50.720
Really?

428
00:34:53.033 --> 00:34:54.292
Would you?

429
00:34:57.330 --> 00:35:01.149
If so, then I'll consider it favorably.

430
00:35:01.149 --> 00:35:02.972
Favorably. Favorably?

431
00:35:04.406 --> 00:35:06.189
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

432
00:35:07.863 --> 00:35:10.202
Go Hye Ran, you heard that?
You did, right?

433
00:35:10.202 --> 00:35:11.932
You heard what Kevin Lee said?

434
00:35:11.932 --> 00:35:13.294
Thank you.

435
00:35:25.213 --> 00:35:28.015
I showed you what
I can do with Kevin Lee.

436
00:35:28.015 --> 00:35:30.403
Why are you suddenly
going back on your word?

437
00:35:37.703 --> 00:35:40.502
I showed you what
I can do with Kevin Lee.

438
00:35:40.502 --> 00:35:42.575
Why are you suddenly
going back on your word?

439
00:35:42.575 --> 00:35:45.966
The national ratings were 19 percent.

440
00:35:45.966 --> 00:35:49.714
If the news got 19 percent,
that's like 50 percent.

441
00:35:49.714 --> 00:35:53.334
If we do the human project,
we're a monopoly.

442
00:35:54.745 --> 00:35:57.493
We should lose that chance just
because you don't like it?

443
00:35:57.493 --> 00:35:59.914
Also, Kevin Lee says it has to be you.

444
00:35:59.914 --> 00:36:03.557
- Director.
- It's news, so you'd be the PD.

445
00:36:03.557 --> 00:36:06.845
Follow them and be Go Hye Ran.

446
00:36:06.845 --> 00:36:08.767
Live up to your name.

447
00:36:08.767 --> 00:36:11.930
Leave News Nine to Han Ji Won.

448
00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:15.171
She may not be as good as you,
but Han Ji Won is ambitious.

449
00:36:15.171 --> 00:36:16.961
She'll do well.

450
00:36:16.961 --> 00:36:20.310
Does Han Ji Won have something on you?

451
00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:23.146
Why are you dying to put
Han Ji Won in that seat?

452
00:36:23.146 --> 00:36:25.756
It was me who put you in that seat too.

453
00:36:25.756 --> 00:36:30.287
Did I give you News Nine because
you had something on me?

454
00:36:30.287 --> 00:36:33.555
I have an eye for things, and a feeling.

455
00:36:33.555 --> 00:36:34.946
You know that very well.

456
00:36:38.004 --> 00:36:40.046
This is it for you, Go Hye Ran.

457
00:36:40.046 --> 00:36:43.627
Come down quietly while you can.

- Yes?
- About Kam's case...

468
00:38:08.031 --> 00:38:10.231
Can you find the medical files for me?

469
00:38:10.231 --> 00:38:11.321
Okay.

470
00:38:13.113 --> 00:38:15.428
Yes, where did they go?

I'm always up all night,

<i>The caller cannot take your call...</i>

What do you think you're doing?

About the human documentary

478
00:38:54.044 --> 00:38:55.493
can I really do it?

<i>You don't have to

Today's interview was more than enough.

481
00:39:03.662 --> 00:39:04.783
Why?

482
00:39:06.374 --> 00:39:08.392

485
00:39:14.127 --> 00:39:18.100
He usually gets nervous around cameras.

486
00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:19.984

with you, Hye Ran.

487

Kevin Lee is the new model for S Company.

501
00:40:47.459 --> 00:40:50.783
It's better for us if he's hot.

Isn't that right, Go Hye Ran?

503
00:40:53.084 --> 00:40:55.685
All the sports product companies
have made offers to him.

504
00:40:55.685 --> 00:40:57.627
Cell phone and refrigerator
commercials too.

505
00:40:57.627 --> 00:40:59.707
I heard he has about 20.

506
00:40:59.707 --> 00:41:02.176
Wow, all together...

507
00:41:04.662 --> 00:41:06.756

I'm talking about Kevin Lee's wife.

512
00:41:53.325 --> 00:41:55.852
I heard she was
your high school classmate.

513
00:42:00.073 --> 00:42:01.383
Who said that?

514
00:42:01.383 --> 00:42:03.472
Seo Eun Joo told me.

515
00:42:03.472 --> 00:42:06.765
She said you two were
best friends during high school.

516
00:42:06.765 --> 00:42:10.044
She said she wasn't smart like you,
so she couldn't go to college.

517
00:42:10.044 --> 00:42:12.359
She was working in her mom's restaurant.

518
00:42:12.359 --> 00:42:14.953
She met an amateur golfer
who had just gotten dumped.

519
00:42:14.953 --> 00:42:19.033
She spent years cleaning buildings
and supporting him.

520
00:42:19.033 --> 00:42:21.504
Then her life changed, just like that.

521
00:42:22.504 --> 00:42:26.167
Now, she's the woman
that women in Korea envy the most.

522
00:42:28.265 --> 00:42:30.725
Women in Korea envy her the most?

You didn't know?

00:42:32.635 --> 00:42:34.664
It's all over the internet

Any site where married women congregate,
all they talk about is Kevin Lee.

00:42:38.475 --> 00:42:41.004
He's talented and hot.

527
00:42:41.004 --> 00:42:43.225
He has lots of money.

528
00:42:43.225 --> 00:42:45.024
He's good looking.

529
00:42:45.024 --> 00:42:47.002
He even has a sense of humor.

530
00:42:48.883 --> 00:42:50.314
He's sexy too.

Oh, that's right.

You're shooting Kevin Lee today.

545

It'll be hard.

546
00:43:34.926 --> 00:43:38.781
You haven't been out on location
in a while, so it'll be difficult.

Oh, that was awkward.

551
00:44:36.854 --> 00:44:38.327
I shouldn't have agreed to do it.

552
00:44:38.327 --> 00:44:40.901
Why? You're doing well.

553
00:44:40.901 --> 00:44:42.001

00:46:14.082 --> 00:46:16.568
One, two. That's great.

565
00:46:16.568 --> 00:46:17.763
Awesome.

566
00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:20.856
Very good. That was great.

567
00:46:20.856 --> 00:46:23.667
That's enough for you Mrs. Lee.
Let's get shots of you alone, Kevin.

568
00:46:24.888 --> 00:46:27.707
Thank you. Thank you.

569
00:46:30.118 --> 00:46:32.169
I shouldn't have agreed to do that.

570
00:46:32.169 --> 00:46:33.531
What if I look strange?

571
00:46:33.531 --> 00:46:36.269
It's a print ad. It'll look nice.

572

touch it up and it will look great.

- Oh, that...

575
00:46:47.196 --> 00:46:49.026
It's not good for me right now.

576
00:46:49.026 --> 00:46:51.193
I have to tie things up at News Nine.

577
00:46:51.193 --> 00:46:53.854
What? You're not doing News Nine?

578
00:46:56.283 --> 00:46:57.903
I had a long run.

579
00:46:57.903 --> 00:47:00.493
It's good to let
a talented junior take over.

580

Still, I only watched
News Nine because of you.

581
00:47:05.184 --> 00:47:06.234
Thanks.

582
00:47:06.234 --> 00:47:08.673
Don't be that way. Make some time.

583
00:47:08.673 --> 00:47:11.964
We finally left the hotel
and got a house.

584
00:47:11.964 --> 00:47:14.966
It can be a housewarming
and a party to console you.

585
00:47:14.966 --> 00:47:16.863
Let's have dinner together, huh?

00:47:26.287 --> 00:47:29.778
- No need to make things complicated.
- Do I make you uncomfortable?

589
00:47:29.778 --> 00:47:31.030
Oh my. Does he?

590
00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:33.122
Does my husband make you uncomfortable?

591
00:47:35.481 --> 00:47:36.571
No.

592
00:47:38.231 --> 00:47:39.944
Why would I be uncomfortable?

593
00:47:41.011 --> 00:47:42.861
I'm not uncomfortable at all.

594
00:47:42.861 --> 00:47:46.401
Then come over for dinner.

00:47:52.281 --> 00:47:54.861
Let's find a day that we can do that.

598
00:47:54.861 --> 00:47:58.981
That's great. I'm so curious
about your husband.

599
00:47:58.981 --> 00:48:01.881

Yes.

612

Also, you should just get

646
00:52:32.239 --> 00:52:33.706
I can go too, right?

647
00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:58.094
Oh my. You're alone.

648
00:52:58.094 --> 00:53:00.473
I thought the director would be with you.

649
00:53:01.605 --> 00:53:04.264
He went to go get Go Hye Ran.

650
00:53:05.282 --> 00:53:06.514
I see.

651
00:53:08.891 --> 00:53:10.529
By any chance...

652
00:53:10.529 --> 00:53:14.299
aren't you the anchor who
temporarily took over News Nine?

653
00:53:14.299 --> 00:53:17.029
It's an honor for me that you remember.

654
00:53:17.029 --> 00:53:18.799
My name is Han Ji Won.

655
00:53:18.799 --> 00:53:20.975
Nice to meet you.
I'm Kevin Lee.

656
00:53:23.009 --> 00:53:26.605
Does someone in your
high position run beverage errands?

657
00:53:26.605 --> 00:53:27.683
No.

658
00:53:28.732 --> 00:53:30.882
Only for special people.

659
00:53:53.087 --> 00:53:55.643
I was getting him a drink. Bye now.

660
00:54:02.498 --> 00:54:03.703
What was that?

661
00:54:03.703 --> 00:54:07.203
She doesn't even get her own coffee.

662
00:54:07.203 --> 00:54:10.206
What are you doing?
Take him to the editing room.

663
00:54:10.206 --> 00:54:11.243
Kevin.

664
00:54:23.855 --> 00:54:25.918
Choi Byung Man must
have bribed the doctors.

665
00:54:25.918 --> 00:54:28.107
They had no conscience at all.

666
00:54:28.107 --> 00:54:30.288
How can a nosebleed need
to be admitted for six weeks?

667
00:54:30.288 --> 00:54:31.797
They insist that's what he needs.

668
00:54:31.797 --> 00:54:34.648
If he had broken his nose,
they'd have declared him dead.

669
00:54:34.648 --> 00:54:38.067
I'm afraid that Kam
will have to buy a plane ticket.

670
00:54:38.067 --> 00:54:41.000
He will have to go back to his home.

671
00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:42.248
That's just my opinion.

672
00:54:43.288 --> 00:54:46.478
We'd better eat a lot
to get strong and fight hard.

673
00:54:47.389 --> 00:54:48.590
What will you have?

674
00:54:50.348 --> 00:54:51.752
The most expensive thing.

675
00:54:51.752 --> 00:54:53.875
This one. It's new.

676
00:54:53.875 --> 00:54:55.520
Ham and mozzarella. Two of them.

677
00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:57.679
I'll help the next customer first.

678
00:54:57.679 --> 00:55:00.101
- Next person.
- Hello.

679
00:55:00.101 --> 00:55:01.355
- I'll have...
- I found it!

680
00:55:03.431 --> 00:55:06.141
Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry.

681
00:55:06.141 --> 00:55:07.435
Would you like to go first?

682
00:55:07.435 --> 00:55:09.368
No, go ahead. It's okay.

683
00:55:09.368 --> 00:55:11.052
Thank you.

684
00:55:11.052 --> 00:55:12.212
Oh, I found it.

685
00:55:17.898 --> 00:55:19.398
That's Kevin Lee's wife.

686
00:55:19.398 --> 00:55:22.699
That famous golfer, Kevin Lee.
That's his wife.

687
00:55:23.929 --> 00:55:25.580
Next customer.

688
00:55:27.429 --> 00:55:32.179
Two mozzarella sandwiches
and a butter croissant.

689
00:55:37.444 --> 00:55:39.534
Hye Ran, it's me.

690
00:55:40.975 --> 00:55:42.083
What do I do?

691
00:55:42.996 --> 00:55:46.375
I just don't think I can pick him up.

692
00:55:46.375 --> 00:55:48.993
No, it's just that the furniture
is being delivered late.

693
00:55:50.378 --> 00:55:54.918
After work, can you
drive my husband home?

694
00:55:54.918 --> 00:55:58.647
Here are your sandwiches
and drinks. Please enjoy.

695
00:55:58.647 --> 00:56:01.567
Really? Thank you, Hye Ran.

696
00:56:01.567 --> 00:56:03.851
Thank you so much. Yeah.

697
00:56:11.210 --> 00:56:13.261
<i>I really had nothing in the past.</i>

698
00:56:13.261 --> 00:56:17.467
You haven't done many interviews,
but you're very good at them.

699
00:56:45.652 --> 00:56:48.181
It's me, Reporter Kwak.

700
00:56:48.181 --> 00:56:51.282
I'm really not feeling very well today.

701
00:56:51.282 --> 00:56:54.163
After the news today...

702
00:56:54.163 --> 00:56:56.712
I think I need to go home early today.

703
00:56:58.427 --> 00:57:01.500
Once you're done monitoring

704
00:57:01.500 --> 00:57:05.310
can you drive Kevin Lee home today?

705
00:57:05.310 --> 00:57:06.801
Yeah.

706
00:57:06.801 --> 00:57:11.049
His wife is very busy
with the interior of their new house.

707
00:57:11.049 --> 00:57:13.648
Yes, do me this favor.

708
00:57:34.123 --> 00:57:36.397
Please put the sofa inside.

709
00:57:39.058 --> 00:57:41.016
You must be tired.

710
00:57:41.016 --> 00:57:42.301
Have some coffee.

711
00:57:42.301 --> 00:57:44.150
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

712
00:57:46.699 --> 00:57:48.090
Thank you for your work.

713
00:57:48.090 --> 00:57:49.380
- Thank you.
- Yes.

714
00:57:50.409 --> 00:57:52.268
Sandwich.

715
00:58:10.859 --> 00:58:12.319
Ji Won did?

716
00:58:12.319 --> 00:58:15.561
She said she was headed that way anyway.

717
00:58:15.561 --> 00:58:18.467
She said she would
take him on her way there.

718
00:58:18.467 --> 00:58:19.525
Did she?

719
00:58:21.210 --> 00:58:22.440
That worked out well.

720
00:58:24.252 --> 00:58:26.860
Thanks for doing the editing.

721
00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:28.696
Okay.

722
00:58:28.696 --> 00:58:29.741
Good work.

723
00:59:59.427 --> 01:00:01.123
He's running very late.

After work, can you

<i>They just couldn't see it.</i>

Don't you know image is your life
as the 9 p.m. anchor?

Hey. What happened here?

734
01:02:14.261 --> 01:02:15.672
Where did these come from?

735

Shut your mouth!

- She took a sick day today.
- What?

739
01:02:30.250 --> 01:02:32.420
She said she wasn't feeling well
and wanted some rest.

740
01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:35.618
Bring her here now!
No, you escort her here.

Right this instant!

742

You owe me a debt now.

You need to be mobile in order

I'll keep that in mind,

Scary wench.

he was a guest and I was the host.

772
01:05:12.980 --> 01:05:15.096
He was also my friend's husband.

773

That was all there was to it.

774

Yes.

That is right.

It would be best for you to believe it.

779
01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:36.290
It will cause problems
for you if you don't.

780
01:05:39.895 --> 01:05:43.163
You don't want to see those pictures
on the internet, do you?

781
01:05:44.188 --> 01:05:47.351
Then you'd be finished in this field.

782
01:05:57.152 --> 01:05:58.817
So, it was your doing.

783
01:06:00.118 --> 01:06:01.246
Wasn't it?

784
01:06:04.328 --> 01:06:05.723
So, why?

785
01:06:07.054 --> 01:06:09.833
Why did you do such a thing?

786
01:06:09.833 --> 01:06:11.944
You should've been careful.

787
01:06:11.944 --> 01:06:15.902
You shouldn't go after another person's
husband so carelessly, Ji Won.

788
01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:40.286
Can I get going now?

789
01:06:41.092 --> 01:06:43.163
It's almost time for me to go.

790
01:06:43.165 --> 01:06:44.170
Five minutes.

791
01:06:45.179 --> 01:06:47.069
Give me exactly five minutes.

792
01:06:48.069 --> 01:06:50.409
I have one more picture.

793
01:06:50.409 --> 01:06:52.018
What picture is that?

794
01:07:05.746 --> 01:07:08.413
Have you seen this before?

795
01:07:14.197 --> 01:07:17.931
It looks like a women's brooch to me.

796
01:07:17.931 --> 01:07:20.411
Have you seen it before?

797
01:07:20.411 --> 01:07:21.610
Why is this...

798
01:07:21.610 --> 01:07:23.958
It was found inside the car
at the scene of the accident.

799
01:07:30.612 --> 01:07:32.888
Inside the car that was in an accident?

800
01:07:48.355 --> 01:07:52.165
It looks like the same brooch you were
wearing on the day of the accident.

801
01:07:53.585 --> 01:07:54.755
Is that correct?

802

It appears to be your brooch, Go Hye Ran.

Is that correct?

804

Why was that brooch in the car?

805
01:08:22.456 --> 01:08:24.463
Can you explain that?

806
01:08:37.281 --> 01:08:38.574
Go Hye Ran?

807
01:08:47.648 --> 01:08:49.368
I have to answer with, no comment.

808
01:09:08.325 --> 01:09:11.722
Are you not answering because
