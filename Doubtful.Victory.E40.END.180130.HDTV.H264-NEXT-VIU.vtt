I think you should watch the news.

Prosecutor Kim...

5
00:00:17.895 --> 00:00:20.936
released a recording file of an ex-NIS agent...

6
00:00:20.936 --> 00:00:24.765
claiming that former president Lee ordered him to commit murder.

7
00:00:33.976 --> 00:00:36.576
What do you think you're doing right now?

8
00:00:37.186 --> 00:00:40.455
How can you release false information on the news?

9
00:00:41.216 --> 00:00:44.156
You should have a solution to this situation!

Shut it!

Call my attorneys, and tell them to come see me right now!

Who...

14
00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:02.375
in the world is behind this, and what is that person trying to do?

(former president, Lee Kwang Ho, had instigated murder.)

17
00:01:15.886 --> 00:01:17.955
You should release all the evidence regarding Lee Kwang Ho's crimes...

18
00:01:18.556 --> 00:01:19.886
to the press.

19

How do you plan on doing that?

20
00:01:21.796 --> 00:01:22.925

(former president, Lee Kwang Ho, had instigated murder.)

24

Prosecutor Kim finally made a big move.

25
00:01:40.546 --> 00:01:43.576
Now, Lee Kwang Ho just has to hold a press conference. Then...

26

Anyway,

27

Lieutenant Jin came all the way here to welcome you.

32
00:02:22.986 --> 00:02:24.586
I got stabbed...

33
00:02:24.855 --> 00:02:27.225
and received poisoned water from him, so this is the least I can do.

34
00:02:27.496 --> 00:02:30.325
On top of that, you also dared to threaten Inspector Park's family...

35
00:02:30.426 --> 00:02:32.295
for such a long time.

36

Tell me the truth.

37

Who told you to keep...

38
00:02:40.676 --> 00:02:42.806
Han Cha Kyung and Han Kang as hostages?

39
00:02:44.875 --> 00:02:45.906

Yes, you're right.

Unfortunately, you were caught by us.

46
00:03:07.135 --> 00:03:09.795
We already know you committed numerous crimes.

47

It's one or the other for you.

48

Either you rot in prison for the rest of your life,

49

or the one who hired you...

50
00:03:17.306 --> 00:03:19.575
will get scared and do what they did to Baek Kyung.

51

I'll see you around.

to the bottom of your crimes!

I look good in anything.

62
00:04:06.385 --> 00:04:08.095
Why did you suddenly ask me out for dinner?

63
00:04:08.255 --> 00:04:12.366
No reason. We're partners, but I never took you out.

How is it going exactly the way we wanted?

67

It's not by chance.

68

Lee Kwang Ho is only doing what he always does.

69

I guess so.

76

I've been framed.

172
00:10:24.165 --> 00:10:26.465
This is a conspiracy! Conspiracy!

173
00:10:26.636 --> 00:10:27.805
Conspiracy, I tell you!

174
00:10:30.136 --> 00:10:31.646
You have the right to remain silent...

175
00:10:31.646 --> 00:10:33.506
and the right to an attorney.

176
00:10:34.016 --> 00:10:35.045
Let's go.

177
00:10:44.156 --> 00:10:45.526
I'll do it.

178
00:11:01.106 --> 00:11:02.205
I'm sorry.

179
00:11:03.305 --> 00:11:04.906
This was the only way.

180
00:11:05.276 --> 00:11:06.746
I figured as much.

181
00:11:08.675 --> 00:11:10.585
At least you're Kim Jong Sam now.

182
00:11:14.785 --> 00:11:18.085
It's nice to see you again, Kim Jong Sam.

183
00:11:22.425 --> 00:11:23.795
It's shocking that a former president...

184
00:11:23.795 --> 00:11:26.665
is charged for instigating murder.

185
00:11:26.665 --> 00:11:27.896
Please say something.

186
00:11:30.935 --> 00:11:33.835
That's what it means to be a president of Korea.

187
00:11:35.075 --> 00:11:37.445
Out of all the previous presidents,

188
00:11:38.346 --> 00:11:41.045
who hasn't killed anyone?

189
00:11:41.876 --> 00:11:44.746
They torture people to their deaths or shoot them.

190
00:11:45.016 --> 00:11:46.715
Some get framed before being murdered.

191
00:11:47.116 --> 00:11:48.185
However,

192
00:11:49.955 --> 00:11:51.626
I'm innocent.

193
00:11:52.055 --> 00:11:53.325
Lee Kwang Ho!

194
00:11:53.626 --> 00:11:55.425
- It's a gun! - Run!

195
00:11:55.695 --> 00:11:57.596
- Watch out! - My goodness!

196
00:12:03.636 --> 00:12:04.866
You're innocent?

197
00:12:05.606 --> 00:12:08.535
What a joke. You're a murderer!

198
00:12:14.776 --> 00:12:15.846
Manager Lee!

199
00:12:17.215 --> 00:12:18.886
Watch out.

200
00:12:19.386 --> 00:12:20.386
What is going on?

201
00:12:40.106 --> 00:12:41.175
Die!

202
00:12:41.736 --> 00:12:44.376
You deserve to die, Lee Kwang Ho!

203
00:12:45.846 --> 00:12:47.146
Lee Kwang Ho!

204
00:12:47.846 --> 00:12:49.246
Lee Kwang Ho!

205
00:12:51.685 --> 00:12:54.285
In 1992, he ordered the murder and the disposal of the corpse...

206
00:12:54.285 --> 00:12:56.285
of the adoptee, Lee Young Min.

207
00:12:56.986 --> 00:13:00.795
In 1997, he instigated the murder of Choi Yeon Mi.

208
00:13:01.026 --> 00:13:02.226
In 2007,

209
00:13:02.226 --> 00:13:05.065
he attempted to murder Hong Mi Ok, and hid the evidence.

210
00:13:05.695 --> 00:13:08.496
Accepted illegal campaign fund from Jin Jung Gil,

211
00:13:08.695 --> 00:13:10.266
then blackmailed and instigated his murder.

212
00:13:10.266 --> 00:13:11.366
- Hurry. - Yes, sir.

213
00:13:11.366 --> 00:13:15.106
In 2017, he ordered the kidnapping of Han Kang,

214
00:13:15.835 --> 00:13:18.846
and instigated the murders of Cha Gwang Tae, Jang Pil Sung,

215
00:13:19.276 --> 00:13:24.085
Oh Il Seung, Kim Jong Sam, and Geum Byul.

216
00:13:24.386 --> 00:13:26.685
In addition, embezzlement of NIS' special project funds,

217
00:13:27.085 --> 00:13:30.856
leaked state funds and flew assets abroad.

218
00:13:31.325 --> 00:13:33.856
Close acquaintances have collected the evidence...

219
00:13:33.856 --> 00:13:36.356
to prove he was responsible for the said charges.

220
00:13:36.626 --> 00:13:40.195
All are under arrest and going under interrogation.

221
00:13:48.935 --> 00:13:51.776
(Public Prosecutors' Office)

222
00:14:10.726 --> 00:14:11.896
Thank you.

223
00:14:11.896 --> 00:14:13.526
It was nothing.

224
00:14:13.866 --> 00:14:15.596
- Take care. - Bye.

225
00:14:45.766 --> 00:14:47.136
Good work, Jong Sam.

226
00:14:49.335 --> 00:14:50.506
Also, thank you.

227
00:14:53.876 --> 00:14:54.906
Hey.

228
00:14:56.406 --> 00:14:58.305
You have to go back to prison, don't you?

229
00:15:01.876 --> 00:15:03.016
It's okay.

230
00:15:04.685 --> 00:15:06.715
I'll be released after a couple of winters.

231
00:15:09.415 --> 00:15:11.455
We promised to see the spring rain together,

232
00:15:12.585 --> 00:15:13.726
but it's snowing.

233
00:15:20.835 --> 00:15:22.935
Next time, we'll see the spring rain together.

234
00:15:27.106 --> 00:15:29.535
By then, everyone will know...

235
00:15:31.346 --> 00:15:32.506
that you...

236
00:15:39.715 --> 00:15:40.785
are innocent.

237
00:15:48.096 --> 00:15:52.496
According to Section 1, Article 435 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,

238
00:15:52.496 --> 00:15:56.866
we'll start the retrial of the Odong Blowfish House Murder case.

239
00:16:03.376 --> 00:16:04.705
What's wrong? Do you feel strange?

240
00:16:05.445 --> 00:16:07.545
Does he look too different from when you last saw him?

241
00:16:08.616 --> 00:16:09.876
Is he sick?

242
00:16:10.915 --> 00:16:11.915
Yes.

243
00:16:12.085 --> 00:16:13.785
Is he sleeping because he's sick?

244
00:16:14.315 --> 00:16:15.555
When will he get better?

245
00:16:16.085 --> 00:16:18.585
I'm not sure. We don't know.

246
00:16:27.295 --> 00:16:29.435
Are you upset because of him?

247
00:16:31.506 --> 00:16:33.035
Because your friend...

248
00:16:34.575 --> 00:16:36.175
won't wake up?

249
00:16:36.935 --> 00:16:38.276
Of course, I'm upset.

250
00:16:41.776 --> 00:16:44.486
I want to play with him, but we can't.

251
00:16:50.185 --> 00:16:51.256
Then,

252
00:16:53.185 --> 00:16:55.055
why are we here?

253
00:16:56.356 --> 00:16:58.795
If he's sleeping,

254
00:16:59.925 --> 00:17:01.795
you can't play with him.

255
00:17:03.565 --> 00:17:04.665
Kang.

256
00:17:06.836 --> 00:17:09.406
There is something you should know.

257
00:17:12.146 --> 00:17:13.275
Hey,

258
00:17:14.316 --> 00:17:16.076
do you know your dad's name?

259
00:17:20.515 --> 00:17:22.056
I know you know his name.

260
00:17:24.386 --> 00:17:25.626
Kang?

261
00:17:27.396 --> 00:17:30.396
Kang Chul Gi.

262
00:17:32.225 --> 00:17:34.735
Yes. Kang Chul Gi.

263
00:17:38.606 --> 00:17:39.636
Say hello.

264
00:17:44.146 --> 00:17:46.406
Kang Chul Gi. He's your dad.

265
00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:04.430
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E40 Doubtful Victory "I'm Kim Sam Jong"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

266
00:18:29.015 --> 00:18:31.955
I think Kang was startled.

267
00:18:32.425 --> 00:18:34.955
Of course. It's all very sudden to him.

268
00:18:36.626 --> 00:18:38.025
He'll be fine.

269
00:18:38.695 --> 00:18:42.636
He'll be really happy later on.

270
00:18:43.806 --> 00:18:47.735
He was waiting so long for Chul Gi. It's his dad.

271
00:18:51.146 --> 00:18:52.745
Su Chil, I...

272
00:18:52.745 --> 00:18:54.945
No, no. No.

273
00:18:55.515 --> 00:18:56.846
I didn't say anything.

274
00:18:56.846 --> 00:18:59.316
I'm fine. I mean it.

275
00:19:00.856 --> 00:19:01.915
I'm really fine.

276
00:19:04.425 --> 00:19:08.096
I'm sure it's the same with you.

277
00:19:09.056 --> 00:19:10.096
Well...

278
00:19:10.725 --> 00:19:12.725
How can we not visit when Chul Gi is sick?

279
00:19:13.366 --> 00:19:15.465
Right? I can understand.

280
00:19:15.896 --> 00:19:16.965
I'm fine.

281
00:19:17.336 --> 00:19:18.705
Well, I'm not.

282
00:19:20.536 --> 00:19:23.376
I'm not okay with you being fine.

283
00:19:24.906 --> 00:19:26.245
What kind of father...

284
00:19:26.245 --> 00:19:28.775
is okay with their child getting another father?

285
00:19:29.646 --> 00:19:31.945
It's not normal to be okay.

286
00:19:31.945 --> 00:19:33.515
Why do you keep on saying you're fine?

287
00:19:33.515 --> 00:19:34.586
It makes me sad.

288
00:19:35.715 --> 00:19:36.816
Are you sad?

289
00:19:40.326 --> 00:19:41.425
I'm sad too.

290
00:19:45.995 --> 00:19:50.566
I'm not sad because Kang knows who his father is.

291
00:19:52.306 --> 00:19:54.376
It's just that everything that's happening...

292
00:19:54.876 --> 00:19:56.036
is reasonable.

293
00:19:56.036 --> 00:19:57.576
That makes me sad.

294
00:20:01.445 --> 00:20:03.146
It's natural for Kang...

295
00:20:03.546 --> 00:20:05.786
to call Chul Gi his dad.

296
00:20:07.715 --> 00:20:11.225
It's natural for you to worry...

297
00:20:11.556 --> 00:20:12.725
about Chul Gi too.

298
00:20:13.556 --> 00:20:16.596
They're all very reasonable, and that makes me sad.

299
00:20:20.025 --> 00:20:21.036
Also,

300
00:20:21.796 --> 00:20:22.896
it's...

301
00:20:24.965 --> 00:20:26.406
all very natural, but...

302
00:20:32.306 --> 00:20:34.816
It makes me sad that I'm upset about it.

303
00:20:36.475 --> 00:20:38.445
Am I getting in the way?

304
00:20:39.745 --> 00:20:41.786
Would everything be better if I wasn't around?

305
00:20:41.786 --> 00:20:43.215
It all makes me sad.

306
00:20:55.165 --> 00:20:56.796
I would die without you.

307
00:20:59.066 --> 00:21:01.036
How can I live without you?

308
00:21:02.935 --> 00:21:04.546
Same with Kang.

309
00:21:07.175 --> 00:21:08.515
Didn't you know that?

310
00:21:35.306 --> 00:21:37.205
Are you really Kang Chul Gi?

311
00:21:49.685 --> 00:21:50.786
Are you awake?

312
00:21:51.586 --> 00:21:53.955
I'm Kang. Han Kang.

313
00:21:55.255 --> 00:21:56.396
Do you know who I am?

314
00:21:57.326 --> 00:21:58.725
I know you too.

315
00:22:00.636 --> 00:22:03.336
I know you're my dad. Kang Chul Gi.

316
00:22:19.786 --> 00:22:22.556
(Three years later)

317
00:22:22.556 --> 00:22:23.616
Are you doing well?

318
00:22:28.126 --> 00:22:29.725
Who sent you?

319
00:22:31.096 --> 00:22:32.195
General Manager Kwak.

320
00:22:37.806 --> 00:22:39.205
You look the same, Assistant Manager Ki.

321
00:22:43.136 --> 00:22:44.205
What are you doing these days?

322
00:22:45.005 --> 00:22:47.316
I'm looking for a job.

323
00:22:47.816 --> 00:22:48.846
Good.

324
00:22:51.586 --> 00:22:53.386
You should go visit Chairwoman Gook.

325
00:22:54.485 --> 00:22:57.286
She doesn't have anyone to visit her.

326
00:23:04.296 --> 00:23:05.765
You can go if you have nothing else to say.

327
00:23:07.636 --> 00:23:09.336
When I was with the NIS,

328
00:23:10.935 --> 00:23:12.265
I didn't know...

329
00:23:14.435 --> 00:23:16.536
what we were doing was so terrible.

330
00:23:18.576 --> 00:23:20.205
Because everyone was doing it,

331
00:23:21.316 --> 00:23:23.015
so I just thought...

332
00:23:24.745 --> 00:23:26.316
I had to do the same.

333
00:23:28.685 --> 00:23:30.955
But we shouldn't have been doing the things we did.

334
00:23:32.255 --> 00:23:35.296
Chairwoman Gook. There's probably...

335
00:23:36.925 --> 00:23:38.866
a lot of people like me.

336
00:23:40.636 --> 00:23:43.465
People who do as they are told.

337
00:23:46.106 --> 00:23:47.505
By following your boss' orders,

338
00:23:48.336 --> 00:23:50.505
you can be an ordinary public servant,

339
00:23:51.945 --> 00:23:54.245
or you can turn into a murderer.

340
00:23:55.076 --> 00:23:56.215
Go.

341
00:23:57.745 --> 00:23:59.086
Never come back.

342
00:24:03.086 --> 00:24:04.126
Okay.

343
00:24:05.925 --> 00:24:06.955
Well...

344
00:24:08.396 --> 00:24:10.156
Take care, Chairwoman Gook.

345
00:24:37.156 --> 00:24:38.286
Inspector Cho.

346
00:24:38.286 --> 00:24:40.556
- Hello. - Hello, everyone.

347
00:24:40.556 --> 00:24:41.725
Hi.

348
00:24:42.656 --> 00:24:45.665
Inspector Cho, you didn't have to bring this.

349
00:24:45.665 --> 00:24:46.765
How are you doing?

350
00:24:46.866 --> 00:24:49.735
I'm doing well. I'm a bit bored...

351
00:24:49.735 --> 00:24:51.005
after retirement though.

352
00:24:51.366 --> 00:24:52.366
Anyway,

353
00:24:52.366 --> 00:24:53.465
I heard your son graduated.

354
00:24:53.505 --> 00:24:55.036
Yes. He got first prize...

355
00:24:55.376 --> 00:24:56.876
- in origami. - Really?

356
00:24:56.876 --> 00:24:58.076
- In origami? - Yes.

357
00:24:58.346 --> 00:24:59.376
Have some.

358
00:24:59.376 --> 00:25:00.546
- Okay. - Here you go.

359
00:25:01.445 --> 00:25:02.975
- Yes? - It's good.

360
00:25:03.576 --> 00:25:05.015
- Take more. - It's delicious.

361
00:25:05.286 --> 00:25:06.786
- What? - It's good.

362
00:25:06.886 --> 00:25:08.685
Okay.

363
00:25:08.685 --> 00:25:10.455
- Sir. - Yes?

364
00:25:10.455 --> 00:25:11.786
- We have to move. - Why?

365
00:25:11.786 --> 00:25:13.356
It's Gyeong Soo's gang.

366
00:25:13.356 --> 00:25:16.396
Why do they have to make trouble now?

367
00:25:16.656 --> 00:25:18.695
Inspector Cho. Nothing has changed here.

368
00:25:18.695 --> 00:25:19.896
We're always like this.

369
00:25:19.965 --> 00:25:21.665
- You should go. - Okay.

370
00:25:22.066 --> 00:25:24.306
Gosh. Lieutenant Jin.

371
00:25:24.306 --> 00:25:25.306
- Yes? - Why don't you...

372
00:25:25.306 --> 00:25:27.036
go to Officer Oh?

373
00:25:27.036 --> 00:25:28.076
- Okay. - Wait up.

374
00:25:28.076 --> 00:25:29.505
Tell him I said hi.

375
00:25:29.505 --> 00:25:30.576
- Okay. - Bye.

376
00:25:30.576 --> 00:25:31.775
Say hi to him for me.

377
00:25:31.775 --> 00:25:33.505
- Okay. - For me too.

378
00:25:33.505 --> 00:25:35.816
Take care. Get those criminals.

Dad!

384
00:25:54.235 --> 00:25:56.665
Kang. Let's go home now.

385
00:25:58.005 --> 00:26:01.235
Do you really have to go camping with me?

386
00:26:01.606 --> 00:26:03.475
I hate being cold.

387
00:26:05.975 --> 00:26:08.945
Hey. Are you challenging me?

388
00:26:09.146 --> 00:26:11.386
Stop right there.

391
00:26:35.935 --> 00:26:38.846
What are you doing? It's cold. Let's go inside.

392
00:26:39.675 --> 00:26:41.116
You should get ready.

393
00:26:42.515 --> 00:26:43.576
I'm coming.

394
00:26:44.786 --> 00:26:45.816
I'm coming now.

395
00:26:48.215 --> 00:26:49.356
Let's go.

396
00:27:02.636 --> 00:27:03.765
Nice shot.

397
00:27:07.675 --> 00:27:09.376
Nice two shots.

398
00:27:09.376 --> 00:27:10.675
Stop it.

"Stop it."

400
00:27:15.715 --> 00:27:16.816
Gosh.

401
00:27:17.415 --> 00:27:20.316
Stop kicking up a fuss.

402
00:27:21.386 --> 00:27:23.616
I can't finish my business because of you.

403
00:27:24.185 --> 00:27:26.626
Hey, Pig. I told you to stay put.

404
00:27:27.495 --> 00:27:30.896
Hey, Rapist. I told you to be quiet.

405
00:27:30.925 --> 00:27:33.896
Rapist? Are you crazy?

406
00:27:34.596 --> 00:27:36.265
Don't you know who I am?

407
00:27:36.435 --> 00:27:39.235
I'm Song Gil Choon. I'm the scariest man...

There's no way it's you.

No way.

Bring it here.

- "Bring it here." - Come here.

415
00:27:58.925 --> 00:28:00.386
- "Come here." - Bring it here.

416
00:28:00.596 --> 00:28:01.596

00:28:04.896 --> 00:28:06.296
- Shouldn't you be crawling? - Hey.

420
00:28:06.296 --> 00:28:07.495
Bring it here now.

Come here, punk.

- Hey. - You punk.

424
00:28:13.435 --> 00:28:14.806
I'll count to three.

425
00:28:14.806 --> 00:28:16.606
1. 1 and a half.

426
00:28:19.275 --> 00:28:20.745
Two.

427
00:28:20.745 --> 00:28:22.376
What's with all the noise?

428
00:28:23.275 --> 00:28:25.816
Kim Jong Sam, are you ready to be released?

429
00:28:28.215 --> 00:28:29.255
Yes, sir.

430
00:28:33.955 --> 00:28:35.056
Kim Jong Sam.

431
00:28:37.465 --> 00:28:38.495
Come back again.

432
00:28:41.136 --> 00:28:43.765
He shouldn't come back. He should become a new man,

433
00:28:43.765 --> 00:28:46.235
and do something for the betterment of Korea.

434

Speak for yourself.

435

I was just wishing you well.

436
00:29:00.786 --> 00:29:02.715
"Speak for yourself."

437
00:29:04.586 --> 00:29:06.086
What did you say?

438
00:29:06.356 --> 00:29:07.995
Stop.

439
00:29:07.995 --> 00:29:10.126
Stop it.

Yes.

I almost froze to death.

446
00:29:56.675 --> 00:30:00.005
Why did you come all the way here. It's a hassle.

447
00:30:00.616 --> 00:30:01.715
Don't say that.
