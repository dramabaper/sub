00:00:05.494 --> 00:00:07.094
(Episode 10)

2
00:00:07.991 --> 00:00:09.862
I'm sorry to trouble you.

3
00:00:10.462 --> 00:00:11.862
It's not,

4
00:00:12.561 --> 00:00:14.532
but I'm not happy to show you what I want to keep hidden.

5
00:00:15.971 --> 00:00:18.572
I'll keep this a secret from Jin Joo.

6
00:00:18.572 --> 00:00:21.572
I don't care if she finds out. It will be hard for you.

7
00:00:22.241 --> 00:00:24.412
When I decided to represent In Ho,

8
00:00:25.342 --> 00:00:27.211
I prepared myself for something like this too.

9
00:00:28.252 --> 00:00:31.452
If you're prepared to get hurt, let's go in.

10
00:00:31.652 --> 00:00:32.751
Please come in.

11
00:00:37.361 --> 00:00:38.361
Ask me anything.

12
00:00:38.921 --> 00:00:42.092
I will answer everything if it can clear In Ho's name.

13
00:00:42.692 --> 00:00:44.101
Even if it's about my weaknesses.

14
00:00:45.961 --> 00:00:49.302
Why did you need a place like this?

15
00:00:51.171 --> 00:00:52.202
I...

16
00:00:53.342 --> 00:00:55.272
needed a place where my family didn't know about.

17
00:00:55.811 --> 00:00:57.541
A place I can completely be alone.

18
00:00:58.641 --> 00:00:59.811
And...

19
00:01:01.412 --> 00:01:03.351
everyone must have had their own reasons.

20
00:01:05.782 --> 00:01:07.651
Did Mi Jung come here often?

21
00:01:08.821 --> 00:01:11.091
The four of us got this place,

22
00:01:12.621 --> 00:01:15.991
but Mi Jung and In Ho did use this penthouse often.

23
00:01:23.371 --> 00:01:25.442
- Ms. Geum. - Yes?

24
00:01:25.442 --> 00:01:28.241
Why don't you go down and ask the residents...

25
00:01:28.241 --> 00:01:31.942
if they remember anything about the night...

26
00:01:31.942 --> 00:01:32.951
of the incident?

27
00:01:33.582 --> 00:01:35.011
- Okay. - Thanks.

28
00:01:46.362 --> 00:01:48.091
You're crueler than I thought you'd be.

29
00:01:48.731 --> 00:01:50.201
You brought Na Ra here.

30
00:01:53.371 --> 00:01:54.431
Would you like a drink?

31
00:01:56.772 --> 00:01:57.942
None for me.

32
00:01:58.802 --> 00:02:00.841
What's your relationship with Yum Mi Jung?

33
00:02:01.841 --> 00:02:03.082
We were just friends.

34
00:02:03.582 --> 00:02:04.782
Friends with benefits?

35
00:02:10.551 --> 00:02:13.622
You must think people should only sleep with their significant others.

36
00:02:13.951 --> 00:02:15.321
Aren't people open-minded about that these days?

37
00:02:16.261 --> 00:02:17.992
As long as there are sparks between them.

38
00:02:20.132 --> 00:02:23.532
It sounds like you were open-minded, and the sparks are strong enough...

39
00:02:24.432 --> 00:02:26.902
to open a high-end wine bar for her.

40
00:02:32.301 --> 00:02:35.041
So what is it that you want to ask me?

41
00:02:35.771 --> 00:02:38.942
Do you believe that I killed Mi Jung?

42
00:02:39.312 --> 00:02:40.912
Someone must have killed her.

43
00:02:41.912 --> 00:02:44.321
My job is to prove my client's innocence.

44
00:02:45.682 --> 00:02:47.222
You trust In Ho.

45
00:02:47.521 --> 00:02:49.421
I haven't known him for long,

46
00:02:49.421 --> 00:02:52.622
but I concluded that he's not the type to have an ulterior motive.

47
00:02:52.622 --> 00:02:55.331
Then do I seem like the type of a person who has one?

48
00:02:55.331 --> 00:02:58.701
I must experience how forthcoming you are from now on.

49
00:03:01.432 --> 00:03:02.801
Let me ask you a question now.

50
00:03:03.771 --> 00:03:07.472
Are you related to Yum Mi Jung's death in any way?

51
00:03:12.342 --> 00:03:14.152
You make jokes too.

52
00:03:14.511 --> 00:03:16.252
You still seem pretty relaxed.

53
00:03:16.622 --> 00:03:18.481
There's no reason for me not to.

54
00:03:18.481 --> 00:03:21.092
If the act was committed in this penthouse,

55
00:03:21.421 --> 00:03:22.891
the owners of this place...

56
00:03:22.891 --> 00:03:25.421
wouldn't be free from the implication of the murder.

57
00:03:27.761 --> 00:03:29.731
In Ho told you more than I thought he would.

58
00:03:32.361 --> 00:03:34.032
What else did you hear about me?

59
00:03:35.771 --> 00:03:40.041
Clients are bound to share any secrets...

60
00:03:40.171 --> 00:03:44.342
with their attorneys to prove their innocence.

61
00:03:51.551 --> 00:03:52.551
I'm coming.

62
00:03:54.122 --> 00:03:55.252
Hello.

63
00:03:56.622 --> 00:03:58.261
Is this a bad time?

64
00:03:59.462 --> 00:04:01.162
No, I was just behind the dirty dishes.

65
00:04:01.731 --> 00:04:02.761
But what is this regarding?

66
00:04:02.761 --> 00:04:06.372
Could you spare me some time if it isn't too much trouble?

67
00:04:06.771 --> 00:04:07.771
Of course.

68
00:04:08.301 --> 00:04:12.141
Were you at home on the night of November 28?

69
00:04:12.141 --> 00:04:14.171
- On November 28? - Yes.

70
00:04:14.541 --> 00:04:16.682
November 28...

71
00:04:17.882 --> 00:04:21.011
I can't remember what I did. Hold on a second.

72
00:04:21.482 --> 00:04:24.482
I think I was at work that day.

73
00:04:25.651 --> 00:04:29.321
Yes, I was. I had a night shift at work that day.

74
00:04:30.461 --> 00:04:31.661
I see.

75
00:04:32.021 --> 00:04:34.261
- Thank you for your time. - Sure.

76
00:04:34.261 --> 00:04:36.732
Okay. Bye.

77
00:04:57.521 --> 00:04:59.492
Hey, be careful with that.

78
00:04:59.492 --> 00:05:00.591
Put it there.

79
00:05:24.711 --> 00:05:26.151
- Hey. Stop it. - Hey.

80
00:05:26.151 --> 00:05:28.911
Hey, hey. Hey, Young.

81
00:05:29.052 --> 00:05:31.922
If you think about it, there isn't a person who never took a bribe.

82
00:05:31.922 --> 00:05:34.422
- He was just down on his luck. - Darn it.

83
00:05:34.951 --> 00:05:36.391
That idiot.

84
00:05:37.891 --> 00:05:39.761
Does anyone know where he lives?

85
00:05:39.761 --> 00:05:40.792
I don't.

86
00:05:41.331 --> 00:05:42.331
Do you?

87
00:05:44.031 --> 00:05:45.062
Then where does he hang out?

88
00:05:45.531 --> 00:05:46.571
I don't know.

89
00:05:48.232 --> 00:05:51.502
How could nobody know where their colleague lives?

90
00:05:51.641 --> 00:05:52.701
This is ridiculous!

91
00:05:52.872 --> 00:05:53.911
What about you?

92
00:05:54.341 --> 00:05:56.641
You were close with him for years. What have you done?

93
00:05:58.112 --> 00:05:59.112
Follow me.

94
00:06:01.682 --> 00:06:04.521
Did you really not know what Dong Bae was doing?

95
00:06:04.882 --> 00:06:05.922
I didn't.

96
00:06:05.922 --> 00:06:07.992
True. If you had known with that temper of yours,

97
00:06:08.821 --> 00:06:11.891
you would've put that punk in his place long ago.

98
00:06:12.692 --> 00:06:13.692
What do you want to do?

99
00:06:14.492 --> 00:06:16.701
I'll meet with him first...

100
00:06:16.701 --> 00:06:20.632
In the past, I could've buried it and said it's just common practice,

101
00:06:21.602 --> 00:06:22.872
but not anymore.

102
00:06:23.742 --> 00:06:25.742
It's a big deal now.

103
00:06:26.942 --> 00:06:27.971
I know.

104
00:06:28.312 --> 00:06:29.411
This is Dong Bae's personal file.

105
00:06:29.882 --> 00:06:31.211
Find him somehow,

106
00:06:31.411 --> 00:06:34.211
and just bring him here even if you break his bones or buy him drinks.

107
00:06:35.852 --> 00:06:36.882
Thanks.

108
00:06:37.682 --> 00:06:40.792
Gosh. Get lost. Scram.

109
00:06:41.221 --> 00:06:44.922
You kids are making my hair turn white.

110
00:06:58.341 --> 00:06:59.372
Is anyone home?

111
00:07:07.211 --> 00:07:08.651
Excuse me.

112
00:07:09.922 --> 00:07:11.182
Is anyone home?

113
00:07:12.521 --> 00:07:13.752
Is anybody here?

114
00:07:14.451 --> 00:07:15.721
Excuse me!

115
00:07:16.492 --> 00:07:17.792
Who is it?

116
00:07:17.891 --> 00:07:20.932
Hello. Are you Dong Bae's...

117
00:07:21.292 --> 00:07:22.692
mother?

118
00:07:25.802 --> 00:07:26.802
Oh, my.

119
00:07:29.641 --> 00:07:31.502
Hello, ma'am.

120
00:07:31.942 --> 00:07:33.511
I'm Dong Bae's colleague...

121
00:07:36.382 --> 00:07:37.382
I'm his colleague.

122
00:07:38.211 --> 00:07:40.411
Did something happen to Dong Bae?

123
00:07:40.482 --> 00:07:43.922
I just wanted to say hi. I should've come by sooner.

124
00:07:43.922 --> 00:07:44.922
I'm sorry.

125
00:07:45.651 --> 00:07:46.651
Not at all.

126
00:07:47.891 --> 00:07:50.521
Is he doing his job well? Isn't he a nuisance?

127
00:07:50.521 --> 00:07:54.632
Not at all. He is hardworking and polite,

128
00:07:54.961 --> 00:07:56.502
so everyone likes him.

129
00:07:58.031 --> 00:08:01.432
My gosh. Where's my head? Please come inside.

130
00:08:02.031 --> 00:08:05.841
I may be like this due to complications from diabetes,

131
00:08:05.841 --> 00:08:06.911
but I should be a good host.

132
00:08:07.141 --> 00:08:09.482
Thank you. Excuse me.

133
00:08:09.482 --> 00:08:10.511
Sure.

134
00:08:18.521 --> 00:08:21.492
Dong Bae keeps his room clean, doesn't he?

135
00:08:21.891 --> 00:08:22.922
What do you mean?

136
00:08:23.692 --> 00:08:27.161
He doesn't even put away the blanket when he gets up.

137
00:08:27.692 --> 00:08:31.732
I'm always afraid he's just as messy when he's out too.

138
00:08:32.602 --> 00:08:35.572
Then do you clean for him every day?

139
00:08:36.072 --> 00:08:38.372
I should give him a good scolding.

140
00:08:39.842 --> 00:08:41.771
He doesn't live here.

141
00:08:42.311 --> 00:08:46.151
He only comes to visit me every so often.

142
00:08:47.681 --> 00:08:49.551
- I'll take that. - It's okay.

143
00:08:50.852 --> 00:08:53.722
I just sweep and mop the room. That's all.

144
00:08:53.752 --> 00:08:55.492
Okay. I see.

145
00:08:56.592 --> 00:09:00.031
That's right. Is his uncle doing better?

146
00:09:00.061 --> 00:09:01.462
Whose uncle?

147
00:09:04.702 --> 00:09:06.502
I must've been mistaken.

148
00:09:08.332 --> 00:09:10.271
How much can I believe him?

149
00:09:10.441 --> 00:09:12.541
Here. Drink this.

150
00:09:12.842 --> 00:09:14.972
- Sure. Thank you. - No problem.

151
00:09:19.651 --> 00:09:22.311
Why did you keep the gate unlocked?

152
00:09:22.582 --> 00:09:23.722
It broke.

153
00:09:24.681 --> 00:09:27.222
Dong Bae said he'd fix it, but...

154
00:09:38.732 --> 00:09:40.732
I'm sorry for troubling you.

155
00:09:40.832 --> 00:09:44.572
Have you ever visited where Dong Bae lives?

156
00:09:44.901 --> 00:09:46.842
No, not yet.

157
00:09:47.372 --> 00:09:49.781
As you can see, given my condition...

158
00:09:50.141 --> 00:09:53.311
Then you must not know where he lives either.

159
00:09:53.411 --> 00:09:55.051
I know where he lives.

160
00:09:57.122 --> 00:09:58.122
That's a relief.

161
00:10:32.021 --> 00:10:33.051
Was that a bell?

162
00:10:47.931 --> 00:10:48.931
Hello?

163
00:10:49.941 --> 00:10:51.441
Were you sleeping?

164
00:10:51.742 --> 00:10:52.742
Talk.

165
00:10:52.842 --> 00:10:53.872
The train.

166
00:10:54.872 --> 00:10:56.641
What do you mean? Explain.

167
00:10:56.941 --> 00:10:59.482
Can you come to the office now?

168
00:10:59.651 --> 00:11:00.712
I'm in the office now.

169
00:11:13.332 --> 00:11:15.232
It's a train crossing gate.

170
00:11:15.632 --> 00:11:16.931
Listen to this.

171
00:11:23.242 --> 00:11:26.311
My grandmother used to live near a train track,

172
00:11:26.311 --> 00:11:28.811
and I heard this sound whenever the gate came down.

173
00:11:28.941 --> 00:11:32.752
Let's look for a Baikal teal habitat...

174
00:11:33.212 --> 00:11:34.212
near a train crossing.

175
00:11:34.212 --> 00:11:36.421
(Korean Palace)

176
00:11:52.161 --> 00:11:55.002
Don't you have something to say to me?

177
00:12:18.061 --> 00:12:22.661
What idiot just runs without knowing if there is a way out?

178
00:12:23.531 --> 00:12:26.232
Do I need to teach you everything from scratch?

179
00:12:26.232 --> 00:12:27.472
Don't come any closer!

180
00:12:27.502 --> 00:12:29.372
Fine. I won't go closer,

181
00:12:30.502 --> 00:12:31.502
so tell me.

182
00:12:32.441 --> 00:12:34.742
You must've had a reason...

183
00:12:35.112 --> 00:12:36.842
for doing something this huge.

184
00:12:37.112 --> 00:12:38.712
You won't believe me anyway.

185
00:12:38.712 --> 00:12:41.511
Why does it matter whether I believe you or not?

186
00:12:41.511 --> 00:12:42.551
It matters to me!

187
00:12:43.882 --> 00:12:45.521
I'm fine as long as you believe me.

188
00:12:45.521 --> 00:12:47.322
Don't give me that garbage.

189
00:12:48.421 --> 00:12:49.421
What's your deal?

190
00:12:51.222 --> 00:12:53.962
I didn't try to kill Seo Joon Hee!

191
00:12:53.962 --> 00:12:54.962
I know.

192
00:12:55.661 --> 00:12:58.531
You didn't even know what that badge was.

193
00:12:58.531 --> 00:12:59.671
I know, so tell me.

194
00:13:00.102 --> 00:13:03.372
How, and how deep are you involved with Seo Joon Hee's case?

195
00:13:04.972 --> 00:13:09.212
I... I just... Darn it.

196
00:13:10.212 --> 00:13:11.382
Tell me.

197
00:13:11.681 --> 00:13:15.212
I can't tell you. If I do, I'm dead.

198
00:13:15.212 --> 00:13:16.452
Darn it.

199
00:13:17.752 --> 00:13:19.622
At least tell me where Seo Joon Hee is.

200
00:13:19.622 --> 00:13:21.722
Don't come any closer! I'll jump.

201
00:13:21.722 --> 00:13:24.891
Don't make me laugh. If I catch you, you're dead.

202
00:13:24.891 --> 00:13:25.992
Come here while I'm being nice.

203
00:13:27.661 --> 00:13:28.691
You won't come?

204
00:13:29.291 --> 00:13:30.401
You won't come?

205
00:13:30.661 --> 00:13:32.202
You crazy fool.

206
00:13:33.771 --> 00:13:34.771
Dong Bae!

207
00:13:39.202 --> 00:13:42.742
Dong Bae. Why are you doing this to me?

208
00:13:56.891 --> 00:13:57.921
Okay.

209
00:14:00.791 --> 00:14:01.791
Okay.

210
00:14:08.972 --> 00:14:10.401
It smells like an old bachelor.

211
00:14:21.112 --> 00:14:22.651
This is so troublesome.

Woo Suk, Sunshine Nursing Home.

There's a Baikal teal habitat by the train crossing in Buseok.

215
00:15:35.352 --> 00:15:37.362
We'll stop for 15 minutes.

216
00:15:39.992 --> 00:15:42.362
I can't even drive because of the injury.

217
00:16:14.092 --> 00:16:16.602
Don't lose him. Stay on his heels.

218
00:16:16.962 --> 00:16:19.362
Call me when you can. Okay.

219
00:16:20.972 --> 00:16:23.572
- Where is he? - On West Coast Highway.

220
00:16:24.771 --> 00:16:27.411
But why are we tailing the detective?

221
00:16:29.612 --> 00:16:30.612
Joon Hee...

222
00:16:32.752 --> 00:16:34.051
might be alive.

223
00:16:35.852 --> 00:16:37.852
Joon Hee is alive?

224
00:16:37.952 --> 00:16:39.791
There's a possibility.

225
00:16:49.291 --> 00:16:50.362
Then...

226
00:16:51.632 --> 00:16:52.632
it means...

227
00:16:54.671 --> 00:16:55.671
I didn't...

228
00:16:57.171 --> 00:16:58.641
kill Joon Hee.

229
00:17:17.292 --> 00:17:18.691
Thank you.

230
00:17:21.062 --> 00:17:22.362
Thank you.

231
00:17:25.501 --> 00:17:26.832
Thank you.

232
00:17:43.822 --> 00:17:44.882
Hey.

233
00:17:46.822 --> 00:17:48.092
Darn you.

234
00:17:52.092 --> 00:17:53.132
Hey.

235
00:17:54.592 --> 00:17:57.401
Even though you knew that Joon Hee was alive,

236
00:17:59.431 --> 00:18:01.332
you made us push him off the cliff?

237
00:18:05.102 --> 00:18:07.072
You are the one who killed Joon Hee.

238
00:18:07.812 --> 00:18:10.512
You are really a piece of trash.

239
00:18:10.941 --> 00:18:13.782
Hey, Oh Tae Suk.

240
00:18:14.382 --> 00:18:16.552
You're the one who killed Joon Hee.

241
00:18:16.552 --> 00:18:19.221
You're the murderer. You killed Joon Hee.

242
00:18:28.191 --> 00:18:29.231
I'm...

243
00:18:30.762 --> 00:18:33.302
going to Joon Hee. I'm going to go see him.

244
00:18:35.471 --> 00:18:36.501
Did you...

245
00:18:37.141 --> 00:18:40.312
order Mr. Kim to follow the detective...

246
00:18:42.882 --> 00:18:44.812
because you wanted to find Joon Hee?

247
00:18:46.312 --> 00:18:50.122
We must find Joon Hee before he does.

248
00:18:50.552 --> 00:18:52.681
Why is that important now?

249
00:18:54.352 --> 00:18:55.592
He's alive.

250
00:18:58.122 --> 00:18:59.292
Did you forget...

251
00:19:00.092 --> 00:19:01.592
what we did to Joon Hee?

252
00:19:05.532 --> 00:19:06.802
- No, I can't do this. - Joon Hee!

253
00:19:17.812 --> 00:19:18.911
Do you seriously not see...

254
00:19:20.082 --> 00:19:22.181
the problem of this situation we are in?

255
00:19:22.312 --> 00:19:24.522
- What is the problem? - Someone...

256
00:19:25.782 --> 00:19:28.491
switched Joon Hee's body with someone else's.

257
00:19:30.092 --> 00:19:31.862
My gosh, shoot.

258
00:19:36.231 --> 00:19:38.661
- Who? - At first,

259
00:19:40.001 --> 00:19:43.141
I thought someone from our gang, including In Ho, killed Mi Jung.

260
00:19:43.701 --> 00:19:45.171
That's why I decided to bury her.

261
00:19:47.211 --> 00:19:48.241
But what happened next?

262
00:19:48.842 --> 00:19:52.012
The body we buried in the quarry was found in the middle of a road.

263
00:19:53.812 --> 00:19:55.681
So what you're saying...

264
00:19:57.681 --> 00:19:59.122
is that someone...

265
00:19:59.852 --> 00:20:02.122
is watching what we've been doing.

266
00:20:02.322 --> 00:20:03.891
It's more than that.

267
00:20:05.092 --> 00:20:06.362
That person...

268
00:20:07.491 --> 00:20:08.991
is cornering us.

269
00:20:09.661 --> 00:20:10.762
Why?

270
00:20:11.501 --> 00:20:12.661
Why?

271
00:20:13.431 --> 00:20:14.971
What have we done wrong?

272
00:20:16.372 --> 00:20:18.701
You got rid of the memory card in the dash cam, right?

273
00:20:20.012 --> 00:20:21.171
No, that...

274
00:20:26.181 --> 00:20:27.681
What about the history in your GPS?

275
00:20:27.681 --> 00:20:30.022
Why? Was I supposed to delete that too?

276
00:20:30.022 --> 00:20:31.451
Seriously.

277
00:20:35.122 --> 00:20:39.661
You crazy jerk. Do you want to sell the car with the history?

278
00:20:40.132 --> 00:20:42.391
Let me check on it now. You little...

279
00:20:44.062 --> 00:20:46.501
I'm sure it's not sold yet. It has not been long on the market.

280
00:20:48.332 --> 00:20:50.201
I said I'll check on it.

281
00:21:01.512 --> 00:21:03.522
Hey, did you sell my car?

282
00:21:03.751 --> 00:21:06.322
It's not that easy to sell.

283
00:21:06.691 --> 00:21:09.052
Who would buy such an expensive car that quickly?

284
00:21:09.391 --> 00:21:12.062
I'm not selling the dash cam and the GPS. Take them out from my car.

285
00:21:12.062 --> 00:21:13.292
I'll pick them up.

286
00:21:14.532 --> 00:21:16.461
No, let me drop them off.

287
00:21:16.461 --> 00:21:18.231
I need to bring back that car you took anyway.

288
00:21:18.461 --> 00:21:19.572
Could you do that then?

289
00:21:20.701 --> 00:21:21.701
Okay.

290
00:21:32.282 --> 00:21:34.312
What an annoying jerk.

291
00:21:34.681 --> 00:21:35.951
He's filthy rich.

292
00:21:35.951 --> 00:21:39.282
Why does he want to take back the dash cam and the GPS?

293
00:21:42.651 --> 00:21:45.191
Let me take them out now.

294
00:21:48.132 --> 00:21:50.102
Rachel from the wine bar is dead.

295
00:21:50.102 --> 00:21:52.032
I don't know the details either.

296
00:21:52.032 --> 00:21:54.501
I only know that he fell off a cliff in Gangwon Province.

297
00:21:54.971 --> 00:21:57.842
You know there was a rumor that something was going on...

298
00:21:58.042 --> 00:22:00.312
between Rachel and the four of them.

299
00:22:00.572 --> 00:22:04.012
So rumors say they killed each other over Rachel too.

300
00:22:04.241 --> 00:22:06.812
He said a cliff in Gangwon Province.

301

303
00:22:19.532 --> 00:22:22.461
Hey, it's me. Remember the birthday party the other day?

304
00:22:24.001 --> 00:22:26.332
Did Kim Hak Bum come to the club?

305
00:22:26.671 --> 00:22:28.471
Did you not see him or did he not come?

306
00:22:29.941 --> 00:22:31.241
You're not sure if he came or not,

307
00:22:31.542 --> 00:22:33.342
but you don't remember seeing him?

308
00:22:34.372 --> 00:22:35.512
Even me?

309
00:22:40.251 --> 00:22:41.352
What's up with this jerk?

310
00:22:42.711 --> 00:22:43.921
Why did he lie?

311
00:22:45.451 --> 00:22:48.122
He said he won't sell the dash cam either.

313
00:22:55.191 --> 00:22:57.062
What's this? What's going on?

314
00:22:57.901 --> 00:23:00.532
He deleted the video for December 3?

315
00:23:01.931 --> 00:23:05.941
Look at this. I smell something awful.

316
00:23:06.512 --> 00:23:10.342
It's not just awful. It's reeking. Seriously.

317
00:23:11.981 --> 00:23:13.082
Hey, my friend.

318

1,6510,000 millionaires in this world.

Why are you talking about millionaires out of the blue?

323
00:23:30.961 --> 00:23:32.001
Who knows?

324
00:23:33.832 --> 00:23:37.342
I might be able to become 1 of 28,000 millionaires...

325

in Korea overnight.

326

My gosh, forget about having a million dollars.

327
00:23:42.671 --> 00:23:45.082
I hope I can pay back my debt.

328
00:23:45.082 --> 00:23:47.681
Hey, how much is your debt?

329
00:23:48.211 --> 00:23:51.522
Was it 18,000 dollars? Wait a minute.

330
00:23:53.691 --> 00:23:56.322
You just wait. Who knows?

331
00:23:58.562 --> 00:24:01.332
I might be able to pay off your debt.

332
00:24:01.332 --> 00:24:04.461
Wait, it sounds like you are really onto something.

333

Since this client of mine...

00:24:06.772 --> 00:24:10.542
is a professor at a theological college, he's no small-timer.

335
00:24:10.542 --> 00:24:11.701
He's truly incredible.

336
00:24:12.342 --> 00:24:15.072
He has bestowed upon me a blessing.

337
00:24:15.872 --> 00:24:18.812
- Thank you. - Try to make some sense at least.

338
00:24:20.112 --> 00:24:22.181
That's not right. That's not right.

339
00:24:22.552 --> 00:24:23.951
Not now.

340
00:24:25.921 --> 00:24:28.421
I have risked my life for this project.

341
00:24:29.022 --> 00:24:30.562
If I tell you now, I'll face retribution.

342
00:24:38.832 --> 00:24:39.832
Shot.

345
00:25:04.022 --> 00:25:06.092
All right. Hello.

346
00:25:06.532 --> 00:25:07.562
Hi.

347
00:25:09.191 --> 00:25:10.532
Where to, sir?

348
00:25:11.231 --> 00:25:14.032
- Go straight for now, sir. - Okay.

349
00:25:27.911 --> 00:25:30.322
- Make a U-turn over there. - Sure.

350
00:25:37.862 --> 00:25:39.161
Look at this punk.

351
00:26:05.181 --> 00:26:06.852
Where are you right now?

352
00:26:07.421 --> 00:26:09.022
At a Baikal teal habitat.

353
00:26:09.592 --> 00:26:12.362
I thought I should start from here.

354
00:26:13.862 --> 00:26:15.862
I'll call if I find anything new.

355
00:26:16.231 --> 00:26:17.501
Okay. Thanks.

356
00:26:17.661 --> 00:26:18.661
Okay.

359
00:28:18.622 --> 00:28:19.751
Ms. Choi?

360
00:28:20.651 --> 00:28:21.921
Why are you here?

361
00:28:25.362 --> 00:28:26.362
What...

362
00:28:28.062 --> 00:28:29.062
is your deal?

363
00:28:53.122 --> 00:28:54.921
(Return)

364
00:28:57.491 --> 00:28:58.891
You should've taken good care of it.

365
00:28:58.891 --> 00:29:00.161
Who are you?

366
00:29:00.161 --> 00:29:02.132
I like the look in your eyes.

367
00:29:02.132 --> 00:29:04.201
Should we just let him threaten us?

368
00:29:04.201 --> 00:29:05.602
Check on Joon Hee first.

369
00:29:05.602 --> 00:29:07.372
Leave Joon Hee alone.

370
00:29:07.532 --> 00:29:10.372
What? Have you punks lost your mind? Who gave you orders?

371
00:29:10.372 --> 00:29:12.201
Ma'am! Are you inside?

372
00:29:12.201 --> 00:29:14.072
Two million in cash, right?

373
00:29:14.072 --> 00:29:16.782
Where did things go wrong?

374
00:29:16.782 --> 00:29:19.552
I know. What could the killer be after?
