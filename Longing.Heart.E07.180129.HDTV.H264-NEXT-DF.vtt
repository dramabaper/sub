3
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.357
Ms. Lee.

4
00:01:01.294 --> 00:01:03.497
To be honest, I think that...

5
00:01:04.184 --> 00:01:06.333
I haven't forgotten
anything, either.

6
00:01:09.574 --> 00:01:11.253
So...

7
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.919
I don't think it'd be right of me
to hold onto this any longer.

8
00:01:18.496 --> 00:01:20.750
I'm sorry...

9
00:01:21.368 --> 00:01:23.093
that I'm returning this to you so late.

10
00:02:23.394 --> 00:02:24.619
Here.

11
00:02:34.858 --> 00:02:36.518
I'm sorry.

12
00:02:38.095 --> 00:02:40.277
It's just that you look
so much like my friend.

13
00:02:50.322 --> 00:02:52.137
It's raining.

14
00:03:16.983 --> 00:03:18.769
We're here.

15
00:03:19.901 --> 00:03:21.936
It's that hospital
over there.

16
00:03:23.537 --> 00:03:25.716
Why... are we at the hospital?

17
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.418
That's where I work.
I'm a doctor, you see.

18
00:03:30.418 --> 00:03:31.758
A doctor.

19
00:03:32.475 --> 00:03:33.870
That suits you well.

20
00:03:35.175 --> 00:03:37.357
They've even built
a hospital here now.

21
00:03:37.357 --> 00:03:39.633
This place sure has changed a lot.

22
00:03:40.274 --> 00:03:42.226
Is this the first time in a while
that you've come here?

23
00:03:42.226 --> 00:03:43.899
It's been ten years.

24
00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:45.911
Ten... years?

25
00:03:45.911 --> 00:03:49.188
I lived here briefly
when I was in high school

26
00:03:49.188 --> 00:03:52.134
but this is the first time I came
back after I left to study abroad.

27
00:03:57.531 --> 00:03:59.501
Yes, Senior?

28
00:03:59.501 --> 00:04:01.334
I'm in front of the hospital.

29
00:04:01.334 --> 00:04:05.131
<i>So she did end up leaving to study
abroad back then, after all?</i>

30
00:04:05.131 --> 00:04:06.606
Senior.

31
00:04:10.237 --> 00:04:12.732
Why did you come out here
when I told you that I'm already here?

32
00:04:12.732 --> 00:04:15.025
I've been waiting outside
since it started raining.

33
00:04:16.595 --> 00:04:18.126
Who's this?

34
00:04:18.126 --> 00:04:20.729
Well... um...

35
00:04:21.773 --> 00:04:24.448
He shared his umbrella with me
since it was raining.

36
00:04:24.448 --> 00:04:25.821
Oh.

37
00:04:29.886 --> 00:04:31.571
Where have you been?

38
00:04:31.571 --> 00:04:33.876
Did you meet up with your friends
from back in high school, or something?

39
00:04:36.431 --> 00:04:40.479
I haven't talked to any of them
in the past ten years, after all.

40
00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:42.590
What about that friend
from back at the hospital?

41
00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.886
That was the first time that I'd seen
Shin Woo in ten years, too.

42
00:04:50.119 --> 00:04:52.655
Thank you for the umbrella.

43
00:04:53.405 --> 00:04:54.765
Sure.

44
00:05:03.152 --> 00:05:05.162
<i>We have no time, Marty.
We're on a tight schedule, here.</i>

45
00:05:05.162 --> 00:05:06.251
<i>Tell me about my future.</i>

46
00:05:06.251 --> 00:05:08.544
<i>I mean, I know I make it big,
but what do I...</i>

47
00:05:08.544 --> 00:05:10.469
Oh, hey!
You're back?

48
00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:11.965
You know, I thought about it

49
00:05:11.965 --> 00:05:14.657
and I think we need to try
near a body of water.

50
00:05:15.945 --> 00:05:17.693
I'm talking about you
returning to the past!

51
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.441
Where should we go first?

52
00:05:19.441 --> 00:05:20.551
The ocean?

53
00:05:21.236 --> 00:05:22.253
Firefly Bridge!

54
00:05:22.253 --> 00:05:23.811
I'm not going back.

55
00:05:23.811 --> 00:05:24.811
What?

56
00:05:24.811 --> 00:05:26.400
I said, I'm not going back!

57
00:05:32.616 --> 00:05:34.609
Hey, what are you talking about?

58
00:05:34.609 --> 00:05:37.840
You said you were going back, so how
could you change your mind now?

59
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.777
You were the one who lied first!

60
00:05:39.777 --> 00:05:41.751
- About what?
- You said things were going well.

61
00:05:41.751 --> 00:05:43.477
Oh.

62
00:05:43.477 --> 00:05:45.672
So you call falling out of touch with
someone for ten years "doing well?"

63
00:05:45.672 --> 00:05:46.696
And another thing!

64
00:05:46.696 --> 00:05:49.232
Why didn't you tell me that Ji Soo
would be leaving to study abroad

65
00:05:49.232 --> 00:05:50.522
when I go back?

66
00:05:50.522 --> 00:05:51.563
Who said that, huh? Who?

67
00:05:51.563 --> 00:05:52.763
Ji Soo did!

68
00:05:52.763 --> 00:05:54.246
She said it with her own mouth!

69
00:05:54.246 --> 00:05:56.729
You... met with Ji Soo?

70
00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:58.686
Ji Soo is here right now?

71
00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:01.671
Hey! Hey, wake up!

72
00:06:01.671 --> 00:06:02.909
Ji Soo didn't recognize you?

73
00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:04.222
Ji Soo didn't say anything?

74
00:06:04.222 --> 00:06:05.640
Huh? Hey!

75
00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.304
Ugh, damn it!

76
00:06:23.391 --> 00:06:24.994
Um...

77
00:06:25.681 --> 00:06:28.962
what's your name,
by the way?

78
00:06:32.212 --> 00:06:33.712
Later.

79
00:06:35.198 --> 00:06:37.287
I'll tell you later.

80
00:06:39.825 --> 00:06:42.068
How is it that he looks
so much like him?

81
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.136
Do you think I'll change my mind
because you made this?

82
00:07:19.136 --> 00:07:22.015
- Don't eat, then.
- Hey, whoa.

83
00:07:23.576 --> 00:07:25.162
Hey.

84
00:07:25.162 --> 00:07:28.013
What are you even going to do here,
if you don't go back?

85
00:07:28.013 --> 00:07:29.578
I never said that I was
going to do anything.

86
00:07:29.578 --> 00:07:32.450
I just... need some time.

87
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:35.335
I'm sick of being separated from people
when I haven't prepared myself for it

88
00:07:35.335 --> 00:07:37.975
and not being able to
see people ever again.

89
00:07:37.975 --> 00:07:39.828
At the very least...

90
00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.035
I can see Ji Soo here.

91
00:07:42.664 --> 00:07:44.719
Even if she's 28 years old now.

92
00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:49.705
Wow.

93
00:07:49.705 --> 00:07:51.515
Oh wow, I almost said yes!

94
00:07:51.515 --> 00:07:52.720
No, no, no.

95
00:07:53.297 --> 00:07:54.323
Hey, Kang Shin Woo.

96
00:07:54.323 --> 00:07:56.350
Let's think about this
logically for a second.

97
00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:57.419
What do you mean?

98
00:07:57.419 --> 00:07:59.989
The reason Ji Soo didn't recognize you
was because you got lucky.

99
00:07:59.989 --> 00:08:01.635
I came from the future.

100
00:08:01.635 --> 00:08:03.962
But you came from the past, so all
of our friends will recognize you.

101
00:08:03.962 --> 00:08:05.876
Think about Geun Deok,
Min Seok, and So Ra!

102
00:08:05.876 --> 00:08:09.032
How will you explain this when you
run into them, huh?

103
00:08:09.032 --> 00:08:10.157
But, Teach.

104
00:08:10.157 --> 00:08:14.427
If you suddenly saw a kid who looks just
like Min Seok when he was in high school

105
00:08:14.427 --> 00:08:15.984
what would you think?

106
00:08:17.436 --> 00:08:18.982
Hm.

107
00:08:18.982 --> 00:08:20.763
Maybe he's a relative of his?

108
00:08:20.763 --> 00:08:24.403
A time slip, versus a relative
who has a strong resemblance.

109
00:08:24.403 --> 00:08:27.359
Which one of those two
seem to be more probable?

110
00:08:27.359 --> 00:08:28.465
Logically.

111
00:08:28.465 --> 00:08:31.670
Hm. The relative thing would
probably be more logical.

112
00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:32.805
It's settled, then.

113
00:08:32.805 --> 00:08:33.902
Let's pretend that
we're relatives.

114
00:08:33.902 --> 00:08:35.004
Hey!

115
00:08:35.004 --> 00:08:37.954
If you're going to keep doing things
the way you want to

116
00:08:37.954 --> 00:08:39.032
then get out of here!

117
00:08:39.032 --> 00:08:40.735
Go be homeless in
front of Ji Soo's hospital

118
00:08:40.735 --> 00:08:43.340
or live a reckless life on the streets!
Do whatever you want!

119
00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:44.461
Mr. Kang.

120
00:08:44.461 --> 00:08:46.874
I don't think we've quite established
the state you're in right now.

121
00:08:47.671 --> 00:08:51.697
You're not exactly in the position
to be threatening me right now.

122
00:08:51.697 --> 00:08:54.034
- What?
- I'm your past self.

123
00:08:54.034 --> 00:08:58.278
So if I live a reckless life, what do
you think will happen to your life?

124
00:08:59.162 --> 00:09:01.787
Do you really want me to
live a reckless life?

125
00:09:05.538 --> 00:09:07.122
Ugh!

126
00:09:07.931 --> 00:09:09.306
That little...

127
00:09:12.031 --> 00:09:14.213
Is he a genius?

128
00:09:14.884 --> 00:09:16.388
Ugh.

129
00:09:16.388 --> 00:09:19.422
Jeez, how did he get so smart?

130
00:09:20.797 --> 00:09:23.086
Seriously though,
what do I do about him?

131
00:09:31.646 --> 00:09:33.565
What do you use to shave?

132
00:09:35.018 --> 00:09:36.267
This.

133
00:09:36.762 --> 00:09:38.971
You can wash your face with
this and shave with it.

134
00:09:38.971 --> 00:09:43.456
Wow, you can do both?
2017 sure is awesome.

135
00:09:47.297 --> 00:09:48.558
I'll give it to you.

136
00:09:48.558 --> 00:09:52.176
I'll give you 10 boxes,
no, 100 boxes!

137
00:09:52.859 --> 00:09:55.330
Take it all, and go back, okay?

138
00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:56.777
I can just use it here.

139
00:09:56.777 --> 00:09:57.957
Ugh!

140
00:09:58.816 --> 00:10:01.219
Wow, 2017!

141
00:10:05.481 --> 00:10:07.093
Why are you doing this?

142
00:10:07.093 --> 00:10:08.114
So this isn't enough, huh?

143
00:10:08.114 --> 00:10:09.993
Should I just drown you in the tub?

144
00:10:09.993 --> 00:10:12.766
Ugh, seriously!

145
00:10:21.192 --> 00:10:23.186
Hey, Kang Shin Woo!

146
00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:25.825
- Kang Shin Woo!
- It's So Ra.

147
00:10:25.825 --> 00:10:27.547
So Ra?

148
00:10:28.391 --> 00:10:30.499
Don't move a muscle, and stay here!

149
00:10:30.499 --> 00:10:31.590
And don't come out, no matter what!

150
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:34.598
Why not? I'm curious to see
how our friends are doing.

151
00:10:34.598 --> 00:10:35.937
You can just say that
I'm your relative.

152
00:10:35.937 --> 00:10:37.021
Hey!

153
00:10:37.021 --> 00:10:39.043
Don't you know that Jang So Ra
has amazingly sharp eyes?

154
00:10:39.043 --> 00:10:41.835
Shut your mouth and
stay in here, got it?

155
00:10:44.365 --> 00:10:46.013
Jeez!

156
00:10:52.191 --> 00:10:54.446
Did you fight with Min Seok again?

157
00:10:54.446 --> 00:10:55.517
Hey.

158
00:10:55.517 --> 00:10:56.532
Have you been able to contact

159
00:10:56.532 --> 00:10:57.699
our homeroom teacher from
our second year in high school?

160
00:10:57.699 --> 00:11:01.402
W-why are you asking about
him all of the sudden?

161
00:11:01.402 --> 00:11:03.277
Why did he have to say such
nonsensical things

162
00:11:03.277 --> 00:11:05.306
to Kim Min Seok back then,
and give him false hopes?

163
00:11:05.306 --> 00:11:06.329
What?

164
00:11:06.329 --> 00:11:08.319
Kim Min Seok said that
he's quitting his job.

165
00:11:08.319 --> 00:11:11.307
He said that he wants to
start drawing again.

166
00:11:11.307 --> 00:11:12.461
So?

167
00:11:12.461 --> 00:11:14.137
What do you mean, "so?"

168
00:11:14.137 --> 00:11:16.672
I told him to sign divorce papers while
writing his letter of resignation, too.

169
00:11:17.172 --> 00:11:20.747
So Ra and Min Seok... got married?

170
00:11:22.901 --> 00:11:26.221
Just see what happens if I run into
that homeroom teacher again.

171
00:11:26.221 --> 00:11:28.680
If I get a divorce,
it's all that teacher's fault.

172
00:11:30.492 --> 00:11:32.008
I'm sorry.

173
00:11:32.008 --> 00:11:33.532
It's not like I was the only one who
was involved in creating our kid.

174
00:11:33.532 --> 00:11:35.128
Does he think that things are
only hard for him?

175
00:11:35.128 --> 00:11:37.984
"His dream"?
What a crock of shit.

176
00:11:37.984 --> 00:11:39.845
He's not the only one who
had to give up on his dreams.

177
00:11:39.845 --> 00:11:44.029
Do you think I'm living like this in the
prime of my youth because I want to?

178
00:11:44.811 --> 00:11:48.569
I guess that sex-ed
wasn't very effective.

179
00:11:50.194 --> 00:11:52.281
But, hey.

180
00:11:52.281 --> 00:11:54.065
Don't you remember
that teacher telling you two

181
00:11:54.065 --> 00:11:57.459
to resolve your fights among
yourselves, back then?

182
00:11:57.459 --> 00:11:58.643
What?

183
00:11:59.878 --> 00:12:01.051
Nothing.

184
00:12:04.301 --> 00:12:05.516
Oh, yeah.

185
00:12:05.516 --> 00:12:08.037
Geun Deok said he's done shooting
his movie, so he's coming here.

186
00:12:08.037 --> 00:12:10.142
I think he's going to be staying here
while he takes a break.

187
00:12:10.142 --> 00:12:11.213
Oh.

188
00:12:11.213 --> 00:12:13.437
Geun Deok was shooting a movie?

189
00:12:14.305 --> 00:12:15.849
Did he become a celebrity?

190
00:12:15.849 --> 00:12:19.502
So, we planned to all meet up tomorrow.

191
00:12:19.502 --> 00:12:21.010
Do you have time tomorrow?

192
00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:23.571
Yeah, I have time.

193
00:12:24.524 --> 00:12:26.721
But, is it okay if I invite
one more person?

194
00:12:26.721 --> 00:12:27.783
Who?

195
00:12:27.783 --> 00:12:31.099
If that person agrees to come,
then I'll tell you.

196
00:12:31.099 --> 00:12:32.398
Sure.

197
00:12:33.295 --> 00:12:36.588
I'll be going now. I have to go pick up
my second eldest kid.

198
00:12:39.773 --> 00:12:41.440
Hey, Jang So Ra.

199
00:12:42.167 --> 00:12:43.191
Yeah?

200
00:12:43.191 --> 00:12:44.788
You're still pretty.

201
00:12:44.788 --> 00:12:46.806
Are you trying to pick a
fight with me, right now?

202
00:12:46.806 --> 00:12:49.965
You looked like you were sparkling even
when you only had a school uniform on.

203
00:12:49.965 --> 00:12:52.042
And you're the same now.

204
00:12:52.846 --> 00:12:55.213
My friend, Jang So Ra,
isn't going anywhere!

205
00:12:55.213 --> 00:12:57.499
She looks pretty,
even with just a t-shirt on.

206
00:12:57.499 --> 00:12:58.825
Just like you were back then.

207
00:13:00.187 --> 00:13:01.820
I mean, seriously...

208
00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:04.168
Oh no.

209
00:13:04.168 --> 00:13:06.057
Hey, I'm going to use your bathroom.

210
00:13:06.057 --> 00:13:07.061
Huh?

211
00:13:08.191 --> 00:13:10.402
Um, wait!
Just a second!

212
00:13:14.274 --> 00:13:15.700
Hey!

213
00:13:16.245 --> 00:13:18.901
I told you not to
crawl out of there, didn't I?

214
00:13:18.901 --> 00:13:20.210
Hurry up and get back in there!

215
00:13:21.016 --> 00:13:22.055
Wait!

216
00:13:22.055 --> 00:13:23.195
She said she wants
to use the bathroom!

217
00:13:23.195 --> 00:13:24.195
Oh yeah!

218
00:13:24.659 --> 00:13:26.218
Ow!
Ow!

219
00:13:26.218 --> 00:13:27.835
Ow, my arm!
My arm!

220
00:13:27.835 --> 00:13:29.758
Go, go, go!
Get in there!

221
00:13:34.441 --> 00:13:35.848
Is someone here?

222
00:13:35.848 --> 00:13:38.023
No, who could possibly be here?

223
00:13:38.023 --> 00:13:39.498
The bathroom is here.

224
00:13:39.498 --> 00:13:40.534
Oh, okay.

225
00:13:46.041 --> 00:13:48.056
Ow! Ow!

226
00:13:48.811 --> 00:13:50.186
Are you sure you're not
just over-exaggerating it?

227
00:13:50.724 --> 00:13:51.864
Are you sure you're even hurt?

228
00:13:51.864 --> 00:13:54.149
Why don't you recall your own past

229
00:13:54.149 --> 00:13:57.210
and think about whether or not you were
the type of 18 year old to do that!

230
00:13:58.388 --> 00:14:02.558
You're definitely a needy 18 year old
that's costing me a fortune, for sure.

231
00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:05.643
Just go back, already!

232
00:14:05.643 --> 00:14:07.365
Ugh, seriously!

233
00:14:22.835 --> 00:14:25.926
Are you sure that this wasn't all
a part of your scheme?

234
00:14:25.926 --> 00:14:27.527
You're the one who sprayed water on me!

235
00:14:27.527 --> 00:14:29.259
What? Did you just refer
to me in a disrespectful way?

236
00:14:29.259 --> 00:14:32.008
Why is it that you're speaking
more and more impudently to me?

237
00:14:32.008 --> 00:14:33.629
Come to think of it

238
00:14:33.629 --> 00:14:36.201
I have no reason to call you
my teacher anymore.

239
00:14:36.201 --> 00:14:38.584
After all, you're me.

240
00:14:39.513 --> 00:14:41.187
Isn't that right, Shin Woo?

241
00:14:41.187 --> 00:14:42.840
Ugh!

242
00:14:46.099 --> 00:14:49.229
It's not completely fractured,
but there is a tiny crack on your bone.

243
00:14:49.229 --> 00:14:51.575
We can formally admit you to the
hospital and keep an eye on it

244
00:14:51.575 --> 00:14:54.595
or you can just go to the outpatient
clinic since it's not too severe.

245
00:14:54.595 --> 00:14:56.154
I want to be admitted to the hospital!

246
00:14:56.154 --> 00:14:59.317
But he doesn't have his
health insurance on file.

247
00:14:59.317 --> 00:15:00.803
It'll cost quite a lot
if he's hospitalized.

248
00:15:00.803 --> 00:15:01.803
I want to be admitted to the hospital.

249
00:15:03.936 --> 00:15:06.771
If I can't be hospitalized with just a
tiny crack, I'll just break the bone!

250
00:15:06.771 --> 00:15:08.056
Ow!

251
00:15:09.979 --> 00:15:13.263
Then, we'll have you admitted for a
few days and monitor your injury.

252
00:15:15.162 --> 00:15:18.925
Oh, so he looks so much like you
since he's your relative, Shin Woo?

253
00:15:18.925 --> 00:15:20.430
Um, yeah.

254
00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:23.388
He's my relative, but also my disciple.

255
00:15:23.388 --> 00:15:24.476
Disciple?

256
00:15:24.476 --> 00:15:25.968
Oh, didn't I tell you?

257
00:15:25.968 --> 00:15:28.950
I became a teacher.
A high school teacher.

258
00:15:29.808 --> 00:15:31.588
Right, my disciple?

259
00:15:31.588 --> 00:15:32.917
Yes.

260
00:15:32.917 --> 00:15:34.561
Aren't you going to say,
"Yes, Teacher?"

261
00:15:35.569 --> 00:15:38.040
But, what's his name?

262
00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.806
He wouldn't tell me
last time, either.

263
00:15:39.806 --> 00:15:42.018
And his file says that
his name is "anonymous."

264
00:15:46.782 --> 00:15:48.254
His name is Deok Goo!

265
00:15:49.139 --> 00:15:51.143
His name is Deok Goo!
Deok Goo!

266
00:15:51.143 --> 00:15:54.957
It's because he has this kind of name
that he hates telling it to people.

267
00:15:54.957 --> 00:15:57.509
Oh... so that's why.

268
00:15:57.509 --> 00:16:00.213
That's the name of the dog
that we used to have!

269
00:16:00.213 --> 00:16:01.725
No, that's not my name...

270
00:16:01.725 --> 00:16:03.547
How dare you speak
informally to me!

271
00:16:03.547 --> 00:16:04.696
Oh.

272
00:16:04.696 --> 00:16:07.845
Please be understanding.
He used to live abroad.

273
00:16:07.845 --> 00:16:09.486
So not only does he
have no insurance

274
00:16:09.486 --> 00:16:11.495
but he also has no manners!

275
00:16:11.495 --> 00:16:13.623
No, my name isn't Deok Goo!

276
00:16:18.014 --> 00:16:20.772
He can just go to his hospital room
after he's done being treated.

277
00:16:21.412 --> 00:16:23.825
Are you here for good?

278
00:16:23.825 --> 00:16:25.725
Something came up.

279
00:16:25.725 --> 00:16:29.204
I'm going to go back to Seoul
as soon as I'm given the chance.

280
00:16:30.085 --> 00:16:31.939
Can we talk for a bit?

281
00:16:31.939 --> 00:16:33.523
- Tomorrow, I...
- Sorry.

282
00:16:33.523 --> 00:16:35.356
I'm busy right now.

283
00:17:17.917 --> 00:17:20.571
Shall I send the patient in, Doctor?

284
00:17:20.571 --> 00:17:21.860
Yes.

285
00:17:28.472 --> 00:17:29.982
S... Shin Woo.

286
00:17:29.982 --> 00:17:32.340
What? I really am a patient.

287
00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:34.947
I hurt this a while back,
but I didn't get it treated.

288
00:17:34.947 --> 00:17:37.548
And, oh yeah. I was in
a car accident, too.

289
00:17:37.548 --> 00:17:40.190
Let me see. Where does it hurt,
and how does it hurt, exactly?

290
00:17:41.242 --> 00:17:42.540
But...

291
00:17:42.997 --> 00:17:45.901
if you just sit here
for five minutes

292
00:17:45.901 --> 00:17:47.586
I think it'll get all better.

293
00:17:49.623 --> 00:17:51.209
I don't have time for this.

294
00:17:51.209 --> 00:17:52.774
If you don't want to see me
for an appointment...

295
00:17:52.774 --> 00:17:55.073
What I want to see
is you eating.

296
00:17:59.433 --> 00:18:03.711
It's way past lunchtime now
so you need to eat, at the very least!

297
00:18:03.711 --> 00:18:06.320
And it's not like you're the
only doctor at this hospital.

298
00:18:10.068 --> 00:18:12.477
When will you be done seeing patients?
Let's go eat together.

299
00:18:16.109 --> 00:18:17.818
This guy came with you, too?

300
00:18:17.818 --> 00:18:20.006
I thought this friend
of yours lived in Seoul!

301
00:18:23.571 --> 00:18:24.822
Doctor.

302
00:18:24.822 --> 00:18:27.771
One of the hospitalized patients
is asking for you.

303
00:18:28.751 --> 00:18:30.943
You didn't eat, Senior?

304
00:18:30.943 --> 00:18:33.137
Yeah, so that I could eat with you.

305
00:18:36.978 --> 00:18:38.651
Eat this, then.

306
00:18:38.651 --> 00:18:40.821
Hey, I told you.
I want us to eat together.

307
00:18:40.821 --> 00:18:42.375
I don't have an appetite.

308
00:18:44.945 --> 00:18:47.525
Ugh, and I had something
to talk to her about, too.

309
00:18:49.975 --> 00:18:51.121
What are you doing?

310
00:18:51.121 --> 00:18:52.823
I didn't buy this for you to eat!

311
00:18:52.823 --> 00:18:54.779
And I already ate...

312
00:18:55.645 --> 00:18:56.948
um, sir.

313
00:19:01.136 --> 00:19:02.530
What is it?

314
00:19:03.619 --> 00:19:08.076
Um, I was trying to look up and
I think that my neck kind of hurts.

315
00:19:10.063 --> 00:19:11.119
Goodness.

316
00:19:11.871 --> 00:19:13.013
Why?

317
00:19:13.013 --> 00:19:14.812
Does it hurt a lot?

318
00:19:14.812 --> 00:19:15.827
Doctor.

319
00:19:15.827 --> 00:19:17.639
Do I have to take
this medicine?

320
00:19:17.639 --> 00:19:19.929
Probably, if you want to
use that arm again.

321
00:19:19.929 --> 00:19:23.248
I have to eat food if I want to
take this medicine

322
00:19:23.248 --> 00:19:24.905
but I don't have an appetite.

323
00:19:24.905 --> 00:19:28.002
I think that, if someone eats
something in front of me

324
00:19:28.002 --> 00:19:30.215
I might have an appetite again.

325
00:19:31.869 --> 00:19:33.478
Can't you...

326
00:19:33.957 --> 00:19:35.796
eat a bit of this for me, Doctor?

327
00:19:35.796 --> 00:19:38.175
You... want me to
eat your food?

328
00:19:41.872 --> 00:19:43.141
What is it?

329
00:19:43.141 --> 00:19:46.247
It's just that this
reminds me of the past.

330
00:19:46.247 --> 00:19:48.438
I can just eat this for you.

331
00:19:48.438 --> 00:19:50.321
Hey, I already ate
some of it, though!

332
00:19:53.784 --> 00:19:56.809
<i>There was a friend of mine
who looked just like you.</i>

333
00:19:56.809 --> 00:20:01.916
And he ate my meal for me once,
a long time ago.

334
00:20:08.284 --> 00:20:11.610
Then, just pretend that you're
repaying your debt to that friend...

335
00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:14.311
and eat some of this.
At least just a little.

336
00:20:14.311 --> 00:20:16.737
If I eat some of this, then
you have to eat, too, okay?

337
00:20:16.737 --> 00:20:18.183
That way, you'll be able
to take your medicine.

338
00:20:18.183 --> 00:20:19.503
Of course.

339
00:20:37.568 --> 00:20:41.288
But, what kind of teacher
is your teacher, at school?

340
00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.934
Does he seem like
a good teacher to you?

341
00:20:43.934 --> 00:20:45.589
Well, yes.

342
00:20:46.237 --> 00:20:48.323
It's a bit awkward for me
to say that, though.

343
00:20:48.323 --> 00:20:50.271
I thought as much.

344
00:20:50.271 --> 00:20:54.006
He was quite a great friend
back then, too.

345
00:20:56.414 --> 00:20:59.465
But, is your name
really Deok Goo?

346
00:20:59.997 --> 00:21:01.257
W-why?

347
00:21:01.257 --> 00:21:05.164
I mean, you used to live overseas,
and yet your name is Deok Goo, so...

348
00:21:08.449 --> 00:21:09.523
What?

349
00:21:09.523 --> 00:21:10.615
It's nothing.

350
00:21:10.615 --> 00:21:12.674
Now that I think about it,
it's a great name.

351
00:21:12.674 --> 00:21:14.032
This name, I mean.

352
00:21:15.138 --> 00:21:18.463
Wow, I didn't know you had
such a skilled patient.

353
00:21:22.538 --> 00:21:25.828
It's been so long since
I've seen you smile like that.

354
00:21:27.295 --> 00:21:28.322
Oh!

355
00:21:28.322 --> 00:21:30.367
Isn't this guy the one who had
the umbrella yesterday?

356
00:21:30.367 --> 00:21:31.486
Yes.

357
00:21:31.486 --> 00:21:33.078
He's a patient who was
hospitalized today.

358
00:21:33.078 --> 00:21:35.827
Wow, is it okay for me to
be jealous of a patient?

359
00:21:35.827 --> 00:21:38.012
Ji Soo, I think I'm sick.

360
00:21:40.953 --> 00:21:42.867
He's a high schooler, okay?

361
00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:53.411
What's this about?
You came around before, too.

362
00:21:53.411 --> 00:21:55.940
I wanted to let you know that
you have tomorrow afternoon off.

363
00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:57.315
No, I'm not.

364
00:21:57.315 --> 00:21:58.450
Yeah, exactly.

365
00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:02.473
I figured you'd feel bad, so I
took care of your schedule for you.

366
00:22:02.473 --> 00:22:03.549
What?

367
00:22:03.549 --> 00:22:07.005
This day only comes around once a year,
so can't you remember it, already?

368
00:22:07.005 --> 00:22:09.071
Tomorrow is my birthday!

369
00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:12.680
Oh, I'm sorry, Senior!

370
00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:17.620
I've had to remind you last year,
and all the years before that!

371
00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:20.569
Does the birthday person have to
keep saying that it's their birthday?

372
00:22:20.569 --> 00:22:21.754
It's embarrassing!

373
00:22:22.603 --> 00:22:24.802
You feel super bad
about it, right?

374
00:22:25.293 --> 00:22:28.797
But, if you eat dinner with me tomorrow
I'll forgive this transgression.

375
00:22:28.797 --> 00:22:30.768
If she's celebrated your birthday
with you every year

376
00:22:30.768 --> 00:22:34.365
I think it'd be meaningful for you
to spend it alone this year

377
00:22:34.365 --> 00:22:36.623
and spend the day with thankful thoughts
toward your mom, who gave birth to you.

378
00:22:36.623 --> 00:22:38.594
Ugh, do you live at the
hospital, or something?

379
00:22:38.594 --> 00:22:40.276
Don't you ever go home?

380
00:22:46.873 --> 00:22:49.024
All of our friends are
meeting up tomorrow.

381
00:22:49.024 --> 00:22:50.815
Geun Deok, Min Seok, and So Ra.

382
00:22:50.815 --> 00:22:53.295
All of them have missed you a lot.

383
00:22:53.295 --> 00:22:55.712
So spend just
one day with us.

384
00:22:56.353 --> 00:22:57.790
It's been ten years, after all.

385
00:23:02.084 --> 00:23:03.796
<i>I'm not going to that.</i>

386
00:23:03.796 --> 00:23:06.304
I'm just asking you to come
and see our friends, is all.

387
00:23:06.801 --> 00:23:09.816
I'm sure that you'll run into them
at least once while you're here.

388
00:23:10.256 --> 00:23:12.738
So wouldn't it make you uncomfortable
to randomly bump into them instead?

389
00:23:12.738 --> 00:23:14.547
The thing that's making me
feel uncomfortable right now

390
00:23:14.547 --> 00:23:15.814
is you.

391
00:23:16.276 --> 00:23:17.941
Remember what I said last time?

392
00:23:17.941 --> 00:23:19.832
About how we should never
see each other again?

393
00:23:21.373 --> 00:23:23.173
I meant that.

394
00:23:23.173 --> 00:23:26.340
It can't be helped that I'll run
into you at the hospital, sure.

395
00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:28.347
But let's keep our relationship as one
between a doctor and a guardian.

396
00:23:28.347 --> 00:23:29.351
Nothing more.

397
00:23:29.351 --> 00:23:31.027
So, why, exactly?

398
00:23:31.027 --> 00:23:33.284
Why do we have to do that?

399
00:23:33.284 --> 00:23:37.203
At any rate, I can't go,
so just be aware of that.

400
00:23:38.792 --> 00:23:40.390
Han... Han Ji Soo!

401
00:23:46.914 --> 00:23:51.914
<font color="E06287">[DramaFever Ver] E07 Longing Heart</font>
<font color="#7474C1">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

402
00:23:58.547 --> 00:24:00.431
Who on earth...

403
00:24:00.883 --> 00:24:02.476
was that doctor from before?

404
00:24:02.476 --> 00:24:03.959
Ten years ago...

405
00:24:03.959 --> 00:24:06.315
I want to make things official
between us, and date you.

406
00:24:06.315 --> 00:24:08.313
he was the third year that
confessed to Ji Soo.

407
00:24:08.313 --> 00:24:09.927
What kind of relationship
does he have with Ji Soo?

408
00:24:09.927 --> 00:24:11.121
Are those two dating?

409
00:24:11.121 --> 00:24:13.201
I don't think they are.
Not yet.

410
00:24:14.401 --> 00:24:15.997
But who knows.

411
00:24:16.776 --> 00:24:18.026
"But who knows?"

412
00:24:18.026 --> 00:24:19.393
How could you say something like that?

413
00:24:19.393 --> 00:24:21.843
Hey, calm down.
You're a patient.

414
00:24:21.843 --> 00:24:23.908
How could I not be
worked up right now?

415
00:24:24.404 --> 00:24:25.736
It's bad enough that

416
00:24:25.736 --> 00:24:28.090
we're not friends anymore,
and I'm merely her patient!

417
00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:29.805
But now I know that,
in ten years

418
00:24:29.805 --> 00:24:32.132
I'll be nothing more than her
patient's guardian!

419
00:24:32.132 --> 00:24:34.084
That's why I told you to go back!

420
00:24:34.084 --> 00:24:36.334
No good will come out of you
knowing your future!

421
00:24:36.334 --> 00:24:37.380
Wow.

422
00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:39.257
So, this is how you're acting now,
and yet you told me to confess

423
00:24:39.257 --> 00:24:42.796
lectured me about regrets,
and acted all high and mighty toward me?

424
00:24:46.722 --> 00:24:48.328
Hey, Kang Shin Woo.

425
00:24:50.117 --> 00:24:52.594
You remember the last time
you met Ji Soo, right?

426
00:24:52.594 --> 00:24:53.651
Yes.

427
00:24:53.651 --> 00:24:56.101
To me, that only happened
a couple days ago, after all.

428
00:24:56.101 --> 00:24:59.606
Did anything seem off
about Ji Soo that day?

429
00:25:00.249 --> 00:25:01.821
<i>Did something happen?</i>

430
00:25:01.821 --> 00:25:03.288
What's this about your mom?

431
00:25:03.288 --> 00:25:04.475
It's nothing.

432
00:25:05.369 --> 00:25:07.164
I have to go for now.

433
00:25:09.095 --> 00:25:12.066
Let's talk about it again,
after I get back.

434
00:25:12.066 --> 00:25:13.393
I'll call you!

435
00:25:14.807 --> 00:25:17.327
There wasn't anything in particular
that seemed off about her.

436
00:25:20.544 --> 00:25:22.114
So then, why...

437
00:25:22.753 --> 00:25:26.036
did that day become the last day
that we met with Ji Soo?

438
00:25:59.757 --> 00:26:00.757
<i>[In Search of Lost Time]</i>

439
00:26:02.539 --> 00:26:06.230
<i>We're meeting at 7 p.m.
at Garam Bar tonight.</i>

440
00:26:06.747 --> 00:26:08.121
<i>I'll be waiting for you.</i>

441
00:26:09.256 --> 00:26:10.393
<i>[Senior Joo Hwan]</i>

442
00:26:12.794 --> 00:26:14.473
Yes, Senior?

443
00:26:14.473 --> 00:26:15.591
<i>Did you know?</i>

444
00:26:16.124 --> 00:26:17.153
Know what?

445
00:26:17.153 --> 00:26:18.623
In front of me right now

446
00:26:18.623 --> 00:26:21.717
are two plates, two sets
of knives and forks

447
00:26:21.717 --> 00:26:23.715
and there are two wine glasses, too.

448
00:26:23.715 --> 00:26:26.778
But I'm super lonely
and all alone here.

449
00:26:27.361 --> 00:26:31.981
<i>If you don't come, I'll light the
candles, clap, and sing by myself.</i>

450
00:26:31.981 --> 00:26:34.805
And I'll take a photo
while I cry

451
00:26:34.805 --> 00:26:38.139
and I'll send you that photo every day
until my birthday next year.

452
00:26:38.139 --> 00:26:39.663
Wow.

453
00:26:39.663 --> 00:26:41.864
I bet you'll feel so, so bad.

454
00:26:41.864 --> 00:26:42.891
Right?

455
00:26:49.565 --> 00:26:51.937
So, where are you now?

456
00:26:55.737 --> 00:26:57.867
Just a moment, Senior.

457
00:26:57.867 --> 00:26:59.232
I'll call you back.

458
00:27:02.123 --> 00:27:03.931
What are you doing,
with that arm?

459
00:27:03.931 --> 00:27:05.547
Do you want me to lend you an ear?

460
00:27:05.547 --> 00:27:06.805
That's my specialty.

461
00:27:07.312 --> 00:27:08.332
What?

462
00:27:08.332 --> 00:27:12.557
You look like you need someone
to lend you an ear right now.

463
00:27:14.987 --> 00:27:17.049
Right now, what I'm worried about

464
00:27:17.049 --> 00:27:19.967
is a high school-aged patient who won't
listen to his attending physician.

465
00:27:19.967 --> 00:27:23.141
Also, I didn't know there were doctors
who got consultations from patients.

466
00:27:26.598 --> 00:27:29.395
Then... be my friend instead.

467
00:27:31.909 --> 00:27:36.248
If I get this in,
will you be my friend?

468
00:27:56.142 --> 00:27:57.424
So...

469
00:27:58.341 --> 00:28:01.092
you're not dating that doctor, right?

470
00:28:01.092 --> 00:28:02.671
I told you, no!

471
00:28:03.184 --> 00:28:06.276
He's just a senior who's like
an older brother to me.

472
00:28:06.276 --> 00:28:08.624
I know a little about
brother-sister relationships

473
00:28:08.624 --> 00:28:11.228
but there aren't any big brothers
who make such aggressive moves!

474
00:28:11.228 --> 00:28:13.882
He does that to all women.

475
00:28:13.882 --> 00:28:16.177
And it's because I know that
that I'm tolerant of it.

476
00:28:16.873 --> 00:28:18.923
But, why am I telling you
about these things?

477
00:28:18.923 --> 00:28:20.479
What's the problem, then?

478
00:28:20.479 --> 00:28:22.720
You can just go and meet up
with your friends.

479
00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:24.785
Hasn't it been ten years?

480
00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:30.690
Is it because of my teacher,
by any chance?

481
00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:34.222
It's just that it's been ten years, now.

482
00:28:34.789 --> 00:28:37.241
What's the point in
seeing them now?

483
00:28:37.832 --> 00:28:39.931
When ten years go by

484
00:28:39.931 --> 00:28:43.342
feelings and memories
grow quite faint.

485
00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:46.132
I'm sure you don't quite
know that yet, though.

486
00:28:47.466 --> 00:28:49.098
Shall we head in now?

487
00:28:49.098 --> 00:28:50.264
You're lying.

488
00:28:52.392 --> 00:28:54.062
You wanted to see them.

489
00:28:55.221 --> 00:28:56.734
And even now...

490
00:28:58.159 --> 00:29:00.058
you want to see them.

491
00:29:03.006 --> 00:29:05.992
I heard this book is perfect for reading
when you can't fall asleep.

492
00:29:05.992 --> 00:29:10.319
If I can't fall asleep, all I need to do
is read two pages, and I'll be asleep.

493
00:29:12.372 --> 00:29:15.736
So I don't think you would've read
a book like this so intently.

494
00:29:16.716 --> 00:29:18.662
The thing you were looking at intently...

495
00:29:20.578 --> 00:29:21.933
was something else, right?

496
00:29:31.981 --> 00:29:35.372
If you feel awkward and shy about
seeing them after ten years

497
00:29:35.372 --> 00:29:37.646
I'll be the center of attention instead.

498
00:29:37.646 --> 00:29:39.052
What?

499
00:29:39.052 --> 00:29:42.144
You were quite surprised
when you first met me

500
00:29:42.144 --> 00:29:44.961
because you said that I look just like
my teacher when he was young.

501
00:29:44.961 --> 00:29:48.572
So if you go with me, they'll
all be too busy staring at me.

502
00:29:51.199 --> 00:29:52.999
Let's go together...

503
00:29:53.745 --> 00:29:55.648
to do what you
really want to do.

504
00:30:03.074 --> 00:30:04.525
So.

505
00:30:04.525 --> 00:30:07.361
You ended up submitting your
letter of resignation, after all?

506
00:30:09.668 --> 00:30:12.715
You know that the first character
in the word, "letter of resignation"

507
00:30:12.715 --> 00:30:14.384
means "death," right?

508
00:30:14.384 --> 00:30:18.037
What you're saying right now is that
you want to die by my hand, right?

509
00:30:18.037 --> 00:30:19.143
Whoa!

510
00:30:19.143 --> 00:30:21.607
I tried to stop him.
I really did.

511
00:30:21.607 --> 00:30:23.449
I'll really try hard.

512
00:30:23.449 --> 00:30:26.605
So just give me a chance.
Just once, please?

513
00:30:29.638 --> 00:30:31.090
What is that?

514
00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:33.231
I thought you were done with your shoot!
Get that out of here!

515
00:30:33.231 --> 00:30:36.816
No, I can't! I need to maintain my looks
even more on my down time!

516
00:30:36.816 --> 00:30:38.912
It's great for your skin.
Want to try it, too?

517
00:30:38.912 --> 00:30:40.414
Get that out of my face.

518
00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:44.504
Oh yeah, I heard you
invited one more person.

519
00:30:44.504 --> 00:30:45.659
Who is it?

520
00:31:08.632 --> 00:31:10.341
You came all this way.

521
00:31:10.766 --> 00:31:12.909
So it'd be a shame
to just leave now.

522
00:31:48.015 --> 00:31:50.042
<i>[New text from: Ji Soo]</i>

523
00:31:52.884 --> 00:31:54.707
<i>I'm sorry, Senior.</i>

524
00:31:54.707 --> 00:31:58.520
<i>I don't think I can come today.
Happy birthday.</i>

525
00:32:01.379 --> 00:32:03.419
Ow! Wait, that hurts!

526
00:32:04.157 --> 00:32:05.874
Are you out of your mind?
Have you lost it?

527
00:32:05.874 --> 00:32:07.212
How could you come here?

528
00:32:07.212 --> 00:32:10.401
My guardian is here, and I'm not
even wearing my school uniform!

529
00:32:10.401 --> 00:32:11.583
So there's no reason that
I can't come.

530
00:32:11.583 --> 00:32:13.065
I'm not talking about that!

531
00:32:13.065 --> 00:32:15.355
Didn't you see the look on
their faces earlier?

532
00:32:15.355 --> 00:32:17.952
Well, they fell for our lie, and
they think I'm your relative.

533
00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:21.794
But, wow. Our friends haven't
changed at all.

534
00:32:21.794 --> 00:32:23.452
It's seriously so amazing!

535
00:32:23.452 --> 00:32:25.930
When we go back in there, keep
your mouth shut as much as you can.

536
00:32:25.930 --> 00:32:28.488
And don't say any useless things, got it?

537
00:32:30.367 --> 00:32:32.975
I heard that you became a doctor

538
00:32:32.975 --> 00:32:34.930
but I didn't know
that you came back here.

539
00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:37.077
It hasn't been long
since I came here.

540
00:32:37.077 --> 00:32:39.631
You sure have a way with
surprising people

541
00:32:39.631 --> 00:32:41.948
when you leave, and when you come.

542
00:32:41.948 --> 00:32:43.444
Don't be like that.

543
00:32:44.132 --> 00:32:45.639
Damn it!

544
00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:49.806
I'm really sorry for what
I did to you guys back then.

545
00:32:49.806 --> 00:32:53.805
And I'm really sorry that
it's taken me so long to apologize.

546
00:32:53.805 --> 00:32:55.501
So, why did you leave so suddenly?

547
00:32:55.501 --> 00:32:58.510
I heard that you told So Ra that
you weren't even going to study abroad.

548
00:33:06.025 --> 00:33:08.440
I mean, it's not like
you guys are twins.

549
00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:10.798
So is it possible for you two
to look this similar?

550
00:33:10.798 --> 00:33:13.018
Well, they say that there are

551
00:33:13.018 --> 00:33:15.953
two other people in the world
who look just like you.

552
00:33:15.953 --> 00:33:17.933
Really!
Look it up.

553
00:33:17.933 --> 00:33:20.122
Well, I did hear that too, but...

554
00:33:20.122 --> 00:33:23.035
Well, why not? Our old homeroom
teacher looked just like him, too.

555
00:33:23.035 --> 00:33:25.533
And he's related to him, so it makes
sense that he'd look more similar.

556
00:33:25.533 --> 00:33:28.029
There's something I want to ask, though.

557
00:33:28.029 --> 00:33:30.429
When did you two get married?

558
00:33:30.429 --> 00:33:32.630
I don't even remember
when we got married.

559
00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:35.056
But we're planning to
get divorced today.

560
00:33:35.056 --> 00:33:36.058
But, why?

561
00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:39.950
Adults have their own
circumstances to deal with, Kid.

562
00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:41.075
"Kid?"

563
00:33:41.075 --> 00:33:42.161
I have another question, then.

564
00:33:42.161 --> 00:33:44.809
You're an actor, right? But how do you
manage to memorize your lines?

565
00:33:44.809 --> 00:33:47.159
I heard you gave up on memorizing the
multiplication table when you got to 5.

566
00:33:47.159 --> 00:33:48.249
Who said that?

567
00:33:48.249 --> 00:33:49.917
I memorized up to six,
at the very least!

568
00:33:49.917 --> 00:33:51.081
Liar.

569
00:33:51.081 --> 00:33:52.151
Go ahead, then.

570
00:33:52.151 --> 00:33:53.161
Hey!

571
00:33:53.161 --> 00:33:56.546
Hey... why do you keep
doing that to me?

572
00:33:56.546 --> 00:33:57.546
Huh?

573
00:34:00.254 --> 00:34:01.353
I'm sorry!

574
00:34:02.446 --> 00:34:04.297
Six times eight?

575
00:34:05.761 --> 00:34:07.163
T-thirty-three!

576
00:34:07.703 --> 00:34:10.183
Thanks for coming.

577
00:34:10.183 --> 00:34:13.018
No, you were right.

578
00:34:13.018 --> 00:34:14.103
Hey, let's do that again.

579
00:34:14.103 --> 00:34:16.145
I wanted to apologize to everyone...

580
00:34:16.692 --> 00:34:18.937
before I ran into them randomly.

581
00:34:18.937 --> 00:34:20.547
- Thirty-three!
- Jeez.

582
00:34:20.547 --> 00:34:21.707
Ta-da!

583
00:34:21.707 --> 00:34:23.522
Ugh, I'm so annoyed!

584
00:34:23.522 --> 00:34:25.812
Hey, let's have a proper duel!

585
00:34:27.926 --> 00:34:29.127
- Hm?
- Oh.

586
00:34:30.228 --> 00:34:31.515
It's me again.

587
00:34:32.388 --> 00:34:34.785
If she only smiles a lot
when she gets drunk

588
00:34:34.785 --> 00:34:35.928
that's pretty good.

589
00:34:35.928 --> 00:34:37.482
She's a lot better than
a certain someone.

590
00:34:37.482 --> 00:34:39.756
You're drunk.
You should stop.

591
00:34:39.756 --> 00:34:42.120
What do you mean, "stop?"

592
00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:45.950
Why would you tell her to stop
when Ji Soo hasn't answered anything?

593
00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:47.960
What about you?
You didn't answer, either.

594
00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:50.435
Before, Choo Geun Deok asked you if
you've ever regretted getting married.

595
00:34:50.435 --> 00:34:52.977
And then you said you'd drink
an entire bottle instead!

596
00:34:52.977 --> 00:34:55.660
Well, I was just really craving alcohol.

597
00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:58.922
Hey, hey, hey.
Send these guys home.

598
00:35:00.613 --> 00:35:03.004
All right. If you don't want to
talk about the present

599
00:35:03.004 --> 00:35:04.502
let's talk about the past.

600
00:35:05.013 --> 00:35:06.754
Um... oh!

601
00:35:06.754 --> 00:35:08.198
Your first love.

602
00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:12.790
The name of your first love, Ji Soo!

603
00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:15.103
My first love?

604
00:35:15.799 --> 00:35:17.259
Are you going to
pass on this one, too?

605
00:35:17.259 --> 00:35:19.622
Well, I guess it can't be helped, then.

606
00:35:21.118 --> 00:35:22.553
- Here.
- It's fine.

607
00:35:22.553 --> 00:35:23.654
I'll drink it.

608
00:35:23.654 --> 00:35:25.547
Kang Shin Woo.

609
00:35:25.969 --> 00:35:27.154
Huh?

610
00:35:27.154 --> 00:35:29.361
The name of my first love...

611
00:35:30.064 --> 00:35:31.627
is Kang Shin Woo.

612
00:35:37.335 --> 00:35:40.841
Oh, Mr. Kang Shin Woo, the teacher?

613
00:35:40.841 --> 00:35:44.015
Ji Soo is talking about
our old homeroom teacher.

614
00:35:44.015 --> 00:35:46.808
She did look at him in a way
that the other students didn't, yeah.

615
00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:52.743
Yeah, Na Hee?

616
00:35:52.743 --> 00:35:55.605
Oh, how could math supplement
English lessons?

617
00:35:55.605 --> 00:35:57.417
If you're drunk, then go to sleep!

618
00:35:57.417 --> 00:35:59.200
- Was that Ms. Baek?
- Yeah.

619
00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:01.131
She's drinking?
With who?

620
00:36:01.131 --> 00:36:03.277
The man she went on a
date with last time.

621
00:36:03.277 --> 00:36:06.140
Ugh, I'm so pissed!

622
00:36:08.638 --> 00:36:09.660
I'm going now.

623
00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:10.768
Hey, Choo Geun Deok!

624
00:36:10.768 --> 00:36:13.772
How could you just leave first, when
there are two people passed out here?

625
00:36:13.772 --> 00:36:15.440
You have Kang Shin Woo,
and this kid!

626
00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:16.921
Shin Woo can take care of Ji Soo.

627
00:36:16.921 --> 00:36:18.006
And as for Min Seok...

628
00:36:18.455 --> 00:36:19.631
you can take care of him.

629
00:36:21.076 --> 00:36:22.571
But, look at my arm!

630
00:36:22.571 --> 00:36:25.589
Shouldn't we switch?
This is just too cruel.

631
00:36:25.589 --> 00:36:28.917
That's why you need to support him,
since I have two arms, too.

632
00:36:28.917 --> 00:36:31.002
Hey, Kim Min Seok!
Get up. Let's go home.

633
00:36:31.453 --> 00:36:32.585
Put your glasses on.

634
00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:35.310
- Ugh.
- Hey.

635
00:36:36.377 --> 00:36:38.004
Are you okay, Ji Soo?

636
00:36:38.004 --> 00:36:39.480
Oh jeez.

637
00:36:41.355 --> 00:36:42.832
Ji Soo.

638
00:36:42.832 --> 00:36:44.089
Are you okay?

639
00:36:44.089 --> 00:36:45.489
Han Ji Soo!

640
00:36:51.913 --> 00:36:53.076
Why aren't you eating?

641
00:36:53.656 --> 00:36:55.027
Are you not feeling well?

642
00:36:55.027 --> 00:36:57.736
I didn't know we'd be
coming to a place like this.

643
00:36:57.736 --> 00:37:01.020
This place's soft tofu stew is the best.

644
00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:02.459
I'm telling you, it's a hidden gem!

645
00:37:02.459 --> 00:37:04.984
Sure.
Eat up.

646
00:37:04.984 --> 00:37:08.959
You have some money saved up
since you're old, right, Ms. Na Hee?

647
00:37:08.959 --> 00:37:09.995
What?

648
00:37:09.995 --> 00:37:11.886
I want to have the wedding
as soon as we can.

649
00:37:12.411 --> 00:37:17.018
My mom was worried, saying
that you may be a bit too old.

650
00:37:17.018 --> 00:37:21.933
I mean, to be frank, you're not exactly
at a prime childbearing age anymore.

651
00:37:22.732 --> 00:37:24.310
And well, I...

652
00:37:27.259 --> 00:37:28.873
am more than capable, stamina-wise.

653
00:37:28.873 --> 00:37:31.002
And I want to have three kids.

654
00:37:33.209 --> 00:37:36.457
Wow, you're really inconsiderate.

655
00:37:37.158 --> 00:37:38.756
My glass is empty!

656
00:37:38.756 --> 00:37:40.823
Alcohol tastes better
when a woman pours it.

657
00:37:48.359 --> 00:37:51.573
Alcohol tastes the best when a younger
"Big Brother" pours it for you.

658
00:37:55.183 --> 00:37:57.216
Here.
Drink up, Ms. Baek.

659
00:37:57.216 --> 00:37:59.430
How did you know
that I was here?

660
00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:01.417
I always manage to find you, remember?

661
00:38:08.524 --> 00:38:11.524
Oh, you look so pretty, Ms. Baek.

662
00:38:16.216 --> 00:38:17.489
Want me to buy you a meal?

663
00:38:17.489 --> 00:38:19.111
Didn't you see me
eating back there?

664
00:38:19.111 --> 00:38:21.180
Want me to buy you alcohol, then?

665
00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:23.946
It's fine, so don't follow me!

666
00:38:35.997 --> 00:38:37.926
Ugh, this is so humiliating!

667
00:38:37.926 --> 00:38:41.147
Why is it that I always
end up with terrible men?

668
00:38:41.147 --> 00:38:43.526
Hm... probably so that
you'll fall for me.

669
00:38:46.024 --> 00:38:48.861
Why has your temper
died down so much, Ms. Baek?

670
00:38:52.683 --> 00:38:56.027
So, stop settling for those
run-down carts

671
00:38:56.027 --> 00:38:58.163
and start riding in a nice,
new foreign car, already!

672
00:38:58.163 --> 00:39:01.513
Who says that I like foreign cars?

673
00:39:01.513 --> 00:39:04.413
All I want is a comfortable, compact car.

674
00:39:04.413 --> 00:39:07.073
A nice, compact car that won't
make me worry and think

675
00:39:07.073 --> 00:39:09.325
"oh, what if it breaks and
I can't ride it anymore?"

676
00:39:09.325 --> 00:39:12.000
To be honest, I hate the fact that
you're successful and rich!

677
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.600
And I hate the fact that
you're a celebrity

678
00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:15.638
and that you're
younger than me, too!

679
00:39:15.638 --> 00:39:16.953
Because all of those things...

680
00:39:17.591 --> 00:39:19.022
make me feel inferior to you!

681
00:39:19.022 --> 00:39:20.783
Why do you worry about
things like that?

682
00:39:21.292 --> 00:39:23.154
I'm the one who's inferior to you.

683
00:39:23.154 --> 00:39:26.031
Because I like you a lot more
than you like me

684
00:39:26.031 --> 00:39:29.122
so I'll always be the one
who'll be inferior to you.

685
00:39:32.696 --> 00:39:34.018
Ugh, seriously.

686
00:39:35.203 --> 00:39:38.024
I see that you're keeping your
arms to yourself until the very end.

687
00:39:38.024 --> 00:39:39.585
Well, I'm not as tall as you, so...

688
00:39:39.585 --> 00:39:41.044
Pass him over to me.
I'll lay him down.

689
00:39:41.044 --> 00:39:42.560
Ugh, you despicable thing!

690
00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:43.616
Where are your kids?

691
00:39:43.616 --> 00:39:45.122
They're at their grandma's house.

692
00:39:45.122 --> 00:39:47.777
Oh, what a shame.
I wanted to see them.

693
00:39:47.777 --> 00:39:49.243
We have photos of them here.

694
00:39:50.042 --> 00:39:51.669
Get it together, already!

695
00:39:56.218 --> 00:39:58.370
Oh gosh, what a surprise.

696
00:39:58.370 --> 00:39:59.888
Jeez.

697
00:40:00.732 --> 00:40:03.080
They would've been better off
if they'd taken after So Ra.

698
00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:04.989
This is why genetics is a scary thing.

699
00:40:05.721 --> 00:40:07.424
Want something to drink?

700
00:40:07.424 --> 00:40:08.754
Um, sure.

701
00:40:24.698 --> 00:40:26.051
But, um...

702
00:40:27.286 --> 00:40:30.832
isn't it okay for people to do
what they want to do in life, a little?

703
00:40:34.029 --> 00:40:36.794
Listen to me carefully.

704
00:40:36.794 --> 00:40:41.042
I'll give you some advice,
as someone who is older than you.

705
00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:43.647
Don't you ever...

706
00:40:44.181 --> 00:40:46.421
entertain anything stupid like dreams.

707
00:40:47.247 --> 00:40:49.450
Dreams that only make you
happy and satisfied

708
00:40:49.450 --> 00:40:51.710
while making everyone
around you miserable.

709
00:40:52.268 --> 00:40:54.828
Those aren't dreams.
They're poison.

710
00:40:55.283 --> 00:40:58.424
Your dreams won't keep being
exciting to you forever.

711
00:40:58.424 --> 00:41:00.321
It's the same thing as marriage.

712
00:41:00.321 --> 00:41:02.248
It briefly makes you happy
in the beginning.

713
00:41:02.926 --> 00:41:06.636
And on some days, you hate your spouse
so much that you could kill them.

714
00:41:08.379 --> 00:41:10.968
And on some days, you regret it
and wonder to yourself

715
00:41:10.968 --> 00:41:12.864
if you could've made
other choices in life.

716
00:41:13.366 --> 00:41:14.892
And there are some days

717
00:41:14.892 --> 00:41:17.142
when I want to slap myself in
the face for choosing this.

718
00:41:17.142 --> 00:41:18.460
But...

719
00:41:18.964 --> 00:41:21.602
no matter what you end up doing,
or who you end up living with...

720
00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:25.386
it all becomes the same, in the end.

721
00:41:26.794 --> 00:41:29.107
All of it ends up feeling
average and insignificant.

722
00:41:30.937 --> 00:41:32.502
So, make sure...

723
00:41:33.526 --> 00:41:35.875
that you live your life well,
and make smart choices.

724
00:41:35.875 --> 00:41:38.837
Don't end up saying such
naive things, like Min Seok.

725
00:41:39.431 --> 00:41:40.761
But...

726
00:41:42.343 --> 00:41:45.955
I wasn't talking about Min Seok...
er, I mean, Mr. Min Seok.

727
00:41:47.627 --> 00:41:49.259
I was talking about you.

728
00:41:49.754 --> 00:41:51.647
You were the one, right?

729
00:41:51.647 --> 00:41:54.047
The one who'd always bring
curling irons to school

730
00:41:54.047 --> 00:41:56.312
and collected pretty pictures.

731
00:41:56.312 --> 00:41:58.939
And would touch up your friends'
hair during break times.

732
00:41:59.406 --> 00:42:00.776
You were the friend

733
00:42:00.776 --> 00:42:03.067
who was most happy when
they did those things, right?

734
00:42:05.055 --> 00:42:06.852
In the photo over there.

735
00:42:15.223 --> 00:42:19.109
But now, you seem to be quite different
than you were in this photo.

736
00:42:24.314 --> 00:42:25.384
Hey.

737
00:42:25.384 --> 00:42:27.767
You need to get
educated by Shin Woo.

738
00:42:27.767 --> 00:42:31.000
Shin Woo knows how to say things like
this in a more pleasant way, at least.

739
00:42:31.544 --> 00:42:34.948
Also, of course I'd look older
when this photo was from 10 years ago!

740
00:42:34.948 --> 00:42:36.939
That's not what I meant.

741
00:42:37.442 --> 00:42:39.663
It's that... your eyes look different.

742
00:42:40.350 --> 00:42:43.210
In this photo,
your eyes are...

743
00:42:43.736 --> 00:42:46.413
your eyes are sparking brightly.

744
00:42:53.841 --> 00:42:55.710
I'll be going now.

745
00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:57.495
It's almost the hospital's curfew.

746
00:42:57.495 --> 00:42:58.837
Thank you for the beverage.

747
00:43:04.942 --> 00:43:06.375
Hey, Jang So Ra!

748
00:43:06.375 --> 00:43:08.609
Why are you getting me
all excited?

749
00:43:08.609 --> 00:43:09.616
Huh?

750
00:43:09.616 --> 00:43:12.132
I gave up on this already, so why?

751
00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:15.009
Why are you getting me
excited about this again? Why?

752
00:43:15.009 --> 00:43:18.247
Ten years ago, there was once a time
when your dream was me.

753
00:43:18.761 --> 00:43:20.861
So, can't you believe in me
just one more time, So Ra?

754
00:43:20.861 --> 00:43:22.410
<i>Just like you did back then?</i>

755
00:43:38.134 --> 00:43:41.477
It seems like adult life
is pretty complicated, too.

756
00:43:55.685 --> 00:43:57.303
Mr. Kang?

757
00:44:02.457 --> 00:44:04.096
Is this a dream?

758
00:44:06.035 --> 00:44:09.823
Oh, you gave me a piggyback ride
like this a long time ago, too.

759
00:44:10.915 --> 00:44:12.866
Right, Mr. Kang?

760
00:44:16.382 --> 00:44:17.674
I'm not.

761
00:44:31.131 --> 00:44:32.888
Take a good look at me.

762
00:44:34.951 --> 00:44:36.799
I'm not your teacher.

763
00:44:40.957 --> 00:44:42.584
Back then...

764
00:44:44.152 --> 00:44:47.047
there was so much
that I wanted to do for you.

765
00:44:48.245 --> 00:44:51.036
And there was so much
that I wanted to say to you!

766
00:44:51.812 --> 00:44:53.680
But I had to hold myself back so much

767
00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:56.366
because I was your teacher!

768
00:44:58.852 --> 00:45:00.477
So, do you really think...

769
00:45:01.129 --> 00:45:03.047
that I want to hear you
call me that again?

770
00:45:03.047 --> 00:45:04.792
But...

771
00:45:06.192 --> 00:45:09.370
You are my teacher, Mr. Kang.

772
00:45:09.370 --> 00:45:11.428
I told you, I'm not!

773
00:45:14.902 --> 00:45:16.372
Just...

774
00:45:16.971 --> 00:45:18.792
say that you are!

775
00:45:18.792 --> 00:45:20.881
This is my dream, anyway.

776
00:45:27.247 --> 00:45:28.544
Fine.

777
00:45:30.685 --> 00:45:31.930
Do it.

778
00:45:32.997 --> 00:45:34.696
Call me your teacher.

779
00:45:34.696 --> 00:45:36.370
See?

780
00:45:36.370 --> 00:45:38.145
You are.

781
00:45:53.721 --> 00:45:56.274
I really, really...

782
00:45:56.788 --> 00:45:58.469
wanted to see you
so badly...

783
00:46:01.672 --> 00:46:03.248
Mr. Kang.

came back here for all these years?</i>

792
00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:00.229
<i>Was there anything weird about
Ji Soo ten years ago, you ask?</i>

793
00:47:00.229 --> 00:47:01.814
<i>Come to think of it, back then...</i>

794
00:47:01.814 --> 00:47:05.388
<i>Does Kang Shin Woo
still like Han Ji Soo?</i>

795
00:47:05.388 --> 00:47:06.540
<i>Yeah.</i>

796
00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:09.193
<i>How could you say that,
considering what she did to us?</i>

797
00:47:09.193 --> 00:47:10.671
<i>Hey, Jang So Ra.</i>

798
00:47:10.671 --> 00:47:12.392
<i>Surely you knew
Han Ji Soo better than that.</i>

799
00:47:12.392 --> 00:47:15.611
<i>Making you feel pain, too,
would be even more cruel of me.</i>

800
00:47:15.611 --> 00:47:19.562
<i>So I'll forever live
miserable, by myself.</i>

801
00:47:19.562 --> 00:47:22.057
<i>The periphery of those eyes
that turned a fiery red.</i>

802
00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:24.937
<i>It may have been that,
at that moment...</i>

803
00:47:25.453 --> 00:47:27.696
<i>I got the feeling that...</i>

804
00:47:29.363 --> 00:47:31.513
<i>I had been unable to avoid...</i>

805
00:47:32.191 --> 00:47:33.854
<i>my true fate.</i>
