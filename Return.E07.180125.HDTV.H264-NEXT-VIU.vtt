1
00:00:05.855 --> 00:00:07.525
Previously on Return.

2
00:00:07.826 --> 00:00:11.965
When you make a joke, at least someone should enjoy it!

3
00:00:11.965 --> 00:00:14.365
Do you want to protect your wife...

4
00:00:14.836 --> 00:00:16.106
or your family?

5
00:00:16.106 --> 00:00:18.135
Na Ra is my family,

6
00:00:18.135 --> 00:00:20.705
and my family is meaningless without her.

7
00:00:21.876 --> 00:00:25.175
Die. Just die! Just die already!

8
00:00:25.175 --> 00:00:27.216
- Die! Die! - Stop it!

9
00:00:29.685 --> 00:00:31.516
- What are you doing? - Are you kidding me?

10
00:00:32.145 --> 00:00:33.156
Get out.

11
00:00:34.385 --> 00:00:37.025
How could you do this to me?

12
00:00:47.696 --> 00:00:50.166
Should we really bury her?

13
00:00:59.946 --> 00:01:02.516
Help! Is anyone out there?

14
00:01:03.046 --> 00:01:05.486
I was searching for her while investigating a drug case.

15
00:01:05.486 --> 00:01:07.486
- But what is this? - These are Roman numerals.

16
00:01:07.486 --> 00:01:09.055
- 99. - When is the time of death?

17
00:01:09.055 --> 00:01:11.085
There's a sign of the corpse being refrigerated.

18
00:01:11.085 --> 00:01:12.255
Is Mr. Kang In Ho home?

19
00:01:12.255 --> 00:01:15.255
You are under arrest for murdering and abandoning the body of Ms. Yum.

20
00:01:15.755 --> 00:01:17.165
Please help.

21
00:01:17.165 --> 00:01:20.496
With whom were you at the penthouse on December 3?

22
00:01:20.496 --> 00:01:22.096
The autopsy report says...

23
00:01:22.096 --> 00:01:25.165
Yum Mi Jung's body was stored in a refrigerator.

24
00:01:26.205 --> 00:01:28.606
Hey, that lunatic, Joon Hee is on his way to turn himself in.

25
00:01:28.606 --> 00:01:29.846
Seriously.

26
00:01:29.846 --> 00:01:31.906
Mr. Kim? This is an emergency.

27
00:01:31.906 --> 00:01:34.415
There's a matter you must take care of now. Get going.

28
00:01:34.675 --> 00:01:36.846
I will prove his innocence.

29
00:01:40.785 --> 00:01:42.955
Do you even know what those jerks did...

30
00:01:42.955 --> 00:01:44.986
while relying on their parents' money and power?

31
00:01:44.986 --> 00:01:47.526
Nonetheless, a police officer...

32
00:01:47.526 --> 00:01:50.096
must treat everyone equally.

33
00:01:53.865 --> 00:01:55.395
What are you going to do now?

34
00:01:55.395 --> 00:01:57.035
Are you saying we should push them off the cliff?

35
00:01:57.035 --> 00:01:58.266
What else can we do?

36
00:01:59.576 --> 00:02:00.736
Move it!

37
00:02:02.876 --> 00:02:04.945
(Episode 7)

38
00:02:26.265 --> 00:02:28.295
If everything you told me is true,

39
00:02:28.436 --> 00:02:31.436
you must find Mr. Seo Joon Hee to clear Mr. Kang's name.

40
00:02:34.906 --> 00:02:37.346
What is it? Did you think of something?

41
00:02:38.346 --> 00:02:40.545
Yes. I think I can find out.

42
00:03:07.235 --> 00:03:09.075
Hey, why are you here at this...

43
00:03:09.075 --> 00:03:10.146
Oh, my gosh!

44
00:03:10.776 --> 00:03:12.045
What's your problem?

45
00:03:12.045 --> 00:03:14.545
I'm sorry for coming at this hour. Would you please get Tae Suk?

46
00:03:14.945 --> 00:03:17.246
- He isn't home. - What do you mean?

47
00:03:17.246 --> 00:03:18.586
He didn't come home.

48
00:03:19.285 --> 00:03:20.755
He's been like this lately.

49
00:03:20.755 --> 00:03:22.515
I don't think it's work.

50
00:03:23.985 --> 00:03:25.526
It's probably because of In Ho,

51
00:03:25.526 --> 00:03:28.355
since that happened to a friend he hung out with all the time.

52
00:03:28.695 --> 00:03:30.526
Please give him a call.

53
00:03:30.526 --> 00:03:31.795
I don't have his number.

54
00:03:32.096 --> 00:03:33.265
Wait a second.

55
00:03:33.866 --> 00:03:36.635
I can't really ask you to come in.

56
00:03:37.406 --> 00:03:39.505
My apologies to the gentleman in the back.

57
00:03:41.336 --> 00:03:43.746
- Don't mind me. - You can come in by yourself.

58
00:04:01.195 --> 00:04:03.496
What's with the sudden downpour?

59
00:04:12.035 --> 00:04:13.235
Joon Hee.

60
00:04:14.635 --> 00:04:15.975
Give it a rest.

61
00:04:17.875 --> 00:04:20.816
You have no right to cry about Joon Hee.

62
00:04:21.076 --> 00:04:22.175
I...

63
00:04:23.446 --> 00:04:24.646
suddenly...

64
00:04:27.555 --> 00:04:28.956
got so angry.

65
00:04:35.055 --> 00:04:36.165
Tae Suk.

66
00:04:37.966 --> 00:04:40.235
I really didn't mean to kill him.

67
00:04:40.566 --> 00:04:42.165
Whether you did or not,

68
00:04:42.165 --> 00:04:44.136
we can't undo what's already been done.

69
00:04:45.305 --> 00:04:48.035
If you keep this up, I'll have to tell the police...

70
00:04:48.935 --> 00:04:51.346
exactly what you did.

71
00:04:51.576 --> 00:04:53.115
You have no right to cry, so stop it.

72
00:04:53.975 --> 00:04:55.045
You should stop.

73
00:05:01.516 --> 00:05:03.685
Hey. What's up?

74
00:05:03.886 --> 00:05:06.125
I'm not the one who's calling.

75
00:05:07.326 --> 00:05:09.326
Hold on. Wait a second.

76
00:05:12.795 --> 00:05:15.495
Hi, Tae Suk. It's Na Ra.

77
00:05:19.836 --> 00:05:20.836
Na Ra.

78
00:05:21.906 --> 00:05:23.846
I'm sorry for being inattentive.

79
00:05:24.346 --> 00:05:26.716
I should've been more attentive to you for In Ho's sake.

80
00:05:26.975 --> 00:05:29.545
I didn't have time to text and wait for a response.

81
00:05:30.985 --> 00:05:34.115
Did you talk to Joon Hee today by any chance?

82
00:05:37.225 --> 00:05:38.956
Joon Hee? Why?

83
00:05:39.285 --> 00:05:40.526
Isn't he home?

84
00:05:42.225 --> 00:05:44.026
It's kind of complicated.

85
00:05:44.026 --> 00:05:45.966
I got a call from him this morning,

86
00:05:45.966 --> 00:05:47.466
and he said he was by the police station.

87
00:05:47.636 --> 00:05:49.836
I haven't been able to reach him since then.

88
00:05:50.136 --> 00:05:52.305
- The police? - The detective says...

89
00:05:52.305 --> 00:05:54.136
there was an accident there.

90
00:05:54.235 --> 00:05:56.045
He says it was intentional.

91
00:05:56.245 --> 00:05:58.906
The camera caught Joon Hee being dragged away...

92
00:05:58.906 --> 00:06:00.975
by some strange man.

93
00:06:01.675 --> 00:06:03.615
So did they find the man...

94
00:06:04.685 --> 00:06:05.785
who dragged Joon Hee away?

95
00:06:06.216 --> 00:06:07.216
No.

96
00:06:08.216 --> 00:06:10.586
The video was too blurry,

97
00:06:11.055 --> 00:06:14.795
and the man was covering his face almost like he was wearing a mask,

98
00:06:14.795 --> 00:06:16.295
so it's too hard to identify him.

99
00:06:16.925 --> 00:06:18.896
The car he drove was a stolen car.

100
00:06:20.336 --> 00:06:21.735
What did the police say?

101
00:06:22.235 --> 00:06:23.566
They aren't much help.

102
00:06:24.206 --> 00:06:27.336
Will you please ask around about Joon Hee?

103
00:06:27.706 --> 00:06:28.906
Sure, I'll do that.

104
00:06:29.136 --> 00:06:32.375
I can't do it tonight though. I'm kind of far away.

105
00:06:32.605 --> 00:06:34.375
Oh, are you?

106
00:06:34.675 --> 00:06:37.985
What did Joon Hee say to you...

107
00:06:39.115 --> 00:06:40.355
when he called?

108
00:06:41.185 --> 00:06:42.886
I'm not sure about anything else,

109
00:06:46.855 --> 00:06:49.365
but he said In Wook didn't kill Mi Jung.

110
00:06:50.365 --> 00:06:53.466
He said he could send In Wook back home.

111
00:06:54.495 --> 00:06:59.206
Okay, Na Ra. I'm driving now, so I can't talk for long.

112
00:06:59.206 --> 00:07:00.706
I'll call you back later.

113
00:07:01.076 --> 00:07:02.576
Okay. I'm sorry.

114
00:07:02.776 --> 00:07:06.446
Please give me a call as soon as you get back to Seoul.

115
00:07:10.115 --> 00:07:11.745
What happens now?

116
00:07:12.115 --> 00:07:14.016
What if the cops find us?

117
00:07:15.516 --> 00:07:18.456
Do something, would you?

118
00:07:21.456 --> 00:07:22.696
Let's create an alibi.

119
00:07:24.165 --> 00:07:26.196
- Both of us. - How?

120
00:07:37.776 --> 00:07:39.716
Immediately after talking to Geum Na Ra,

121
00:07:39.975 --> 00:07:42.346
he made a U-turn and headed to the police station...

122
00:07:42.346 --> 00:07:43.785
when he was intentionally hit by another car.

123
00:07:46.985 --> 00:07:48.785
Immediately before talking to Geum Na Ra,

124
00:07:48.785 --> 00:07:51.526
this number called him five times...

125
00:07:51.526 --> 00:07:53.326
every 30 seconds or so.

126
00:07:53.326 --> 00:07:56.766
I looked up on that number, and it belongs to Kim Hak Bum.

127
00:07:57.425 --> 00:07:59.435
- Who? - Kim Hak Bum.

128
00:07:59.735 --> 00:08:02.066
It turns out he is one of the friends...

129
00:08:02.066 --> 00:08:04.805
that shared the penthouse with Kang In Ho.

130
00:08:05.766 --> 00:08:08.175
- Friends? - Didn't I tell you?

131
00:08:09.035 --> 00:08:10.805
They're all incredible.

132
00:08:11.776 --> 00:08:14.276
Oh Tae Suk, the CEO of Namo,

133
00:08:14.675 --> 00:08:16.516
the missing Seo Joon Hee,

134
00:08:17.816 --> 00:08:20.886
and Kim Hak Bum is the son of Myoungseong Foundation's owner.

135
00:08:28.756 --> 00:08:31.026
Look at these punks.

136
00:08:32.765 --> 00:08:35.096
- Here he is! - He's here.

137
00:08:35.336 --> 00:08:38.306
- Why did you kill her? - Do you feel wronged?

138
00:08:38.306 --> 00:08:40.706
Why did you maintain the affair?

139
00:08:40.706 --> 00:08:43.576
- What do you expect to happen now? - Move aside, please.

140
00:08:43.676 --> 00:08:45.145
- Do you admit to the murder? - Move aside.

141
00:08:45.375 --> 00:08:47.216
What was your reason?

142
00:08:49.385 --> 00:08:51.546
Move aside. Get out of the way!

143
00:09:00.926 --> 00:09:02.596
Postpone sending him to the prosecutor at least a day.

144
00:09:04.265 --> 00:09:06.265
What's wrong with you? You're not new to this.

145
00:09:06.696 --> 00:09:08.436
The boat has sailed already.

146
00:09:08.735 --> 00:09:10.436
"Goodbye."

147
00:09:10.635 --> 00:09:12.975
We already waved goodbye.

148
00:09:13.475 --> 00:09:16.275
If he's innocent, the prosecutor will find out.

149
00:09:17.676 --> 00:09:20.645
Darn it. Why won't you let me even clip my toenails?

150
00:09:21.615 --> 00:09:22.645
Captain.

151
00:09:25.145 --> 00:09:26.885
Hyun Bae! Seriously.

152
00:09:27.115 --> 00:09:28.586
Stop it. That's enough.

153
00:09:28.586 --> 00:09:32.326
Ever since "Return" aired the episode about Kim Young Geun,

154
00:09:32.525 --> 00:09:34.125
I feel like my head's going to explode.

155
00:09:34.495 --> 00:09:36.895
But I can't just leave this case alone!

156
00:09:37.166 --> 00:09:38.696
Fine. Then convince me.

157
00:09:39.125 --> 00:09:41.635
Evidence that Kang In Ho is not the killer.

158
00:09:42.365 --> 00:09:44.765
- I have no evidence. - You psycho.

159
00:09:45.005 --> 00:09:47.206
But there is a witness.

160
00:09:48.806 --> 00:09:50.275
- Where? - Where?

161
00:09:53.716 --> 00:09:54.816
He disappeared.

162
00:09:55.645 --> 00:09:58.186
You punk! Come see me after the witness gives a statement.

163
00:09:58.716 --> 00:10:02.385
Darn it. I was trying to trim my toenails for once.

164
00:10:09.865 --> 00:10:12.666
So a strange man faked a car accident...

165
00:10:12.666 --> 00:10:15.765
in front of the police station, and abducted him.

166
00:10:15.765 --> 00:10:18.806
And the abductor is that man with a black hat.

167
00:10:21.036 --> 00:10:22.135
Did the police identify the man?

168
00:10:22.806 --> 00:10:25.046
They couldn't identify him because the footage is too blurry.

169
00:10:28.076 --> 00:10:31.086
Gosh, this is so strange. I feel like I've seen him somewhere.

170
00:10:33.186 --> 00:10:34.556
You've seen him somewhere?

171
00:10:38.655 --> 00:10:39.696
Come in.

172
00:10:40.326 --> 00:10:41.655
- Ms. Choi. - Yes?

173
00:10:41.655 --> 00:10:42.966
You have a visitor.

174
00:10:47.365 --> 00:10:48.895
How did you get here?

175
00:10:49.735 --> 00:10:50.765
I can manage.

176
00:10:57.946 --> 00:10:58.946
Thank you.

177
00:11:04.346 --> 00:11:06.255
Please explain the purpose of your visit.

178
00:11:06.286 --> 00:11:09.355
I was informed that Mr. Kang's case was already sent to the prosecution.

179
00:11:09.655 --> 00:11:11.355
Let me have some coffee first, please.

180
00:11:11.426 --> 00:11:13.696
Why don't we skip the formalities?

181
00:11:13.926 --> 00:11:17.096
Please get to the point.

182
00:11:19.666 --> 00:11:22.036
I plan to reinvestigate the Yum Mi Jung's case.

183
00:11:22.036 --> 00:11:23.936
- You'll do that now? - I'll do it at least now.

184
00:11:30.975 --> 00:11:33.346
Ms. Geum, you should be here for this too.

185
00:11:35.145 --> 00:11:37.916
She's my co-counsel for this case.

186
00:11:44.326 --> 00:11:46.426
But why do you want to reinvestigate the case?

187
00:11:46.426 --> 00:11:48.456
You seemed very determined that there wouldn't be any compromises.

188
00:11:48.855 --> 00:11:51.066
Besides, this will be a closed investigation, no?

189
00:11:51.625 --> 00:11:54.436
Come on. I swallowed my pride and came here.

190
00:11:54.836 --> 00:11:56.505
Please give me a break.

191
00:11:58.336 --> 00:11:59.405
Let's hear it first.

192
00:12:02.605 --> 00:12:05.745
First off, I want to make this very clear.

193
00:12:06.816 --> 00:12:10.015
I am not here to help you two.

194
00:12:10.645 --> 00:12:13.485
I just don't want to put an innocent man in prison...

195
00:12:13.515 --> 00:12:15.755
because of my prejudice and mistakes.

196
00:12:15.786 --> 00:12:18.255
That's what we'd like to ask of you.

197
00:12:18.826 --> 00:12:20.826
When it happens for the first time, it's a mistake.

198
00:12:20.956 --> 00:12:23.865
But starting the second time, people see it as one's competency.

199
00:12:26.966 --> 00:12:29.235
Without violating the morals of your expertise,

200
00:12:30.036 --> 00:12:32.436
tell me what you know. Tell me everything.

201
00:12:35.875 --> 00:12:38.405
Kim Hak Bum. Oh Tae Suk.

202
00:12:40.775 --> 00:12:41.846
How nice to hear those names.

203
00:12:46.385 --> 00:12:49.155
So these jerks got together again, right?

204
00:12:51.326 --> 00:12:52.796
A reunion after nine years.

205
00:12:54.625 --> 00:12:56.966
Oh Tae Suk of Namo...

206
00:12:56.966 --> 00:13:00.196
and Seo Joon Hee of Daemyung Hospital are involved in this case.

207
00:13:00.536 --> 00:13:01.536
Based on what?

208
00:13:01.735 --> 00:13:04.836
A day before the corpse was found on the road in Paju,

209
00:13:04.836 --> 00:13:08.176
a guard made a statement that he saw Oh Tae Suk at the penthouse.

210
00:13:09.336 --> 00:13:11.046
The guard stated that he saw Oh Tae Suk...

211
00:13:11.046 --> 00:13:14.816
kissing a woman at the stairwell where there are no CCTVs.

212
00:13:14.946 --> 00:13:15.946
Nothing about that seems suspicious.

213
00:13:16.086 --> 00:13:17.846
According to the guard's memory,

214
00:13:17.885 --> 00:13:19.456
the woman was Yum Mi Jung.

215
00:13:20.615 --> 00:13:22.416
He told me that he saw her face.

216
00:13:23.286 --> 00:13:25.926
As well as the mole on the back of her hand.

217
00:13:25.926 --> 00:13:27.655
He precisely remembered her mole.

218
00:13:29.765 --> 00:13:31.796
I won't let you get away this time.

219
00:13:33.696 --> 00:13:36.936
Whatever you did, I'm going to find out everything.

220
00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:50.960
<font color="#fcc89b">[VIU Ver] E07 Return "We Found His Car"</font>
<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

221
00:14:00.025 --> 00:14:03.196
Na Ra, I'm sorry for making you wait so often.

222
00:14:03.196 --> 00:14:05.966
No, don't be. I should be sorry. I know how busy you are.

223
00:14:06.066 --> 00:14:07.166
Please take a seat.

224
00:14:08.536 --> 00:14:09.605
Did you order your tea?

225
00:14:09.836 --> 00:14:10.836
No, not yet.

226
00:14:10.836 --> 00:14:13.005
- We should order beverages. - Wait, before we order,

227
00:14:14.536 --> 00:14:16.676
when was the last time you talked with Joon Hee?

228
00:14:17.505 --> 00:14:19.816
We briefly talked on the phone in the afternoon two days ago.

229
00:14:21.046 --> 00:14:24.446
I've been calling him since last night after getting your call.

230
00:14:25.216 --> 00:14:26.615
But I can't reach him.

231
00:14:29.786 --> 00:14:31.426
I've been so worried that I couldn't get any sleep.

232
00:14:31.786 --> 00:14:34.796
Didn't he say anything unusual when you talked with him?

233
00:14:36.625 --> 00:14:39.365
He did sound slightly strange more than usual.

234
00:14:40.235 --> 00:14:41.895
He sounded nervous.

235
00:14:42.135 --> 00:14:43.536
He was talking frantically too.

236
00:14:44.235 --> 00:14:45.505
Actually, he also...

237
00:14:46.436 --> 00:14:47.436
told me...

238
00:14:48.536 --> 00:14:51.046
that he didn't think In Ho murdered Mi Jung.

239
00:14:51.806 --> 00:14:53.946
He said that In Ho couldn't have murdered a woman he loved.

240
00:14:55.645 --> 00:14:57.446
I disregarded what he said since it didn't sound logical.

241
00:15:04.025 --> 00:15:06.956
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you.

242
00:15:18.206 --> 00:15:20.176
So Kang In Ho didn't kill Yum Mi Jung?

243
00:15:22.536 --> 00:15:26.076
He'd been talking like a mad man, so I was worried about him.

244
00:15:27.775 --> 00:15:29.015
So I kept calling him.

245
00:15:29.786 --> 00:15:30.946
When was that?

246
00:15:31.946 --> 00:15:34.456
Yesterday, around 10am.

247
00:15:36.956 --> 00:15:37.956
Or was it 11am?

248
00:15:39.025 --> 00:15:41.426
Hak Bum, we must stay focused.

249
00:15:41.725 --> 00:15:44.826
A detective is going to contact you soon.

250
00:15:47.536 --> 00:15:49.296
Why would a detective contact me?

251
00:15:49.605 --> 00:15:51.066
If you can't handle it, turn yourself in.

252
00:15:51.066 --> 00:15:52.066
Have you gone mad?

253
00:15:54.036 --> 00:15:55.135
I can't do that.

254
00:15:55.235 --> 00:15:56.676
Then listen to me carefully.

255
00:15:57.446 --> 00:15:58.946
If a detective visits you,

256
00:16:00.346 --> 00:16:02.015
tell him exactly what happened.

257
00:16:03.745 --> 00:16:05.446
Only up until we met up with Joon Hee.

258
00:16:08.855 --> 00:16:13.395
I'm sure the news that Kang In Ho didn't kill Yum Mi Jung shocked you.

259
00:16:13.725 --> 00:16:15.056
Why didn't you do anything about it?

260
00:16:16.865 --> 00:16:18.466
I bet the four of you...

261
00:16:18.466 --> 00:16:20.765
must've gone through a lot together since you were young.

262
00:16:21.536 --> 00:16:24.666
If I had such close friends, I would've gone to the police...

263
00:16:24.966 --> 00:16:28.135
or met Seo Joon Hee to check if it's true or not.

264
00:16:28.135 --> 00:16:30.645
He was talking so frantically.

265
00:16:31.745 --> 00:16:35.115
Mi Jung's death shocked Joon Hee...

266
00:16:35.375 --> 00:16:37.946
more than In Ho's arrest.

267
00:16:38.416 --> 00:16:39.885
He relied on her a lot.

268
00:16:41.556 --> 00:16:43.155
We'll come up with an alibi.

269
00:16:43.225 --> 00:16:45.586
How are we going to do that? We don't have an alibi.

270
00:16:46.426 --> 00:16:47.495
Try this.

271
00:16:52.296 --> 00:16:54.235
Where were you after you talked with Seo Joon Hee?

272
00:16:55.536 --> 00:16:57.836
I fell asleep in my office.

273
00:16:59.066 --> 00:17:00.076
At night,

274
00:17:01.775 --> 00:17:02.775
I was at a club.

275
00:17:04.776 --> 00:17:07.476
You've been living a diligent life despite what's happened.

276
00:17:08.316 --> 00:17:09.546
That sounded like sarcasm.

277
00:17:09.786 --> 00:17:11.986
No, no. That was a compliment.

278
00:17:15.316 --> 00:17:17.155
By any chance, do you not remember me?

279
00:17:20.296 --> 00:17:21.455
Then what about Kim Soo Hyun?

280
00:17:23.566 --> 00:17:24.596
I don't know.

281
00:17:24.925 --> 00:17:26.066
Then we'll skip it.

282
00:17:26.935 --> 00:17:28.895
You said you fell asleep in your office.

283
00:17:28.895 --> 00:17:31.205
Is there anyone who can confirm your alibi?

284
00:17:34.576 --> 00:17:35.576
Hello, sir.

285
00:17:36.076 --> 00:17:38.945
Hey, until what time was I at the university yesterday?

286
00:17:39.205 --> 00:17:42.346
Didn't you leave after getting a call around 10am?

287
00:17:42.346 --> 00:17:44.316
That's a load of nonsense.

288
00:17:44.415 --> 00:17:47.615
I accidentally fell asleep in my office past 11am.

289
00:17:47.816 --> 00:17:49.855
Didn't I tell you to wake me up after an hour?

290
00:17:50.026 --> 00:17:51.655
I told you that I had a lunch meeting with the chancellor.

291
00:17:52.226 --> 00:17:55.096
When I woke up, it was getting dark. Do you know how flustered I was?

292
00:17:55.425 --> 00:17:58.566
I couldn't attend the meeting! I woke up too late!

293
00:18:01.665 --> 00:18:03.405
This is really upsetting the more I think about this.

294
00:18:03.635 --> 00:18:04.806
I'm sorry, sir.

295
00:18:04.865 --> 00:18:07.736
I must've been too busy checking if everyone submitted the assignment.

296
00:18:07.736 --> 00:18:08.776
Come here.

297
00:18:12.046 --> 00:18:14.346
Hey, do you not want to become a professor?

298
00:18:15.516 --> 00:18:16.516
Then don't.

299
00:18:17.415 --> 00:18:18.445
Go.

300
00:18:18.816 --> 00:18:19.816
No, sir.

301
00:18:20.655 --> 00:18:22.155
I'm sorry, sir.

302
00:18:23.226 --> 00:18:25.756
Do better. Okay?

303
00:18:32.026 --> 00:18:35.695
He slept in his office until it got dark.

304
00:18:36.205 --> 00:18:37.336
What was the exact time?

305
00:18:38.536 --> 00:18:40.105
I don't know the exact time,

306
00:18:40.306 --> 00:18:42.806
but I think it was past 6pm.

307
00:18:43.875 --> 00:18:45.145
But did you see him in the office?

308
00:18:45.546 --> 00:18:46.615
I saw him in the office...

309
00:18:47.875 --> 00:18:49.246
probably around 11am.

310
00:18:49.786 --> 00:18:52.516
Right. I saw him a little past 11am.

311
00:18:56.855 --> 00:19:00.826
Yes. Kim Hak Bum's teaching assistant confirmed his alibi.

312
00:19:01.826 --> 00:19:02.826
What about you?

313
00:19:03.925 --> 00:19:05.296
It's the same here too.

314
00:19:05.465 --> 00:19:09.296
The imported car dealer just told me they drank until late at a club.

315
00:19:09.766 --> 00:19:10.965
Yes, Hak Bum?

316
00:19:12.336 --> 00:19:14.675
A detective just visited me.

317
00:19:15.536 --> 00:19:16.976
Why is he here?

318
00:19:19.615 --> 00:19:20.746
You didn't tip them off about me, right?

319
00:19:21.246 --> 00:19:24.786
Don't worry. That's not why he came to you.

320
00:19:24.945 --> 00:19:25.986
Then... Then why?

321
00:19:25.986 --> 00:19:29.385
I bought a vintage car online.

322
00:19:29.655 --> 00:19:31.486
It turns out it's an untraceable vehicle the police was looking into.

323
00:19:32.226 --> 00:19:33.895
Gosh, it's giving me a headache.

324
00:19:35.625 --> 00:19:36.965
Is that it?

325
00:19:37.625 --> 00:19:39.326
- Why did the detective say? - Well,

326
00:19:39.326 --> 00:19:41.836
he asked if I was really with you last night.

327
00:19:44.435 --> 00:19:45.435
So?

328
00:19:46.205 --> 00:19:48.506
I told him the truth.

329
00:19:50.346 --> 00:19:54.546
But are you sure that we were drinking together last night?

330
00:19:58.546 --> 00:20:02.286
Goodness, I can't believe you. You must've taken a lot last night.

331
00:20:02.756 --> 00:20:03.826
I knew it.

332
00:20:04.185 --> 00:20:06.425
You were already so high when I saw you.

333
00:20:07.195 --> 00:20:09.226
Don't tell anyone about that. Okay?

334
00:20:09.226 --> 00:20:10.695
Your secret is safe with me.

335
00:20:11.226 --> 00:20:13.465
Whatever vehicle I want,

336
00:20:13.536 --> 00:20:15.036
you get them for me.

337
00:20:15.036 --> 00:20:18.665
What would I do if you went to jail?

338
00:20:21.605 --> 00:20:22.746
True, true.

339
00:20:23.046 --> 00:20:27.046
Okay. I'll take you somewhere nice and buy drinks.

340
00:20:27.615 --> 00:20:28.976
My beloved client.

341
00:20:28.976 --> 00:20:32.885
Sure. Let's meet up sober next time, okay?

342
00:20:42.226 --> 00:20:45.566
You're in the palm of my hand,

343
00:20:45.865 --> 00:20:47.266
you druggie.

344
00:21:01.476 --> 00:21:04.215
You look even worse than last time.

345
00:21:08.685 --> 00:21:09.786
How's Na Ra?

346
00:21:10.125 --> 00:21:11.855
She's eating well...

347
00:21:11.855 --> 00:21:14.296
and doing well in order to defend you.

348
00:21:15.355 --> 00:21:18.726
So you should make some effort too.

349
00:21:20.665 --> 00:21:22.266
At least for Dal Rae's sake.

350
00:21:25.435 --> 00:21:28.276
We're in a new place now, so let's be strong.

351
00:21:28.276 --> 00:21:31.076
Oh Tae Suk, Seo Joon Hee, and Kim Hak Bum.

352
00:21:31.405 --> 00:21:33.776
Tell me about those three friends.

353
00:21:34.645 --> 00:21:36.346
Why do you ask about them?

354
00:21:37.086 --> 00:21:39.586
(Gangdong Precinct)

355
00:21:43.726 --> 00:21:46.596
- Hey! - You scared me.

356
00:21:47.526 --> 00:21:48.655
Darn it.

357
00:21:50.425 --> 00:21:52.836
I went to sleep only half an hour ago.

358
00:21:53.135 --> 00:21:54.336
Did you sleep here again?

359
00:21:55.336 --> 00:21:57.935
I have news to kill that rage.

360
00:21:59.105 --> 00:22:01.605
- What is it? - We found Seo Joon Hee's car.

361
00:22:16.486 --> 00:22:19.155
(Police)

362
00:22:27.836 --> 00:22:30.405
We started a national search for the car, and they called us.

363
00:22:31.036 --> 00:22:34.205
There were no skid marks up top. Was it really an accident?

364
00:22:34.205 --> 00:22:36.346
We'll have to investigate to find out,

365
00:22:37.276 --> 00:22:40.115
but it poured the night he was abducted.

366
00:22:40.445 --> 00:22:42.145
I think that's when it happened.

367
00:22:50.685 --> 00:22:52.286
(Kang Sung Wook)

368
00:22:52.756 --> 00:22:54.056
- I'm sorry. - No problem.

369
00:22:55.056 --> 00:22:57.665
How could a body disappear from a hospital morgue?

370
00:22:57.665 --> 00:22:59.435
Detective Lee. Go to Traffic Control.

371
00:23:00.266 --> 00:23:01.266
Excuse me.

372
00:23:01.596 --> 00:23:03.905
Who's investigating the car that went down the cliff?

373
00:23:04.066 --> 00:23:06.236
- Here you go. - Thank you.

374
00:23:07.205 --> 00:23:08.435
Isn't it strange?

375
00:23:08.705 --> 00:23:10.605
The accident itself is strange too,

376
00:23:10.605 --> 00:23:13.546
but no one takes that road because it's so dangerous.

377
00:23:13.746 --> 00:23:15.645
Especially not people who aren't from here.

378
00:23:16.286 --> 00:23:18.385
It's also a circuitous route,

379
00:23:18.385 --> 00:23:20.415
so I don't know why either the one in the accident...

380
00:23:20.415 --> 00:23:22.256
or the one who found it was driving there.

381
00:23:23.026 --> 00:23:25.125
- Who reported it? - It was an anonymous caller.

382
00:23:25.125 --> 00:23:27.256
I called back to check something,

383
00:23:27.596 --> 00:23:28.695
but it was a payphone.

384
00:23:28.695 --> 00:23:30.165
Did you check the CCTVs?

385
00:23:30.165 --> 00:23:33.165
That's strange too. There aren't any cameras there.

386
00:23:33.635 --> 00:23:35.566
It's very suspicious,

387
00:23:35.836 --> 00:23:37.536
but I have no clues to warrant that.

388

(Kyungchoon Hospital)

389
00:23:42.135 --> 00:23:43.846
It doesn't look like a simple car accident.

390
00:23:44.846 --> 00:23:46.415
Did you contact Seo Joon Hee's family?

391
00:23:46.415 --> 00:23:48.645
Yes. They should've gone to identify the body by now.

392
00:23:48.915 --> 00:23:51.215
- Where are you? - The same place.

393
00:23:54.016 --> 00:23:55.115
Father.

394
00:24:10.365 --> 00:24:13.036
(We will treat you like our family, Kyungchoon Hospital)

395
00:24:13.036 --> 00:24:14.036
Just a minute.

396
00:24:14.306 --> 00:24:16.546
I'm... I'm not ready yet.

397
00:24:22.576 --> 00:24:24.986
Father, I'll do it.

398
00:24:26.086 --> 00:24:27.816
I'll identify Joon Hee.

399
00:24:28.486 --> 00:24:30.326
Please wait outside. Go on.

400
00:24:37.826 --> 00:24:40.066
No, Joon.

401
00:24:44.665 --> 00:24:45.935
I'm the detective on the case.

402
00:25:02.855 --> 00:25:06.125
If you look away, you can't identify the body.

403
00:25:06.125 --> 00:25:07.125
Yes.

404
00:25:08.026 --> 00:25:09.296
It is Joon Hee.

405
00:25:10.226 --> 00:25:13.135
He is a total mess. You can't even see his shape.

406
00:25:13.135 --> 00:25:14.566
Are you sure it's Seo Joon Hee?

407
00:25:17.105 --> 00:25:19.836
Yes, it is.

408
00:25:21.875 --> 00:25:24.675
- How are you so sure? - This watch.

409
00:25:25.875 --> 00:25:27.246
I bought it for him...

410
00:25:28.276 --> 00:25:29.685
when I was traveling in Switzerland.

411
00:25:35.286 --> 00:25:36.885
It's very expensive,

412
00:25:37.086 --> 00:25:41.996
so not anyone can wear such a watch.

413
00:26:04.746 --> 00:26:05.846
Hi, Jin Joo.

414
00:26:05.846 --> 00:26:08.115
What took you so long?

415
00:26:09.056 --> 00:26:11.425
Sweetie, have you heard?

416
00:26:11.885 --> 00:26:12.955
What...

417
00:26:15.695 --> 00:26:17.465
About Joon Hee.

418
00:26:17.465 --> 00:26:19.195
Did they find him?

419
00:26:19.326 --> 00:26:20.665
You haven't heard, right?

420
00:26:22.836 --> 00:26:24.165
Joon Hee...

421
00:26:25.935 --> 00:26:28.336
died in a car accident.

422

00:28:51.346 --> 00:28:54.955
You can do anything

424
00:28:55.455 --> 00:28:57.385
- Lizard - Who are you?

What are you staring at?

429
00:29:53.846 --> 00:29:54.846
That picture.

430
00:29:55.776 --> 00:29:58.016
I don't think it's Seo Joon Hee.

431
00:29:58.586 --> 00:29:59.586
Why not?

432
00:30:00.056 --> 00:30:01.685
If you look at the CCTV video,

433
00:30:01.885 --> 00:30:04.526
Seo Joon Hee is at least 180cm tall.

434
00:30:05.086 --> 00:30:08.296
But that body is at most 160cm.

- Hey, rookie. - Yes?

436

Take a close look at those two photos.

(Seo Joon Hee, 33, male)

438

But what am I looking for?

439
00:30:23.145 --> 00:30:24.776
Do you notice anything strange?

440
00:30:25.445 --> 00:30:26.875
Are you talking about the watch?

441
00:30:27.976 --> 00:30:30.846
- The watch? - It's a left-handed watch,

442
00:30:30.846 --> 00:30:32.445
but it's on his right wrist.

443
00:30:33.355 --> 00:30:35.355
There's a left-handed watch?

444
00:30:35.615 --> 00:30:37.655
Some of designer watches are for left-handed people.

445
00:30:37.655 --> 00:30:38.955
How can you tell the difference?

446
00:30:38.955 --> 00:30:41.026
You know the crown, the thing that winds the spring?

447
00:30:41.326 --> 00:30:43.425
Usually, it's located on the right side,

448
00:30:44.066 --> 00:30:45.226
but that one is on its left.

449
00:30:51.105 --> 00:30:52.736
Rookie, that was great. Great job.

450

Yes, probably.

452

I saw an article that his funeral is being held in Daemyung Hospital.

458
00:31:24.135 --> 00:31:25.506
Then what?

459
00:31:26.875 --> 00:31:28.905
How can I face Joon Hee?

460
00:31:29.605 --> 00:31:31.776
All right then. Let's head to the station right now.

We're already in our mourning suit.

You can pay for your sin that way. How about that?

Decide until I count to five. If you can't decide,

464

I'll drive you to the station.

I'll go in.

471

Fine, I'll go.

- Get him to the ward. He's shocked. - Joon Hee, why are you smiling?

No, no! This isn't happening!

485
00:33:11.945 --> 00:33:14.346
- Move him to the ward. - I'm sorry, Joon Hee.

486
00:33:15.576 --> 00:33:17.145
Get off me, you jerks.

Let go of me, you morons.

What are you doing with my friend over there? You pests!

492

00:33:54.455 --> 00:33:55.615
Hey.

495
00:33:58.155 --> 00:33:59.256
I'm too embarrassed to face you.

496
00:34:01.496 --> 00:34:04.895
I should have protected Joon Hee.

497
00:34:06.336 --> 00:34:07.336
The police...

498
00:34:08.666 --> 00:34:10.465
called me just now.

499
00:34:12.065 --> 00:34:14.036
They are going to run a DNA test.

500
00:34:15.076 --> 00:34:16.175
They want me...

501
00:34:16.976 --> 00:34:21.545
to send them the dental records from the US.

502
00:34:22.545 --> 00:34:24.016
Can they...

503
00:34:26.155 --> 00:34:28.155
still run the DNA test when his body is burnt like that?

504
00:34:29.056 --> 00:34:30.456
It's possible...

505
00:34:31.286 --> 00:34:32.556
if any of his tissues are left.

506
00:34:33.155 --> 00:34:36.365
The police want to run a DNA test by using that.

507
00:34:39.266 --> 00:34:42.065
Are you certain that it's Joon Hee?

508
00:34:42.065 --> 00:34:43.106
I'm certain.

509
00:34:43.766 --> 00:34:44.766
I...

510
00:34:46.905 --> 00:34:48.405
I checked everything.

511
00:34:53.175 --> 00:34:56.215
But I must identify the body...

512
00:34:58.045 --> 00:34:59.655
just in case.

513
00:35:02.056 --> 00:35:03.056
To be honest,

514
00:35:04.755 --> 00:35:06.655
Joon Hee was doing drugs.

515
00:35:09.766 --> 00:35:11.126
The police are investigating...

516
00:35:12.266 --> 00:35:14.465
with the theory that Joon Hee is connected to In Ho's case.

517
00:35:19.036 --> 00:35:21.775
If they run an autopsy under premises of running a DNA test...

518
00:35:24.045 --> 00:35:25.246
That worries me.

519
00:35:26.476 --> 00:35:27.815
What do you mean?

520
00:35:29.485 --> 00:35:30.485
The detective...

521
00:35:31.516 --> 00:35:33.615
is overly enthusiastic.

522
00:35:35.356 --> 00:35:36.525
Don't get involved.

523
00:35:37.655 --> 00:35:39.356
It will only create strange rumors.

524
00:35:40.556 --> 00:35:41.626
Okay.

525
00:35:43.396 --> 00:35:44.596
I'll take care of it.

526
00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:54.120
(Episode 8 will air shortly.)
