1
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:07.336
Previously on Return.

2
00:00:09.167 --> 00:00:11.667
Should we bury her in an isolated place?

3
00:00:12.938 --> 00:00:13.938
Help!

4
00:00:14.141 --> 00:00:17.081
You are under arrest for murdering and abandoning the body of Ms. Yum.

5
00:00:17.081 --> 00:00:18.481
Ja Hye. I need your help.

6
00:00:18.481 --> 00:00:20.581
I will prove his innocence.

7
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.691
Did you confirm the body was his?

8
00:00:27.691 --> 00:00:29.421
Can you get in touch with Mr. Kim?

9
00:00:31.821 --> 00:00:33.991
Do you really not want to find your son?

10
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.171
(Episode 9)

11
00:00:46.341 --> 00:00:48.271
What were you talking about on the phone?

12
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:49.980
Here you go.

13
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.080
Who is this?

14
00:00:54.351 --> 00:00:55.351
It's Seo Joon Hee.

15
00:00:57.351 --> 00:00:58.750
Joon Hee is alive.

16
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.400
I have the DNA test result.

17
00:01:15.301 --> 00:01:18.040
The body in the car wreck isn't Seo Joon Hee.

18
00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:21.540
I'm on my way to Daemyung Hospital to see his father.

19
00:01:27.351 --> 00:01:28.480
The weather is nice today.

20
00:01:35.551 --> 00:01:36.661
Where could he be?

21
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.721
Actually,

22
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.430
I'm more curious who sent this with what intention.

23
00:01:43.301 --> 00:01:44.560
Is this the only photo in the camera?

24
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.801
I didn't check.

25
00:01:46.361 --> 00:01:48.530
That photo was the first thing I saw when I opened the box.

26
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.670
I didn't know what to think.

27
00:01:52.801 --> 00:01:54.870
There's a video too.

28
00:01:55.571 --> 00:01:56.611
Sorry?

29
00:02:31.441 --> 00:02:32.441
Hello.

30
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.080
You want to sell this car?

31
00:02:37.251 --> 00:02:39.221
Why? Can't I sell it?

32
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.950
Of course you can, but it's strange since you love that car.

33
00:02:43.151 --> 00:02:46.730
I just want to sell it. It's time I grew up too.

34
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.031
My gosh.

35
00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:03.411
Hello, sir.

36
00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:05.710
Hello.

37
00:03:06.781 --> 00:03:08.480
Get out. We need to talk.

38
00:03:13.621 --> 00:03:14.990
How much would you like for that?

39
00:03:15.191 --> 00:03:18.061
I don't care about the price. Just sell it quickly.

40
00:03:18.061 --> 00:03:22.031
Come on. You won't get a lot of money if you sell it in a hurry.

41
00:03:22.631 --> 00:03:25.061
I'm sure you're not selling it for the money.

42
00:03:27.471 --> 00:03:30.300
I'm sorry. Curiosity got the better of me.

43
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.110
My gosh, I'm becoming nosy as I get older.

44
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.811
I keep slipping out and asking questions.

45
00:03:35.811 --> 00:03:37.781
You're not slipping out.

46
00:03:38.381 --> 00:03:39.781
You're making a fool of yourself.

47
00:03:40.681 --> 00:03:45.251
Differentiate being my friend from stepping out of your place.

48
00:03:45.781 --> 00:03:47.020
You jerk.

49
00:03:48.191 --> 00:03:51.191
I will keep that in mind. I will, sir.

50
00:03:55.161 --> 00:03:57.531
Should I call you a taxi? Would you like a VIP taxi?

51
00:03:59.401 --> 00:04:00.471
Or a black cab?

52
00:04:03.101 --> 00:04:04.341
I'll drive it for a few days.

53
00:04:04.341 --> 00:04:06.710
Sorry? Oh, okay.

54
00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:10.580
- My gosh, seriously? - I'm sorry.

55
00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.191
That stupid jerk...

56
00:04:26.991 --> 00:04:28.090
How dare he?

57
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.960
That peanut-sized jerk. I'm going to kill him.

58
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.340
If I win the lottery, I'll buy a gun with a silencer.

59
00:04:40.171 --> 00:04:43.140
And after that, I'm going to kill that jerk, Kim Hak Bum, first.

60
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.441
Did you forget that you're the one who let him walk all over you?

61
00:04:46.441 --> 00:04:47.910
What choice did I have?

62
00:04:49.381 --> 00:04:51.621
30 percent of my sales is from that punk.

63
00:04:51.621 --> 00:04:56.450
Then you can't complain even if he treats you like a dog.

64
00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.660
By the way, what did he and his friends do to make things ugly?

65
00:05:01.691 --> 00:05:03.330
What are you talking about?

66
00:05:04.301 --> 00:05:05.330
Do you really not know?

67
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.131
Rachel from the wine bar died.

68
00:05:10.041 --> 00:05:12.001
- What? - Then you probably don't know this.

69
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.410
The suspect of Rachel's murder...

70
00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.010
is Kang In Ho.

71
00:05:18.441 --> 00:05:19.881
Not the Kang In Ho of Taeha, right?

72
00:05:20.481 --> 00:05:23.321
You'd pass out if you found out Seo Joon Hee is dead too.

73
00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:24.921
What happened to him?

74
00:05:24.981 --> 00:05:27.621
Seriously. Cut down on drinking and shooting yourself up.

75
00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.191
You've been living so diligently in your own world...

76
00:05:30.191 --> 00:05:31.991
that you separated yourself from the everyday world.

77
00:05:32.061 --> 00:05:35.530
Come on. Stop nagging, and just tell me. I need details.

78
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.561
I don't know the details either.

79
00:05:37.561 --> 00:05:40.030
I only know that he fell off a cliff in Gangwon Province.

80
00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.770
You know there was a rumor that something was going on...

81
00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.001
between Rachel and the four of them.

82
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.741
So rumors say they killed each other over Rachel too.

83
00:05:49.881 --> 00:05:50.881
That's so creepy.

84
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.051
No way.

85
00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:57.780
Hold on.

86
00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:00.691
Then is that why...

87
00:06:02.191 --> 00:06:03.590
that detective visited me the other day?

88
00:06:13.371 --> 00:06:15.131
The director is not in the office at the moment.

89
00:06:15.431 --> 00:06:17.340
You didn't schedule an appointment, right?

90
00:06:17.501 --> 00:06:21.470
I have urgent news for him regarding Seo Joon Hee's death.

91
00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:23.340
Why don't you give him a call?

92
00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:25.741
He left 10 minutes ago for an appointment.

93
00:06:25.741 --> 00:06:28.111
His son's death. Urgent news.

94
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:31.621
Does he have any business important than what I just mentioned?

95
00:06:43.361 --> 00:06:44.361
Yes.

96
00:06:54.111 --> 00:06:56.111
I was led to think you were with a guest.

97
00:06:56.111 --> 00:06:57.580
The guest hasn't arrived yet.

98
00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:00.111
But what brings you here today?

99
00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:02.681
This is about your son.

100
00:07:03.981 --> 00:07:06.791
Do you have Joon Hee's...

101
00:07:07.191 --> 00:07:09.251
DNA test result?

102
00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:17.400
(DNA test result)

103
00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.030
(Mismatch)

104
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.431
I'm sure you understand the result better than me.

105
00:07:23.071 --> 00:07:24.671
So I won't need to explain it to you.

106
00:07:28.741 --> 00:07:31.481
Is this true?

107
00:07:31.611 --> 00:07:34.150
Unless someone intercepted and manipulated it on purpose.

108
00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:36.681
Then where's my son?

109
00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:39.051
I must start looking for Seo Joon Hee now.

110
00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:47.030
Then whose body is the corpse?

111
00:07:47.191 --> 00:07:48.561
A hospital in Gangwon Province...

112
00:07:56.171 --> 00:07:58.371
Please continue.

113
00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:04.941
Excuse me for a moment.

114
00:08:26.571 --> 00:08:30.270
In movies, someone is always eavesdropping behind a door.

115
00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:31.340
So...

116
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.771
what on earth happened?

117
00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:41.380
I cannot discuss it since the case is still under investigation.

118
00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:43.521
I will come back another time.

119
00:08:54.191 --> 00:08:56.130
- Excuse me. - Yes?

120
00:08:56.191 --> 00:09:00.100
The guest with Mr. Seo Chan Jong in Plum Blossom Room...

121
00:09:00.531 --> 00:09:02.470
I can't seem to remember the name all of a sudden.

122
00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.141
Are you referring to Mr. Oh Tae Suk?

123
00:09:06.401 --> 00:09:07.411
That's right.

124
00:09:08.411 --> 00:09:10.840
Did Mr. Oh Tae Suk go to the restroom?

125
00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.340
Wasn't he in the room?

126
00:09:13.041 --> 00:09:14.551
I didn't see him leave the room.

127
00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:18.880
A hospital in Gangwon Province...

128
00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.360
I see.

129
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Did you have a good talk?

130
00:09:34.901 --> 00:09:36.600
You could have stayed.

131
00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.700
You didn't have to clear your meal away.

132
00:09:39.671 --> 00:09:41.541
My presence could have made him feel uncomfortable.

133
00:09:42.271 --> 00:09:45.181
You heard what the detective said too, right?

134
00:09:47.511 --> 00:09:50.921
I don't know what's going on.

135
00:09:51.181 --> 00:09:52.220
I know.

136
00:10:00.391 --> 00:10:03.830
Oh Tae Suk. What's your deal?

137
00:10:20.281 --> 00:10:22.181
Have some coffee.

138
00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:27.120
Did you find anything?

139
00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:32.490
The flock of ducks.

140
00:10:34.061 --> 00:10:36.360
Look at the sunset.

141
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.370
Do you see the flock of ducks flying across?

142
00:10:40.571 --> 00:10:42.100
Those are ducks?

143
00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:45.801
Ducks? May I ask what you're talking about?

144
00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:47.541
Over there.

145
00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:50.011
I remember seeing...

146
00:10:50.011 --> 00:10:53.110
a flock of ducks flying up in front of a sunset...

147
00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:54.750
like a group dance before.

148
00:10:55.411 --> 00:10:57.651
Search for sightings of a flock of ducks...

149
00:10:58.051 --> 00:11:00.021
on the day of the video.

150
00:11:00.521 --> 00:11:01.651
Yes, ma'am.

151
00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:05.561
Ms. Geum. Listen to this.

152
00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:17.301
How is Mr. Seo Joon Hee today?

153
00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.141
Dr. Kang Sul Jin.

154
00:11:22.041 --> 00:11:23.380
Kang Sul Jin?

155
00:11:24.781 --> 00:11:28.181
It must be a medical doctor, since it's a hospital, right?

156
00:11:28.181 --> 00:11:29.880
We should search for a doctor...

157
00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.181
named Kang Sul Jin proximate the duck sightings.

158
00:11:32.181 --> 00:11:33.391
We should.

159
00:11:33.391 --> 00:11:36.220
Then why don't we ask Detective Dokgo for help...

160
00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:37.620
Watch some more first.

161
00:11:44.901 --> 00:11:47.230
(Gangdong Precinct)

162
00:11:54.541 --> 00:11:55.970
Who could it be?

163
00:12:00.011 --> 00:12:02.710
Na Ra. Don't trust anyone.

164
00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:07.151
Let's keep this video to ourselves.

165
00:12:10.691 --> 00:12:12.720
(Gangdong Precinct)

166
00:12:24.271 --> 00:12:25.470
Why did you order so much?

167
00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:30.340
But can you drink with that arm?

168
00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:34.850
It's just alcohol. Look. Look.

169
00:12:37.051 --> 00:12:38.380
I can pick it up with my left hand.

170
00:12:43.891 --> 00:12:45.821
Did you eat? You should eat.

171
00:12:45.821 --> 00:12:48.090
No. No, no. I'm fine.

172
00:12:48.431 --> 00:12:49.460
I'm not hungry.

173
00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:52.860
What was that about Seo Joon Hee?

174
00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:54.630
What else? It's as I said.

175
00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:56.230
- How's your uncle? - Pardon?

176
00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.541
Well... He's just...

177
00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:03.781
Darn it.

178
00:13:05.941 --> 00:13:08.811
You said your uncle raised you through high school.

179
00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:11.380
He's like your father. Visit him often.

180
00:13:12.551 --> 00:13:13.950
This is insane.

181
00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:15.990
It isn't much, really.

182
00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.061
Are you crying now?

183
00:13:22.891 --> 00:13:26.870
Punk. Why are you so touched? You're making me feel bad.

184
00:13:28.931 --> 00:13:30.240
I can't accept this.

185
00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:34.011
You have to repay your loan starting next year.

186
00:13:34.011 --> 00:13:35.240
Don't act tough.

187
00:13:36.641 --> 00:13:38.941
You like money. Why are you refusing it?

188
00:13:39.511 --> 00:13:41.011
Hey. It's okay.

189
00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:45.181
You can take money if it's from me. It's okay.

190
00:13:45.181 --> 00:13:46.651
Act tough somewhere else.

191
00:13:48.821 --> 00:13:50.120
I don't need it!

192
00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:53.291
Darn it.

193
00:13:53.791 --> 00:13:55.161
What are you doing?

194
00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:57.860
I said I won't take it. Why are you being like this?

195
00:13:59.301 --> 00:14:00.470
Forget it!

196
00:14:02.031 --> 00:14:03.240
Where are you going?

197
00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:05.141
I'm going to the bathroom.

198
00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:08.911
Darn it. The money got all wet.

199
00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:22.021
Hello. We have the best beer in the world.

200
00:14:22.021 --> 00:14:25.891
Hello! Hello. We have the best beer in the world.

201
00:14:25.921 --> 00:14:28.360
- Come on. - I'm not interested.

202
00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:29.830
Take a look, would you?

203
00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:34.401
You hurt your arm.

204
00:14:34.401 --> 00:14:37.600
You shouldn't drink when you're hurt. Goodnight.

205
00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.171
Please come when you're better.

206
00:14:39.171 --> 00:14:41.911
- Hello there. - It was at the scene.

207
00:14:43.041 --> 00:14:44.311
It's clean, right?

208
00:14:45.941 --> 00:14:49.350
It was within the remains of the car.

209
00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:51.950
- Isn't it strange? - There was a third party?

210
00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:54.021
I'm merely pointing out that we must think of every possibility.

211
00:14:54.021 --> 00:14:56.620
We have the best beer in the world.

212
00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:59.561
Just for you. Okay. Gosh.

213
00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.960
What is it? Beer?

214
00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:09.271
The badge.

215
00:15:12.771 --> 00:15:13.941
That's it.

216
00:15:14.771 --> 00:15:15.941
What is that?

217
00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:18.281
What this is doesn't matter.

218
00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:21.080
Whose this is matters.

219
00:15:25.781 --> 00:15:27.821
Find the owner within 12 hours.

220
00:15:30.391 --> 00:15:32.620
There were hardly any sightings...

221
00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:35.761
of a flock of ducks on the day of the video.

222
00:15:36.661 --> 00:15:40.000
But I posted a request online,

223
00:15:41.171 --> 00:15:42.330
and I got a response.

224
00:15:44.441 --> 00:15:46.441
These are Baikal teals.

225
00:15:46.441 --> 00:15:48.941
Are they similar to the video?

226
00:15:49.041 --> 00:15:51.041
They do look similar.

227
00:15:51.041 --> 00:15:52.441
Where was this taken?

228
00:15:52.911 --> 00:15:54.980
The person hasn't replied yet.

229
00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:56.620
But if you look at the bottom of the photo,

230
00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:59.151
it says, "At the reservoir."

231
00:16:00.651 --> 00:16:02.990
Let's look for Baikal teal habitats...

232
00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:05.321
that are near a reservoir.

233
00:16:09.031 --> 00:16:11.460
It took you exactly 10 hours and 40 minutes.

234
00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:14.931
I sent a photo of the badge to all badge manufacturers,

235
00:16:14.931 --> 00:16:16.641
and I got a response this morning.

236
00:16:16.641 --> 00:16:19.071
It's a large advertisement company in Gangwon-do.

237
00:16:19.071 --> 00:16:20.541
Okay then. Let's go.

238
00:16:22.071 --> 00:16:23.110
Where's your car?

239
00:16:27.181 --> 00:16:29.781
I got one that was modestly priced.

240
00:16:31.681 --> 00:16:33.990
You don't even have money.

241
00:16:34.321 --> 00:16:36.250
It may be a little old,

242
00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:38.391
but it rolls, so don't worry.

243
00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:42.090
You're working so hard, down to your final days.

244
00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:44.230
Thanks for your hard work.

245
00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:47.130
This is the start of our beautiful relationship.

246
00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:53.240
Darn it.

247
00:16:53.541 --> 00:16:55.271
Can we actually leave today?

248
00:16:55.271 --> 00:16:56.740
What's wrong with it?

249
00:16:58.641 --> 00:17:01.710
Don't abuse it. Let's take some time.

250
00:17:05.551 --> 00:17:08.491
Anyway, where did you find that badge?

251
00:17:08.751 --> 00:17:10.491
At the site of Seo Joon Hee's accident.

252
00:17:12.521 --> 00:17:14.360
The killer probably dropped it.

253
00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:17.100
Do you think Yum Mi Jung's killer...

254
00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:20.001
hid Seo Joon Hee?

255
00:17:21.701 --> 00:17:23.201
What an odd question.

256
00:17:23.201 --> 00:17:25.600
- It may be someone else. - Why?

257
00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:30.410
Just... Well... Still...

258
00:17:30.781 --> 00:17:33.650
"Just, well, and still"?

259
00:17:34.811 --> 00:17:37.451
Is that all you learned from those four years with me?

260
00:17:37.451 --> 00:17:39.350
I'm just saying other possibilities...

261
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:41.350
A man who said he'd clear the prime suspect...

262
00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:43.021
of a murder charge...

263
00:17:43.021 --> 00:17:46.321
was dragged away by an unknown man in front of a police station.

264
00:17:46.531 --> 00:17:48.590
Then four days later,

265
00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:51.501
his unidentifiable body was found at the site of a car accident.

266
00:17:53.201 --> 00:17:55.031
The DNA test says...

267
00:17:55.031 --> 00:17:57.241
that corpse wasn't his.

268
00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:00.311
The bodies were switched.

269
00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:03.380
Why? Because he's alive.

270
00:18:05.481 --> 00:18:07.981
The fact that a witness who knows the secret is alive...

271
00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:10.451
must intimidate the real killer.

272
00:18:11.981 --> 00:18:14.521
He'll try to either kill or hide Seo Joon Hee. Right?

273
00:18:14.521 --> 00:18:15.751
Then he would've killed him.

274
00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:19.721
There's no reason to switch bodies and keep him alive.

275
00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:22.491
What are you trying to say?

276
00:18:22.761 --> 00:18:25.501
I... I'm just saying that I think...

277
00:18:28.731 --> 00:18:29.771
Never mind.

278
00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:36.170
Okay, let's go.

279
00:18:39.694 --> 00:18:44.694
<font color="#fcc89b">[VIU Ver] E09 Return "The Flock of Ducks"</font>
<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

280
00:18:48.051 --> 00:18:50.390
- Are you here from Seoul? - Yes.

281
00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:53.630
I looked for it ahead of time since you were coming.

282
00:18:53.991 --> 00:18:55.930
My memory served me right.

283
00:18:56.531 --> 00:18:58.761
- Is this what you're looking for? - Yes.

284
00:18:58.761 --> 00:19:00.301
I looked into it,

285
00:19:00.301 --> 00:19:02.100
and mid-sized hospitals in Gangwon-do...

286
00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:05.041
had an event for children with heart disease.

287
00:19:05.201 --> 00:19:06.741
That's what this badge was made for.

288
00:19:08.071 --> 00:19:11.080
Do you know which hospitals participated?

289
00:19:14.951 --> 00:19:17.551
Inje Hospital. Sincerity Hospital.

290
00:19:17.551 --> 00:19:19.120
Gyeongchun Hospital...

291
00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:21.120
Gyeongchun Hospital.

292
00:19:22.951 --> 00:19:24.160
Gyeongchun Hospital?

293
00:19:26.731 --> 00:19:29.830
How could a body disappear from a hospital morgue?

294
00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:32.761
That's right.

295
00:19:32.761 --> 00:19:35.231
He said a body disappeared from a morgue.

296
00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:40.971
Anyway, did Dong Bae fall into the toilet or something?

297
00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:45.541
- The phone is turned off. - Come on, Dong Bae.

298
00:20:14.071 --> 00:20:15.370
Look at that, Mom.

299
00:20:16.271 --> 00:20:17.311
It's so fast.

300
00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:20.951
Dad, trains are faster than airplanes, right?

301
00:20:21.511 --> 00:20:24.080
I doubt it. I'm sure airplanes are faster than trains.

302
00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:27.890
No. Mom, trains are faster, aren't they?

303
00:20:32.321 --> 00:20:35.860
- No, airplanes are faster, sweetie. - No, trains are faster.

304
00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.961
- No, airplanes are. - No, trains are.

305
00:20:38.001 --> 00:20:39.001
No, airplanes are.

306
00:20:56.721 --> 00:21:00.051
Let's talk about Yum Mi Jung a bit more.

307
00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:02.390
I already explained everything about our relationship.

308
00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:04.791
It wasn't anything more than an affair.

309
00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:08.590
She was a high school graduate and a daughter of your chauffeur.

310
00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:12.501
A woman in her 30s without previous incomes...

311
00:21:12.501 --> 00:21:14.630
ran a high-end wine bar.

312
00:21:15.271 --> 00:21:18.701
She even ran her wine bar in the center of Cheongdam-dong...

313
00:21:18.701 --> 00:21:20.610
where the land value is most expensive in Seoul.

314
00:21:20.811 --> 00:21:24.041
I guess the wine bar is still running without the owner.

315
00:21:24.041 --> 00:21:26.110
We have to stay open until the bar is sold.

316
00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:28.110
The store itself costs more than 20,000 dollars.

317
00:21:28.811 --> 00:21:29.920
There's no other way.

318
00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:32.680
Those bottles are expensive too.

319
00:21:32.721 --> 00:21:35.021
1 of them costs more than 30,000 dollars.

320
00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:37.461
Who manages this bar?

321
00:21:37.561 --> 00:21:39.660
I run the bar,

322
00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:42.231
but someone else comes to manage it.

323
00:21:43.061 --> 00:21:44.100
I don't know much.

324
00:21:44.701 --> 00:21:47.301
I only know that he's the one who put in the money for the bar.

325
00:21:47.301 --> 00:21:49.231
(Director Kang In Ho, Taeha Group)

326
00:21:49.231 --> 00:21:50.471
Is that person you, Mr. Kang?

327
00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:52.440
It's not me.

328
00:21:53.311 --> 00:21:57.311
Then does it mean that someone else is sponsoring her? Or...

329
00:21:57.511 --> 00:21:58.511
He just...

330
00:21:59.711 --> 00:22:02.180
He just gives her the money.

331
00:22:02.281 --> 00:22:03.551
So who is he?

332
00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:07.521
Is... Is that really important now?

333
00:22:13.531 --> 00:22:17.301
It's not possible that you've forgotten that you're arrested...

334
00:22:17.301 --> 00:22:21.370
and investigated for the murder of Yum Mi Jung, right?

335
00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:34.110
It's Mr. Oh, the chairman of Sunwoo Group.

336
00:22:38.281 --> 00:22:39.650
He's Tae Suk's father.

337
00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:43.261
(Sunwoo Group)

338
00:22:43.261 --> 00:22:46.291
(Sunwoo Group)

339
00:22:46.291 --> 00:22:47.291
Where are you?

340
00:22:48.231 --> 00:22:49.231
Home.

341
00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:52.531
What about the car? You took care of it, right?

342
00:22:52.531 --> 00:22:54.231
Yes, I took care of it.

343
00:22:54.801 --> 00:22:56.471
Don't drink or hook up for the time being. Got that?

344
00:22:56.471 --> 00:22:59.571
Are you my mother? How many times are you going to nag me?

345
00:22:59.971 --> 00:23:00.971
Are you sure you're at home now?

346
00:23:00.971 --> 00:23:04.410
Yes, I'm at home. Where else? You told me to lie low for now.

347
00:23:05.511 --> 00:23:07.880
Hang up already. I'm going to the gym.

348
00:23:08.281 --> 00:23:09.311
That too.

349
00:23:10.281 --> 00:23:12.781
Don't go to the gym. Steer clear of crowded places for now.

350
00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:14.551
Okay. I got it.

351
00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:18.291
- What are you doing? Come already. - You moron.

352
00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:20.890
Who is that?

353
00:23:21.031 --> 00:23:22.930
What are you talking about? Darn it.

354
00:23:23.801 --> 00:23:26.930
Hey, I can't hear you well. Yes.

355
00:23:27.071 --> 00:23:28.271
Don't pull that on me.

356
00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:30.241
Be at the penthouse in 20 minutes.

357
00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.170
Hey, I can't hear you.

358
00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:36.271
Okay. My gosh, my phone just fell into the water.

359
00:23:36.271 --> 00:23:39.741
It just dropped. Darn it. I can't talk to you anymore.

360
00:23:41.711 --> 00:23:43.920
Stop lying over there. Come clean this up.

361
00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:47.451
I don't think this is the place either.

362
00:23:48.321 --> 00:23:51.190
The flock of ducks is too far away from the building.

363
00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:53.330
I can barely see them on the rooftop.

364
00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:54.860
What about you?

365
00:23:55.531 --> 00:23:58.600
It's about the same where I am too.

366
00:23:58.701 --> 00:24:03.001
I don't see any hospitals where you can see the reservoir.

367
00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.271
It's harder than I thought.

368
00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:09.211
I think that online user made a false report just to earn points.

369
00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:12.811
What do you plan to do next?

370
00:24:12.811 --> 00:24:14.011
We should return to Seoul.

371
00:24:14.311 --> 00:24:15.311
Okay.

372
00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:42.610
My gosh. Seriously.

373
00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:49.251
Shoot.

374
00:24:50.521 --> 00:24:52.420
He must have gone mad. I bet that's what it is.

375
00:24:53.521 --> 00:24:55.751
Is he feeling rebellious again or what?

376
00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:57.721
How does he expect me to drive?

377
00:25:15.541 --> 00:25:17.880
You're unbelievable, Dong Bae. Goodness.

378
00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:41.231
You're right. It was Gyeongchun Hospital.

379
00:25:42.201 --> 00:25:44.771
The hospital reported that a corpse went missing.

380
00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:48.471
By the way, what brings...

381
00:25:49.271 --> 00:25:50.311
a detective from Seoul here?

382
00:25:50.981 --> 00:25:51.981
I'm not sure.

383
00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:55.180
Why did a detective from Seoul come all the way here?

384
00:25:57.551 --> 00:25:58.650
Anyway, thank you.

385
00:26:11.201 --> 00:26:12.561
We should take a break too.

386
00:26:31.221 --> 00:26:34.051
Let's forget about everything at least for this very moment...

387
00:26:35.021 --> 00:26:36.021
and rest.

388
00:26:36.821 --> 00:26:39.390
Both of us should.

389
00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:16.850
Are you feeling better now?

390
00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:22.920
You saw me hit rock bottom.

391
00:29:25.521 --> 00:29:27.791
You must have had an easy life...

392
00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:30.630
if you think you hit rock bottom now.

393
00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:35.771
You shouldn't make rash comments. You don't know what it's like.

394
00:29:37.201 --> 00:29:38.471
I'm sorry if I offended you.

395
00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:42.170
It's just what I learned about life.

396
00:29:42.571 --> 00:29:44.781
There's no limit to how low you can fall.

397
00:29:57.321 --> 00:29:59.360
What is Oh Tae Suk like?

398
00:30:03.061 --> 00:30:04.630
He's polite,

399
00:30:06.001 --> 00:30:08.731
and he is respectful even to people below him.

400
00:30:09.571 --> 00:30:10.801
He's a good person.

401
00:30:17.711 --> 00:30:19.110
Why are you laughing like that?

402
00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:24.880
I don't know how I was laughing, but one thing is for sure.

403
00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:30.390
Tomorrow, we must meet with Oh Tae Suk.

404
00:30:47.011 --> 00:30:49.571
- What is it? - Did you sleep here?

405
00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:53.951
- As you can see. - Are you going to Seoul?

406
00:30:54.551 --> 00:30:56.451
No. To Gyeongchun Hospital.

407
00:30:56.451 --> 00:30:58.420
You won't find anything there.

408
00:30:58.751 --> 00:31:01.321
We checked all the CCTVs,

409
00:31:01.551 --> 00:31:03.190
but there was nothing suspicious.

410
00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:13.771
(Gyeongchun Hospital)

411
00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:20.211
I owe you one.

412
00:31:20.211 --> 00:31:21.511
Not at all.

413
00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:24.840
The missing body was a headache for us too.

414
00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:26.781
Please find something.

415
00:31:27.410 --> 00:31:29.251
I'll take a nap out here then.

416
00:31:36.761 --> 00:31:37.890
Excuse me.

417
00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:41.930
- Hello? - Is Dong Bae with you?

418
00:31:42.231 --> 00:31:43.461
No, why?

419
00:31:43.461 --> 00:31:45.061
The higher ups are looking for him.

420
00:31:45.061 --> 00:31:47.600
He turned his phone off and went off the grid.

421
00:31:48.471 --> 00:31:50.370
- What is it? - You didn't know either, did you?

422
00:31:50.741 --> 00:31:51.971
Dong Bae...

423
00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:55.211
must've been caught for taking a bribe.

424
00:31:55.211 --> 00:31:57.580
What are you talking about?

425
00:31:57.580 --> 00:31:59.880
He took money from an illegal gambling house,

426
00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:02.610
and somehow, the higher ups must have found out.

427
00:32:04.221 --> 00:32:05.551
That unlucky punk.

428
00:32:07.751 --> 00:32:08.920
Okay. I'll look for him.

429
00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:14.090
That stupid punk. Seriously.

430
00:32:18.461 --> 00:32:20.071
- Let's look at that again. - Okay.

431
00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:24.900
Just a minute.

432
00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:27.940
Rewind five seconds, please.

433
00:32:30.511 --> 00:32:31.511
Stop.

434
00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:44.360
Do you think Yum Mi Jung's killer...

435
00:32:45.221 --> 00:32:47.160
hid Seo Joon Hee?

436
00:32:51.284 --> 00:32:54.684
(Episode 10 will air shortly.)
