00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.730
<i>right?</i>

4
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.460
<i>Of course. I said I'd support you.</i>

5
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.550
<i>Just don't hurt yourself.</i>

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.640

RESTRICTED

10
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.210
I visit often, so don't worry.

11
00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.760
Plus, Jailbird had adjusted already.

12
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.640
He's the best at doing indoor labor.

13

SEGREGATION CELL 3

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.620
Officer! Please give me
200 more shopping bags!

17
00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.090
See you later.

18
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.010
What did you say, you bastard?
Say that again.

19
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.930
Seriously.

20
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.060
I said to say it again.

21
00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:26.350
I said my tax money pays your salaries.

22
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.190
It's because I commit crimes

23
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.690
and come in here,
that you people have jobs.

24
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.570
You should be grateful.

25
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.200
Have you gone nuts?

26
00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.910
I've gone nuts, you son of a bitch.

27
00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.280
What was that?

28
00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:42.910
You bastard. Watch it!

29
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.960
You bastard! You think
the guards are fools, don't you?

30
00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.460
-You son of a...
-Stop it already.

31
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.170
Let go. Let go of me! Let go!

32
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.420
-I said to stop.
-Didn't you hear that bastard?

33
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.170
-Let go.
-Stop it.

34
00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:55.670
-You son of a bitch.
-Okay, okay.

35
00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:59.600
I don't want it.

36
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.230
It's not his first time.

37
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.270
You know that's how he is.

38
00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.360
Just let him bark away. Ignore him.
Why do you let him get to you?

39
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.400
You're the one who suffers.

40
00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.700
I'm saying this for you.

41
00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.490
He says crap like,
"Son of a bitch," "Psycho bastard,"

42
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.240
and "Serve me right," to my face.

43
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.830
Should I go, "Yes, sir, I'm sorry, sir"?
Is that what you do?

44
00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.420
Yes, that's what I do.

45
00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.130
I let them curse.

46
00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:31.210
It's not worth it.

47
00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.340
Why do you get emotional
with jerks like him?

48
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.720
Just ignore them.

49
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.760
Is it that easy? You can do that?

50
00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.600
Yes. I can!

51
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.440
Everyone go inside! Go inside.

52
00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:10.880
TRANSPORTATION CARD

53
00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.460
-Right.
-Here's your cut.

54
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:15.590
Thank you.

55
00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:19.970
It's all chump change
without the druggies.

56
00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.010
So, who's the next target?

57
00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:27.310
Captain Yoo.

58
00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.640
He's staying invisible
because of his retrial.

59
00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:35.230
Turns out Je-hyeok Kim is surrounded
by bastards who can't do shit.

60
00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:38.900
Are you sure he even cares?

61
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.780
Let's just drag him out
and put a knife to his throat.

62
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:47.370
No.

63
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.370
We can just cut off a finger.

64
00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.170
We'll cut off one a day
and ask for a billion won.

65
00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.090
That won't work on him.

66
00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:01.050
He goes insane in an instant.

67
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.470
My method is better.

68
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:06.350
Trust me.

69
00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:14.980
I should've attacked his friends
to start with instead of wasting my time.

70
00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:20.650
But Boss,

71
00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:23.160
I don't see one of your punks.

72
00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.450
He's in the hospital.

73
00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:31.830
He messed with my money,
so I sliced his Achilles tendon,

74
00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:33.920
and now, he can't walk.

75
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.920
I can't trust anyone. Not anyone.

76
00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:44.890
Sang-jae.

77
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.100
I can't trust anyone anymore.

78
00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:50.720
Right?

79
00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:00.030
This came to my house yesterday,

80
00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:02.700
saying he'll kill me if I testify,

81
00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:05.030
and to watch out for cars.

82
00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:09.870
The moment you testify, you die.

83
00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:14.870
Sang-yun got the same letter.

84
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:18.420
I'm fine, but he's terrified.

85
00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:21.420
It must be Sergeant Oh.

86
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:26.260
No. They're not amateurs.

87
00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:28.760
He's being investigated
for committing perjury right now.

88
00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:32.390
These things would hurt them more.

89
00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:36.400
Who could it be?

90
00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.980
Who's doing this?

91
00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:49.580
Is something wrong?

92
00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:55.750
Jeong-hun and Sang-yun,
who agreed to testify for me,

93
00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.000
received death threat letters.

94
00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:03.130
What? Who was it?
It was Sergeant Oh, wasn't it?

95
00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:05.340
They checked with his people,

96
00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.260
and they say it wasn't them.

97
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:11.510
Of course, they deny it.
Why would they admit it?

98
00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.600
Those dirty rotten rats.

99
00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:22.150
<i>What grade are you in now?</i>

100
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:23.730
I'll be a senior next year.

101
00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.860
I do really well in school.
I received a scholarship too.

102
00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:28.570
Is that right?

103
00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:30.620
You must get it from your mom...

104
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.450
No. Your mom was terrible in school too.

105
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:40.920
-So, what are you studying?
-Business administration.

106
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:43.420
I want to work for a securities firm.

107
00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.800
I have two certifications already,

108
00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.340
as a financial analyst
and an investment manager.

109
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:53.010
That's so cool. Nice. You did great.

110
00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:55.930
My daughter is awesome.

111
00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:00.650
Is there anything you want to do?

112
00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.440
Me?

113
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:06.990
Well, I'm so ignorant.

114
00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:10.410
I'm not good with my hands either.

115
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:13.740
I don't know if I can do anything right.

116
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:17.450
I heard people collect several
certifications while they're here.

117
00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.620
That's true. I have some too.

118
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:23.880
But not that many. Maybe like 50?

119
00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:25.500
What?

120
00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:29.930
Data processing, furniture construction,

121
00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:34.140
plastic craftsmanship,
automobile repair...

122
00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:35.640
Wow.

123
00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:42.480
Machine repair,
boiler construction and repair.

124
00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:44.650
What else is there?

125
00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:48.110
Industrial engineering in horticulture,
industrial engineering in architecture,

126
00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:51.660
forklift operation, heat management,

127
00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:56.080
high-pressure gas management,
mushroom seed production,

128
00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:59.580
casting and mold making,
washing machine repair.

129
00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:01.920
How many certifications do you have?

130
00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:06.000
You got 700 on the TOEIC test?

131
00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:09.090
Yeah. I speak a little English.

132
00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:13.140
You'll make tons of money
once you get out.

133
00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.220
You can pick one of these jobs.

134
00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:20.480
But I don't know how to do any of these.

135
00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:25.060
I have all these certifications,
but I didn't actually do any of them.

136
00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:27.110
They're all pieces of paper.

137
00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:30.190
You had a lot of business ideas.

138
00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:32.650
You can do that. What are your ideas?

139
00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:36.450
You should lend him some money
to start his business.

140
00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:38.700
No. Why should I?

141
00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.540
I'll invest. Invest.

142
00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.500
I'll invest in your business.

143
00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.210
I'll listen to your business idea

144
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:49.760
and invest 100% in it.

145
00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.760
They aren't grand enough
to call it a "business idea."

146
00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:56.300
Do you want to hear it anyway?

147
00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:03.100
So, rather than packed foods,

148
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:07.940
you bring food on a truck
and cook right there.

149
00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:11.110
I hear there are hundreds of people there

150
00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:13.110
when they film dramas and stuff.

151
00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:17.530
They can't all eat packed foods
all the time, right?

152
00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.540
So, you bring food on that truck,

153
00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:25.170
and give them soup, rice,
and side dishes and stuff.

154
00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:26.290
A food truck?

155
00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:31.210
What a good name. "Food truck."
"Food truck" sounds good.

156
00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:34.260
You've got a good sense for these things.

157
00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:39.010
Min-chul, that came out
over ten years ago.

158
00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:40.600
Really?

159
00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:46.770
Spicy rice cakes.

160
00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:50.610
It'll be a spicy rice cake business
that the entire nation loves,

161
00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:52.320
but we'll use my expertise.

162
00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:53.990
How?

163
00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:55.570
I'll throw it into the name.

164
00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:59.990
Your name...
"Min-chul Kim's Spicy Rice Cakes"?

165
00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.910
No. My previous job.

166
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.830
We'll put my origin into the name.

167
00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:07.120
-"Gangster."
-Wow.

168
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.880
This punk... He must be a genius.

169
00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.170
He's... He's getting it all.

170
00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:14.300
No way.

171
00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.090
"Gangster Spicy Rice Cakes."

172
00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:19.090
What do you think about that?

173
00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:21.680
It's a perfect match with my image.

174
00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:26.180
And I want to open it in Hongdae,
where all the young people hang out.

175
00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:28.850
There's one in Hongdae already.

176
00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:33.030
That's a lie.

177
00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:37.240
Gangster Spicy Rice Cakes
opened in Hongdae a while ago.

178
00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:39.780
I went several times
with my girlfriend too.

179
00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:41.620
Oh no, untouchable.

180
00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.870
It's "unbelievable."

181
00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:45.950
Is it?

182
00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:47.910
You said you got 700 on the TOEIC.

183
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.120
Oops.

184
00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:57.090
Okay, this is really my last one.

185
00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.890
I really didn't want to tell you this one.

186
00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:07.020
You know I love movies, right?

187
00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:12.690
You guys know I love...

188
00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:19.780
Let me tell you, at least. Hear me out.

189
00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.240
Okay.

190
00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:24.330
Every time I watched a movie,

191
00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:29.790
I thought about how nice it would be

192
00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:33.000
if the bullet that Yun-fat Chow shot
would come at me.

193
00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:35.670
When Yun-fat Chow is fighting and stuff,

194
00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:38.090
wouldn't it be so cool

195
00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:41.130
if he were fighting in front of me?

196
00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:44.260
How realistic would that be?
I used to think that.

197
00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:46.100
Please.

198
00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.270
You put glasses on them.

199
00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:55.230
Magic glasses. They will be magic glasses.

200
00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:59.860
If you wear these, every person,

201
00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:04.990
animal, rat, horse, cow...
everything jumps out at you.

202
00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:10.210
What do you think?
Isn't that an incredible idea?

203
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:12.040
But...

204
00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:16.920
the technology.
I don't know if the technology will work.

205
00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:22.050
If I can get the technology to work,
it would be a goldmine, right?

206
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:25.550
That came out...

207
00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:27.560
a while ago.

208
00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:31.180
Nowadays, they also provide

209
00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:34.020
wind, water, and scents too.

210
00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.900
Wind and water too?

211
00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:41.070
Yes.

212
00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.570
You bastard. Don't lie to me.

213
00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:48.200
How dare you mess with me, you punk?

214
00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:49.330
I'm not...

215
00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:54.710
They have them at 4D theaters.

216
00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:57.710
You bastard. You son of a bitch.

217
00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.340
That's crazy talk.

218
00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:01.970
What? Four what? Don't give me that crap.

219
00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:04.930
-Seriously...
-What? Why? Why?

220
00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:09.180
-There's no theater like that!
-I'll lose my hair!

221
00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:15.850
When an adult is talking,

222
00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:18.480
you just say, "Yes, sir," with respect!

223
00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:23.360
Get over here.

224
00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.030
<i>Mealtime!</i>

225
00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:29.200
98.

226
00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.160
99.

227
00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:34.500
100. Je-hyeok, stop now.

228
00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:36.710
I need to pee and I'm hungry.

229
00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:37.790
-Okay.
-Good.

230
00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:38.920
101.

231
00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:41.250
102.

232
00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:44.260
103.

233
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:46.890
104.

234
00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:48.850
105.

235
00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:50.890
-Captain Yoo.
-106.

236
00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:53.810
107.

237
00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:55.770
108.

238
00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:00.110
What did Officer Song want?
Is something up?

239
00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:01.860
They're inspecting cells tonight.

240
00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:03.400
What?

241
00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:05.200
They're inspecting cells tonight.

242
00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:06.740
What?

243
00:17:06.830 --> 00:17:09.620
Why are you so shocked?
Do you have something on you?

244
00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.750
No, it's a habit.

245
00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:18.000
It's relaxing, now that we don't have
Munrae or Looney.

246
00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:20.340
We have nothing to get caught with.

247
00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:24.260
-You cleaned the inside, right?
-I did.

248
00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:24.530
Whose bag is that?

249
00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:25.950
It's mine.

250
00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:28.030
It's my bag.

251
00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:31.830
What bastard did this? Huh?

252
00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:54.470
Boss.

253
00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:57.520
Was it those bastards?

254
00:18:57.770 --> 00:18:59.230
Which bastards?

255
00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:01.940
Chief Yeom?

256
00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:04.400
-That bastard wants to die.
-Min-chul.

257
00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:07.320
Don't do anything. Please.
Don't do anything.

258
00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:10.410
You'll get out soon by special pardon.

259
00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:12.160
Don't do anything.

260
00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:14.950
You too.

261
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.910
Don't lose your temper, and stay still.

262
00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:21.210
And I'm sorry.

263
00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:24.420
I'm sorry.

264
00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:27.470
I think Chief Yeom is the one

265
00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:30.300
threatening your witnesses.

266
00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:36.600
I'm very sorry.

267
00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:40.850
I'm very sorry...

268
00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:43.190
to all of you.

269
00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:46.150
That son of a bitch.

270
00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:50.990
I'll take care of it.

271
00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:53.200
I'll handle it.

272
00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:55.160
Handle what?

273
00:19:56.910 --> 00:19:57.950
Don't do it.

274
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.290
We're fine, so don't do anything.

275
00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:08.970
I can get out next year or the year after.

276
00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:10.680
I don't care.

277
00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:14.600
Je-hyeok, we're fine,

278
00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:17.600
so you need to keep it together. Okay?

279
00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:21.390
You're almost there.
You're almost there, Je-hyeok.

280
00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:24.480
You have less than two months left.
Hold it in, okay?

281
00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:30.150
It's dirty and maddening,
but let's hold it in.

282
00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:33.200
Jeong-hun and Sang-yun

283
00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:36.790
are staying with my brother for a while,
so don't worry.

284
00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:39.290
My brother can handle that much.

285
00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:43.420
So you... You think about only yourself.

286
00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:48.420
You can't have anything else
happen in here again.

287
00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:52.220
You're almost there.

288
00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:55.470
There's a leader above Chief Yeom.

289
00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:59.270
He was a gangster, so he's on
another level from Chief Yeom.

290
00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:02.520
I'm sure he's controlling Chief Yeom.

291
00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:15.620
Officer! Give me 100 more
chicken boxes please!

292
00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:27.960
-Gifts from Je-hyeok.
-Awesome.

293
00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:38.260
You really are a pro.

294
00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:41.980
Chief Yeom will be so disappointed
if he saw you like this.

295
00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:44.600
That's right. He got the wrong person.

296
00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:47.480
But you know, I hear that gangster jerk

297
00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:49.650
above Chief Yeom is much scarier.

298
00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:52.360
Everyone who worked for him

299
00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:54.450
who tried to screw him over
ended up in the hospital.

300
00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:58.660
And you know, I'm going to start
studying for the TOEIC.

301
00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:00.450
You know I'm smart.

302
00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.250
It's only because I didn't study. If I do,

303
00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:05.290
I bet I can get a perfect score in a year.

304
00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:08.210
I don't know if Je-hyeok will hire me,

305
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.420
but I'll work hard
and take the agent exam.

306
00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:13.920
Next year, KBO is forming an agent...

307
00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:16.550
association...

308
00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:19.140
I'll tell him next time.

309
00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.560
<i>That inmate has a real potty mouth.</i>

310
00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:24.980
<i>He's disrespectful and curses like
no other. "Bastard, asshole, shithead."</i>

311
00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:27.480
"Who cares if you're a guard?
A guard is nothing."

312
00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.980
"How dare you talk down to me,
you young prick?"

313
00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:32.480
"How old are you, kid? What's your name?
What level are you?"

314
00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:35.070
He is such a... I want to kill that...

315
00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:39.030
Where are you going? I'm talking.
You can't just leave.

316
00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:40.410
I haven't even begun.

317
00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:42.240
Don't follow me. I'm going to Je-hyeok.

318
00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:43.450
I'll go too.

319
00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:10.650
Hi, honey.

320
00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:15.240
Honorable teacher for a day?

321
00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:17.150
Gosh.

322
00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:20.070
Like the kids would like that.

323
00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:23.030
<i>Do you know how disappointed Su-bin is,</i>

324
00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:24.740
<i>that her daddy won't do it?</i>

325
00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:28.410
<i>The dads of the boy who sits next to her
and Gyeong-a from downstairs went,</i>

326
00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:30.710
<i>so she keeps asking
why her daddy won't go.</i>

327
00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:32.380
What does that boy's dad do?

328
00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:34.420
<i>He has a cosmetic surgery hospital
in Gangnam.</i>

329
00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:36.210
Wow. Gosh.

330
00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:40.640
Gyeong-a's dad is a musician, right?

331
00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:42.390
<i>He's a violinist.</i>

332
00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:45.390
Exactly. That's why I won't go.

333
00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:48.180
<i>Why not? What's wrong
with a corrections officer?</i>

334
00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:50.310
What would I say to them?

335
00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:53.440
Should I say I clean up after
thieves and murderers?

336
00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:54.730
What should I say?

337
00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:56.610
Plus, kids don't know

338
00:23:57.150 --> 00:23:59.490
what a corrections officer is,
even if I explain.

339
00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:05.660
I'm sorry, but please make up an excuse
to Su-bin for me.

340
00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:08.370
Tell her Daddy's too busy that day.

341
00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:11.170
Sorry. Bye.

342
00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:32.560
Everyone, in your cells!

343
00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:45.530
What happened?

344
00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:48.540
Where did you get hurt?

345
00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.540
I fell while I was working.

346
00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:13.940
-I'm fine.
-Spill it.

347
00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:17.230
Tell us. Now. It's okay.

348
00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:23.950
They said not to help you with baseball.

349
00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:28.580
Those crazy bastards.

350
00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:30.500
I refused,

351
00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:34.870
and Chief Yeom and their head
stepped on my hands.

352
00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:38.250
Did you just take it? Did you?

353
00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:40.840
You just took it?

354
00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:43.220
You should've socked it to them.

355
00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:50.810
Je-hyeok told me not to hit people.

356
00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:52.640
Gosh. What the...

357
00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.610
You said not to

358
00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:02.820
hit people ever again.

359
00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:04.280
Gosh.

360
00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:35.690
Boss.

361
00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:40.360
This will heal in a week.

362
00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:42.320
I'm a beast.

363
00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:44.740
If you'd wait a week,

364
00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:47.200
we can practice again in the yard.

365
00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:50.320
I'll heal right away.

366
00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.450
Check your account tomorrow.

367
00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:41.960
I hear you're just a minion too.

368
00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:48.380
If I pay 300 million won,
what do you get, 100 million?

369
00:27:52.390 --> 00:27:54.850
You have to pay your master, right?

370
00:27:57.390 --> 00:28:00.060
Tell me if you need it.
I'll give you more for your share.

371
00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:04.110
No.

372
00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:06.400
I'm going to keep it all.

373
00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:11.860
I'll rat out that bastard for assault,

374
00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:13.280
and keep all of this myself.

375
00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:17.200
I'm not the type to work under someone.

376
00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:19.250
Then take the money and get lost.

377
00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:23.460
Sure. But sorry.

378
00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:25.210
There's accrued interest.

379
00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:28.920
A little interest accrued.

380
00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:31.630
Very little.

381
00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:34.510
Pay that back

382
00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:37.520
with your body.

383
00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:45.440
CRPT's on patrol. You need to go now.

384
00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:47.480
Sure.

385
00:28:53.910 --> 00:28:55.070
Deposit the money tomorrow.

386
00:28:57.540 --> 00:28:58.580
Also,

387
00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:02.420
Come to the incinerator at midnight.

388
00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:05.920
Come alone.

389
00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:07.960
Got it?

390
00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:17.640
Come alone.

391
00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:28.770
Come out. Let's go to sleep.

392
00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:44.040
ADMINISTRATION OFFICE

393
00:29:57.510 --> 00:29:58.970
Here's your personal account summary.

394
00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:00.970
Thank you.

395
00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:05.730
It's the insurance payment
for a car accident from last year.

396
00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:07.270
This is why you get insurance.

397
00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:10.610
Come on.
I received it in the envelope too.

398
00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:13.690
We can't look at people's
personal accounts anymore.

399
00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:16.740
I see.

400
00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:18.240
Let's go.

401
00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:29.540
COMMISSARY ACCOUNT LEDGER
DEPOSIT: 300 MILLION WON

402
00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:42.220
Hey, call the errand boy.

403
00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:44.890
<i>A broadcast shared with 50,000 inmates.</i>

404
00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:47.770
<i>I am Min-joo Lee, your host
of the Borami Broadcast.</i>

405
00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:50.110
<i>There's a saying</i>

406
00:30:50.270 --> 00:30:53.110
<i>that the person who tied the knot
should untie it.</i>

407
00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:54.610
<i>It means,</i>

408
00:30:54.690 --> 00:30:58.660
<i>if you did something, you must
be accountable and fix it yourself.</i>

409
00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:01.120
<i>If there is something remaining</i>

410
00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:04.160
<i>that you must do this year, or even today,</i>

411
00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:06.870
<i>why don't you take action right away,</i>

412
00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:09.540
<i>and not delay or hesitate any longer?</i>

413
00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:12.800
<i>Everyone, you all did well today.</i>

414
00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:14.130
<i>Have a good night.</i>

415
00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:36.740
Je-hyeok Kim.

416
00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:39.610
Here.

417
00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:47.120
<i>Just in case you say something stupid,</i>

418
00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:49.040
<i>since you are so close to the guards,</i>

419
00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:51.130
<i>I thought I'd let you know something.</i>

420
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.840
<i>There's a restaurant that my boss' boys
go to frequently lately.</i>

421
00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:58.720
<i>The restaurant name is unique. "S.K.O."</i>

422
00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:01.510
<i>Just saying.</i>

423
00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:04.510
<i>See you later.</i>

424
00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:39.760
<i>You'll stay with me
even if I quit baseball, </i>

425
00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:42.130
<i>right?</i>

426
00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:42.360
INCINERATOR

427
00:33:57.330 --> 00:33:58.210
Why?

428
00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:00.170
Do you want to hit me?

429
00:34:04.050 --> 00:34:06.720
You must be pissed off
because I mentioned your sister.

430
00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:12.180
But you can't hit me.

431
00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:15.100
You're making your comeback soon.

432
00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:19.360
If you beat me up, your sentence
will be extended, and you can't get out.

433
00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:21.730
Got that?

434
00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:24.780
You can't get out of here.

435
00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:29.070
Forget returning to baseball.

436
00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:31.450
You'll be finished, you bastard.

437
00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:34.960
I don't need to get out.

438
00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:39.130
I won't play baseball.

439
00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:47.720
I decided not to play baseball
because of you,

440
00:34:49.050 --> 00:34:50.470
you piece of trash.

441
00:34:52.890 --> 00:34:54.930
Because of fuckers like you...

442
00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:06.320
I plan

443
00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:10.450
to end my life right here.

444
00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:21.920
Hey.

445
00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:25.420
Hey.

446
00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:27.880
Hey. Stop.

447
00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:29.470
Wait...

448
00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:02.460
Please stop. Stop it.

449
00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:04.090
Please, stop!

450
00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:16.810
Je-hyeok.

451
00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:22.100
This is all I can do for you.

452
00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:27.940
Thank you...

453
00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:31.860
for what you did.

454
00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:39.290
Thank you for saving my life.

455
00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:43.040
It kept bothering me...

456
00:36:44.290 --> 00:36:46.210
that I didn't thank you back then.

457
00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:50.380
I can finally say it now.

458
00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:53.760
I'm sorry for saying it...

459
00:36:56.350 --> 00:36:57.470
so late.

460
00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:32.630
ESTABLISH LAW AND ORDER

461
00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:44.480
-My gosh.
-Gosh.

462
00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:48.070
Hey. Are you awake now?

463
00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:51.650
He needs to wake up,

464
00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:54.240
so that we can throw him in the hole.

465
00:37:56.950 --> 00:38:00.330
Je-hyeok Kim hit me.

466
00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:02.040
What?

467
00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:05.580
That bastard Je-hyeok Kim hit me,
you punk.

468
00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:08.840
Oh, my. Listen to how he speaks
to the officers.

469
00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:12.590
And the old man Lifer

470
00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:15.840
gave his statement that he beat you up.

471
00:38:17.590 --> 00:38:19.970
Je-hyeok Kim was there too.

472
00:38:21.970 --> 00:38:24.690
Je-hyeok Kim hit me too.

473
00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:26.850
Where did he come from?

474
00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:29.060
He came from Daegu, right?

475
00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:31.650
Hey, Sang-jae Yeom.

476
00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:34.400
We have a lot of cameras here.

477
00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:37.990
Our warden is obsessed with CCTVs.

478
00:38:38.070 --> 00:38:39.320
It was all caught on camera.

479
00:38:39.830 --> 00:38:43.250
It caught Lifer
beating the crap out of you.

480
00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:46.250
Also, you threatened Je-hyeok Kim

481
00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:48.130
to give you 300 million won?

482
00:38:48.210 --> 00:38:50.420
-What?
-You poor thing.

483
00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:52.340
That was recorded as well.

484
00:38:53.170 --> 00:38:54.260
Recorded?

485
00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:57.340
Who recorded it?

486
00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:02.640
I did.

487
00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:05.810
I recorded it.

488
00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:12.230

491
00:39:21.370 --> 00:39:22.490
Keep listening.

492
00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:24.200
<i>I'm going to keep it all.</i>

493
00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:27.120
<i>I'll rat out that bastard for assault,</i>

494
00:39:27.210 --> 00:39:28.540
<i>and keep all of this myself.</i>

495
00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:31.750
-You bastard.
<i>-I'm not</i>

496
00:39:32.090 --> 00:39:34.090
<i>the type to work under someone.</i>

497
00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:36.220
<i>Then take the money and get lost.</i>

498
00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:43.430
Lieutenant Paeng, I have a favor to ask.

499
00:39:44.770 --> 00:39:48.060
Please play this recording
to this bastard's master,

500
00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:50.100
boss, or whatever you call it.

501
00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:54.820
The cell phone is mine,
so after you play it for him,

502
00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:57.610
you can put it in
the inmates' personal effects room.

503
00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:04.200
I swear, these punks think
I'm their servant.

504
00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:05.490
Thank you.

505
00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:07.330
Sure.

506
00:40:12.250 --> 00:40:13.670
Take care of yourself, okay?

507
00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:17.130
Asshole.

508
00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:36.820
You want your cell phone?

509
00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:39.700
Yeah, mine.

510
00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:41.610
I'll use it briefly.

511
00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:44.370
For what?

512
00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:46.330
To record something.

513
00:40:48.250 --> 00:40:49.790
Don't ask anything,

514
00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:52.120
and don't do anything please.

515
00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:53.710
I'll take care of it.

516
00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:57.880
-I'll do it.
-No. I'll do it.

517
00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:01.800
-Je-hyeok.
-If you get involved too, I...

518
00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:04.850
I may really kill that bastard.

519
00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:08.520
Let me take care of this.

520
00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:28.120
Here.

521
00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:33.120
Thanks.

522
00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:38.960
I hear the gangster punk behind Chief Yeom

523
00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:41.340
is much more evil.

524
00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:46.390
Should I work on him a little?

525
00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:49.890
No, don't do anything.

526
00:41:52.850 --> 00:41:53.980
I'll do it myself.

527
00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:56.360
Hey.

528
00:41:56.610 --> 00:41:57.610
Joon-ho.

529
00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:00.070
I'll do it.

530
00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:04.240
There's something you can help me with.

531
00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:07.410
You know someone in admin, right?

532
00:42:11.450 --> 00:42:12.620
Check your account tomorrow.

533
00:42:17.250 --> 00:42:20.420
I hear you're just a minion too.

534
00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:25.470
If I pay 300 million won,
what do you get, 100 million?

535
00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:34.180
You have to pay your master, right?

536
00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:38.270
COMMISSARY ACCOUNT LEDGER

537
00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:40.190
SANG-JAE YEOM,
BALANCE: 103,000 won

538
00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:42.940
Thank you.

539
00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:52.160
Give him this one.

540
00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:53.370
Okay.

541
00:42:55.290 --> 00:42:57.750
Sang-jae is a real psycho.

542
00:42:57.830 --> 00:43:00.420
How could he ask Je-hyeok Kim
for 300 million won?

543
00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:02.630
We won't pay him.

544
00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:05.380
This is fake, right?

545
00:43:05.970 --> 00:43:06.970
I typed it up on Word.

546
00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:10.470
Play dumb, okay?

547
00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:12.260
That's a piece of cake.

548
00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:14.100
See you later.

549
00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:23.280
That lazy punk.

550
00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:25.990
He's so quick with things like this.

551
00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:30.740
Wow. I thought Je-hyeok Kim
was the unluckiest man alive,

552
00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:32.410
but I guess I was wrong.

553
00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:35.200
I know. Thank goodness

554
00:43:35.290 --> 00:43:37.500
Lifer was working overnight last night,

555
00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:40.880
or the baseball player Je-hyeok Kim
would've been done for.

556
00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:43.880
Gosh. My heart is still racing
at the thought.

557
00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:48.800
Even if Lifer gets a year extension,
he's still in here for life.

558
00:43:48.930 --> 00:43:51.640
Even with a ten-year extension,
he's here for life.

559
00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:54.770
Wow. What better luck is there?

560
00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:59.350
I hope Je-hyeok Kim's luck
just keeps on shooting up.

561
00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:02.730
He has two... less than two months left.

562
00:44:02.810 --> 00:44:05.440
He's almost there! Almost there!

563
00:44:05.530 --> 00:44:09.240
Je-hyeok Kim, let's head to the mound!

564
00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:10.740
Let's go!

565
00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:13.620
-Why you...
-Shit.

566
00:44:14.370 --> 00:44:17.620
CHRISTMAS D-3

567
00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:19.460
MIN-CHUL KIM'S RELEASE D-1

568
00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:22.540
It's so cold. It's the warmest in here.

569
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:26.090
Why is he sleeping here?
Did he come in early?

570
00:44:26.170 --> 00:44:28.170
He came in super early.

571
00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:30.970
Jailbird was released this morning.

572
00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:34.350
He came really early to see Jailbird off.

573
00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:46.570
Are you that happy to get out?

574
00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:50.400
Poor thing. You can't even see
your hero Je-hyeok before you go.

575
00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:51.820
I saw him yesterday.

576
00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:53.740
How?

577
00:44:54.490 --> 00:44:55.910
He came to the hole.

578
00:44:56.830 --> 00:45:00.750
Does he think the prison
is his stomping ground?

579
00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:25.560
-You get out tomorrow, right?
-Yes.

580
00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:29.860
You're smart, so you can always
fall into bad things.

581
00:45:31.070 --> 00:45:32.610
You only do petty crimes now,

582
00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:35.160
but there's a high risk
of it becoming more serious.

583
00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:37.870
How could you say that to someone
who's getting out tomorrow?

584
00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:41.290
What will you do outside?

585
00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:46.040
I don't know. No one will hire me
since I'm an ex-con.

586
00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:48.460
I'll work some part-time jobs
here and there.

587
00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:51.720
Should I call this number?

588
00:45:52.090 --> 00:45:54.630
Who is it? Who is this person?

589
00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:57.680
Me.

590
00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:00.640
It's my cell phone number.

591
00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:07.730
Don't do anything stupid out there.

592
00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:11.230
Study for the TOEIC until I get out.

593
00:46:13.530 --> 00:46:15.570
I'll hire you.

594
00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:23.040
-Bro...
-It's okay.

595
00:46:23.870 --> 00:46:25.080
Don't do that.

596
00:46:49.690 --> 00:46:51.190
Lieutenant Paeng.

597
00:46:53.530 --> 00:46:55.070
Min-chul gets out tomorrow, right?

598
00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:58.870
Je-hyeok Kim gets out
in about ten days too.

599
00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:01.950
Then it'll just be Crony in that cell.

600
00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:05.660
The cell's all split up.

601
00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:07.750
Captain Yoo is there. Jung-woo Yoo.

602
00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:10.920
That's right. The petition for retrial.

603
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.670
That's taking so long.

604
00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:14.840
It looks like it won't happen this year.

605
00:47:15.090 --> 00:47:16.630
What if everyone else leaves,

606
00:47:17.010 --> 00:47:20.220
and our dear Captain Yoo
is left all alone?

607
00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:24.060
What else? You can go in there with him.

608
00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:34.860
Shit. Get away.

609
00:48:12.690 --> 00:48:15.030
You'll rub your teeth away.

610
00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:16.820
How many times was that?

611
00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:18.070
It was 25 times, boss.

612
00:48:19.570 --> 00:48:22.780
Time is crawling so slowly.
It's driving me mad.

613
00:48:24.030 --> 00:48:25.240
Should I just break out?

614
00:48:25.830 --> 00:48:27.620
Then just pack your things.

615
00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:29.540
I did.

616
00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:32.040
I finished packing ten days ago.

617
00:48:32.130 --> 00:48:33.130
4502 Min-chul Kang

618
00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:37.630
You should start packing too.

619
00:48:39.010 --> 00:48:40.300
I've packed already.

620
00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:41.550
Oh.

621
00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:53.940
Don't worry about me.

622
00:48:54.110 --> 00:48:57.230
I'm fine. I'll get out soon too.

623
00:48:57.320 --> 00:48:59.860
That's right. You'll get out soon too.

624
00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:02.320
That asshole Sergeant Oh will go to jail,

625
00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:04.740
and you'll get out soon.

626
00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:06.370
Hang in there.

627
00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:15.590
I guess these punks really won't decide
within the year.

628
00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:18.920
How do we find out

629
00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:21.170
the result, anyway?

630
00:49:21.930 --> 00:49:23.680
Do you have to go to the court?

631
00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:25.890
No. They mail the decision.

632
00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:30.230
One to my office,

633
00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:33.560
and one to Jung-woo,
since he's the petitioner.

634
00:49:37.690 --> 00:49:39.230
Don't you have any other clothes?

635
00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:43.570
Are you going to wear that all winter?

636
00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:44.700
What's wrong with it?

637
00:49:45.410 --> 00:49:46.990
It's nice and warm.

638
00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:06.680
Min-chul.

639
00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:09.180
Let's go home.

640
00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:13.940
SE-YUN PAENG

641
00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:40.000
Once I get out,

642
00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:42.420
I'll call you right away.

643
00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:48.090
Okay. The day you return
to the baseball stadium,

644
00:50:49.050 --> 00:50:50.810
I'll hold a block party.

645
00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:55.940
I'll say, "He's the best player
in the entire world."

646
00:50:57.100 --> 00:51:00.480
"That player deserves much more applause

647
00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:04.030
and many more blessings."

648
00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:07.910
I'll invite everyone in the town

649
00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:11.080
and bless you and cheer you on.

650
00:51:12.370 --> 00:51:15.370
I'll take out a loan if necessary,

651
00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:17.790
but I'll throw a huge party, sir.

652
00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:21.290
Why are you suddenly calling me "sir"?

653
00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:25.010
I'm a nobody,
but I was so lucky to meet you,

654
00:51:25.550 --> 00:51:27.550
and spend all this time with you

655
00:51:28.430 --> 00:51:30.300
like brothers.

656
00:51:30.890 --> 00:51:31.930
Thanks.

657
00:51:32.850 --> 00:51:34.640
I'm just thankful, that's why.

658
00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:38.020
Thanks

659
00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:41.440
for treating me like a big brother.

660
00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:44.150
Thank you for everything.

661
00:51:58.790 --> 00:51:59.870
Jung-woo.

662
00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:04.920
Don't let go.

663
00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:08.300
Don't let go of hope.

664
00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:12.260
You'll get your retrial for sure.

665
00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:16.060
For the past few months,

666
00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:18.560
I begged God.

667
00:52:19.310 --> 00:52:22.980
I said I don't want anything else anymore,

668
00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:26.860
and that instead of blessing me,

669
00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:30.530
I asked Him to clear your name.

670
00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:34.910
To please let your petition for retrial

671
00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:36.950
be granted.

672
00:52:37.450 --> 00:52:40.210
I begged God every single day.

673
00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:44.000
You're almost there.

674
00:52:44.590 --> 00:52:46.000
You're almost there, Jung-woo.

675
00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:49.170
Hang in there.

676
00:53:22.540 --> 00:53:25.210
Be careful when you get out.
It's scary out there.

677
00:53:27.590 --> 00:53:29.300
It's funny to me too, now that I said it.

678
00:53:31.090 --> 00:53:33.050
-Lieutenant Paeng.
-Yeah?

679
00:53:39.140 --> 00:53:40.930
Why are you hugging a man? It's gross.

680
00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:46.520
Because I like you.

681
00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:50.900
I like you more than anyone
in the entire world.

682
00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:53.650
I like my daughter.

683
00:53:55.530 --> 00:53:58.240
Me too. To be honest,

684
00:53:58.990 --> 00:54:00.410
I like my daughter the most.

685
00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:03.210
You have a daughter? You had a daughter?

686
00:54:04.830 --> 00:54:06.250
Why didn't you tell me?

687
00:54:07.290 --> 00:54:10.510
I'll tell you everything next time
when I come to visit.

688
00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:14.510
Sure. Come hang out,
instead of a visitation.

689
00:54:14.930 --> 00:54:16.890
Let's hang out and have a drink.

690
00:54:18.930 --> 00:54:20.890
Jean Valjean is waiting outside.

691
00:54:20.970 --> 00:54:23.680
That college girl came too.

692
00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:26.520
Is she not done with her thesis yet?

693
00:54:27.110 --> 00:54:28.060
No.

694
00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:31.360
She says it'll take her another 50 years.

695
00:54:31.940 --> 00:54:33.690
What? Is she stupid?

696
00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:40.580
Thank you for everything.

697
00:54:42.450 --> 00:54:44.040
I'll live a good life.

698
00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:50.590
Live a good life. I'll be cheering you on.

699
00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:15.990
No! Why should I go?

700
00:55:17.450 --> 00:55:19.320
You're a good talker.

701
00:55:19.410 --> 00:55:22.490
Please sweet-talk that inmate. Please?

702
00:55:22.580 --> 00:55:25.200
I knew his temper
would get him in trouble someday.

703
00:55:25.290 --> 00:55:27.210
That jerk said something bad first.

704
00:55:27.290 --> 00:55:29.960
Even if he did!
How could he hit an inmate?

705
00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:31.590
Is he a thug or what?

706
00:55:32.090 --> 00:55:34.210
He can just ignore it.

707
00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:36.340
Please. Hurry.

708
00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:39.090
He's in the infirmary, saying he'll report
Lieutenant Paeng

709
00:55:39.180 --> 00:55:42.390
for human rights violations. With his
temper, Lieutenant Paeng won't apologize.

710
00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:46.060
He will be disciplined
if he gets another demerit.

711
00:55:46.730 --> 00:55:48.980
Please go and talk him out of it, please!

712
00:55:49.060 --> 00:55:50.520
I don't want to!

713
00:55:57.150 --> 00:55:57.990
Shit!

714
00:55:58.070 --> 00:56:01.910
All you have to do is say, "Sorry,"
that's all.

715
00:56:01.990 --> 00:56:03.240
I don't want to!

716
00:56:03.490 --> 00:56:06.160
I'm pissed that I didn't hit him more.
I won't apologize.

717
00:56:06.750 --> 00:56:08.960
What? You'll hit him more
and just get fired?

718
00:56:10.460 --> 00:56:12.540
Why did you beat a person up?

719
00:56:13.420 --> 00:56:14.630
Go and apologize.

720
00:56:15.210 --> 00:56:16.960
No. You stay out of it.

721
00:56:17.050 --> 00:56:19.090
Who cares about pride right now?

722
00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:23.220
Apologize for now and later take care
of it according to the rules.

723
00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:25.810
Aren't you used to inmates
swearing at you?

724
00:56:27.230 --> 00:56:28.680
Please, just ignore the garbage

725
00:56:28.770 --> 00:56:31.980
that inmates say,
and just let it go! Please!

726
00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:34.770
You know what that bastard said?

727
00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:40.610
He said once he gets out,
he'll abduct my wife and daughter, and...

728
00:56:46.540 --> 00:56:48.120
-You bastard.
-Hey, Lieutenant Lee!

729
00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:52.880
You asshole. How dare you
run your mouth like that?

730
00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:54.500
You shithead.

731
00:56:54.670 --> 00:56:57.420
How dare you say something like that?
You asshole!

732
00:56:58.590 --> 00:57:01.300
We were too nice to you,
you fucking asshole.

733
00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:03.220
-Hey.
-Lieutenant Lee, what's wrong with you?

734
00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:05.600
-Keep yapping! You asshole!
-Stop!

735
00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:07.970
-Lieutenant. Come on.
-Keep yapping!

736
00:57:08.060 --> 00:57:09.140
Lieutenant Lee!

737
00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:10.600
COFFEE WITH CREAM
300 WON

738
00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:21.070
Gosh.

739
00:57:48.140 --> 00:57:49.640
What's wrong? What are you doing?

740
00:57:49.730 --> 00:57:52.730
Wash your ears.
Wash out the foul things you heard.

741
00:57:52.850 --> 00:57:54.020
Seriously.

742
00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:58.650
I didn't let him finish, anyway.
I beat him up right away.

743
00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:05.200
All done.

744
00:58:08.700 --> 00:58:09.910
I'm going home now.

745
00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:12.790
Hey, Lieutenant Lee. Wait a second.

746
00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:25.760
Have a nice day.

747
00:58:26.350 --> 00:58:27.220
I have another one.

748
00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:40.530
I almost have it.

749
00:58:41.610 --> 00:58:44.410
SEOBU PENITENTIARY
JE-HYEOK KIM'S RELEASE D-7

750
00:58:50.660 --> 00:58:51.790
Do you read the papers?

751
00:58:53.790 --> 00:58:55.170
Today's fortune.

752
00:58:56.960 --> 00:58:59.170
What's your zodiac? The dragon?

753
00:58:59.750 --> 00:59:00.840
Yes, the dragon.

754
00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:03.550
Where is the dragon?

755
00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:05.510
Here it is.

756
00:59:17.480 --> 00:59:20.270
WING 2B HELPER

757
00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:22.940
Did something come for Jung-woo Yoo?

758
00:59:26.700 --> 00:59:27.950
Here it is.

759
00:59:28.620 --> 00:59:30.200
Seoul Western District Court.

760
00:59:32.410 --> 00:59:33.950
SEOUL WESTERN DISTRICT COURT

761
00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:35.410
What is it?

762
00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:37.830
It's bad, isn't it?

763
00:59:38.420 --> 00:59:40.090
Tell me. I don't believe it anyway.

764
00:59:41.090 --> 00:59:42.800
Sure. This is all a scam.

765
00:59:43.090 --> 00:59:45.760
It says I shouldn't take trips
or go shopping today.

766
00:59:47.050 --> 00:59:48.470
So, what does it say?

767
00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:56.520
"Hardships were added
to an already strenuous life.

768
00:59:56.980 --> 01:00:00.730
Even if what you hoped for fails,
do not be too discouraged."

769
01:00:23.170 --> 01:00:24.550
Do you want to look?

770
01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:42.770
I'll look. Give it to me.

771
01:00:49.490 --> 01:00:52.660
It'll say, "Decision," on top.
It will be the same there.

772
01:00:53.830 --> 01:00:56.160
If the retrial was granted, it'll say,

773
01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:58.460
"The petition has been granted."

774
01:00:58.540 --> 01:00:59.460
If we didn't get it,

775
01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:01.960
the front part looks the same,

776
01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:03.750
but it'll say "denied,"

777
01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.760
instead of "granted."

778
01:01:15.180 --> 01:01:16.600
DECISION

779
01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:20.850
PETITIONER: JUNG-WOO YOO

780
01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:26.940
Petitioner's Petition
for Retrial has been...

781
01:02:02.190 --> 01:02:03.810
Why? What?

782
01:02:30.510 --> 01:02:34.260
Petitioner's Petition for Retrial
has been granted.

783
01:02:41.140 --> 01:02:42.230
Why? What?

784
01:02:44.850 --> 01:02:46.270
"Petitioner's...

785
01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:50.900
Petition for Retrial...

786
01:02:52.570 --> 01:02:53.740
has been granted."

787
01:03:04.250 --> 01:03:05.790
I told you. See?

788
01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.750
-Don't cry. Stop.
-Yes!

789
01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:10.000
Congratulations!

790
01:03:10.750 --> 01:03:12.630
-Good job.
-Thanks, buddy.

791
01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:14.800
Thank you so, so much, Min-gu.

792
01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:16.300
You did more.

793
01:03:19.390 --> 01:03:20.600
PRIVATE JUN-YEONG PARK'S MOTHER

794
01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:21.890
This is just the beginning.

795
01:03:23.730 --> 01:03:26.600
I'm sorry for suddenly showing up
like this.

796
01:03:27.770 --> 01:03:29.940
It's okay. How have you been?

797
01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:32.860
I'm... well. I'm okay.

798
01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:34.950
Well...

799
01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:41.240
This is the payout...

800
01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:44.290
for Jun-yeong's wrongful death.

801
01:03:45.790 --> 01:03:47.670
I couldn't get myself to spend any of it.

802
01:03:49.590 --> 01:03:51.250
I think it was meant to be used for this.

803
01:03:53.670 --> 01:03:55.170
ETERNITY BANKBOOK

804
01:03:57.340 --> 01:03:59.140
Please use it for the retrial.

805
01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:01.760
I heard the retrial

806
01:04:02.350 --> 01:04:05.230
can take up to two years.

807
01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:09.610
I'm sure it'll be costly.

808
01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:13.190
I want to be of help.

809
01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:19.280
No, ma'am. I...

810
01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:22.580
have people helping.

811
01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:24.330
After a while,

812
01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:27.920
it becomes uncomfortable
receiving help from others.

813
01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:29.960
You know that.

814
01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:36.670
Please use this. I'm sure Jun-yeong...

815
01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:40.800
will like that.

816
01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:48.140
Also,

817
01:04:49.140 --> 01:04:50.520
this...

818
01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:54.270
This is my gift to you.

819
01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:58.820
Please buy yourself a thick jacket.

820
01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:01.950
It's very cold.

821
01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:05.910
It'll be a long battle.

822
01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:10.000
You need to dress warmly.

823
01:05:11.710 --> 01:05:15.090
The next time I see you,
I'm going to check

824
01:05:15.590 --> 01:05:18.470
whether or not you bought a jacket.

825
01:05:19.050 --> 01:05:21.180
I'll check the price too,

826
01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:23.850
so please,

827
01:05:24.970 --> 01:05:28.230
use all of this.
Don't leave a single dollar.

828
01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:31.810
Buy a nice, expensive jacket.

829
01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:33.940
That will make me...

830
01:05:35.270 --> 01:05:36.940
feel a little better.

831
01:05:44.660 --> 01:05:46.030
Thank you.

832
01:05:50.410 --> 01:05:52.960
SEOBU PENITENTIARY
JE-HYEOK KIM'S RELEASE D-1

833
01:05:54.170 --> 01:05:57.300
Thanks. My little brother is the best.

834
01:05:59.470 --> 01:06:03.720
Seriously, Warden.
You're milking it so thoroughly.

835
01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:06.350
To be honest, Je-hyeok Kim

836
01:06:06.890 --> 01:06:08.930
can give an interview before his release.

837
01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:11.730
He received so much here.

838
01:06:11.810 --> 01:06:14.310
Still, he's being released tomorrow.
Why do we want

839
01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:16.110
people to see him in his jumpsuit?

840
01:06:16.190 --> 01:06:17.940
The fan should stay out of this.

841
01:06:20.030 --> 01:06:22.450
It's okay. I'll do it.

842
01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:24.360
I have things to say, too.

843
01:06:24.570 --> 01:06:27.530
My little brother is such a big person.

844
01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:31.160
Also, there's a guest waiting outside.

845
01:06:31.290 --> 01:06:35.130
He says he's your fan
and wanted to meet you just once.

846
01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:37.920
Who is it?

847
01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:41.420
The Minister of Justice is here.

848
01:06:42.090 --> 01:06:44.970
Oh, my goodness gracious.

849
01:06:50.220 --> 01:06:52.730
WARDEN'S OFFICE

850
01:06:52.810 --> 01:06:54.020
Whose idea was it?

851
01:06:58.440 --> 01:06:59.690
Captain Na.

852
01:07:00.530 --> 01:07:03.900
Captain Na said we should film

853
01:07:03.990 --> 01:07:06.990
a whole bunch of promotional videos
before Je-hyeok Kim leaves.

854
01:07:07.070 --> 01:07:08.280
What?

855
01:07:08.370 --> 01:07:12.330
The Minister just piggybacked onto it.

856
01:07:14.210 --> 01:07:15.330
Sir.

857
01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:19.630
-Yes?
-Our apologies. We don't mean anything.

858
01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:21.920
It's okay.

859
01:07:24.170 --> 01:07:27.760
He went to grade school, junior high,
and high school with Captain Na.

860
01:07:27.890 --> 01:07:29.350
They're best friends.

861
01:07:30.850 --> 01:07:33.480
He and Captain Na

862
01:07:34.020 --> 01:07:36.060
planned this all together.

863
01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:39.270
-Right?
-Yes, that's right.

864
01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:42.990
Hyeong-su came up with the idea,
and we piggybacked on.

865
01:07:43.070 --> 01:07:47.240
But even Captain Na has a best friend?

866
01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:50.330
Are you really his best friend?

867
01:07:50.410 --> 01:07:52.580
Yes. I'm the only one.

868
01:08:01.340 --> 01:08:03.420
Before the interview with the reporters,

869
01:08:03.590 --> 01:08:06.550
let's film a few simple videos,
my little brother.

870
01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:08.430
That's okay, right?

871
01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:14.680
Please say it's okay, Je-hyeok.

872
01:08:16.310 --> 01:08:17.390
Yes, big brother.

873
01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:19.520
I understand.

874
01:08:29.950 --> 01:08:33.490
First, we'll do a word of encouragement
for new corrections workers.

875
01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:35.290
Cue.

876
01:08:35.450 --> 01:08:39.120
For the advancement of reform in Korea!

877
01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:42.380
Here's to Korea's Correctional Service!

878
01:08:45.210 --> 01:08:49.680
Next, we'll film a greeting
for new inmates.

879
01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:51.350
Cue.

880
01:08:51.510 --> 01:08:55.220
They reached out
when the world turned its back on me.

881
01:08:55.930 --> 01:08:59.020
The Correctional Service
will find you hope!

882
01:08:59.230 --> 01:09:01.360
Okay. Good. Very good.

883
01:09:02.230 --> 01:09:05.320
Lastly, we'll do a comment
by Je-hyeok Kim alone.

884
01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:09.910
Something to celebrate
Reform Day this October,

885
01:09:09.990 --> 01:09:10.990
please.

886
01:09:12.530 --> 01:09:13.450
When?

887
01:09:13.530 --> 01:09:15.410
October 28th of this year.

888
01:09:25.630 --> 01:09:28.420
Happy Reform Day, 2018.

889
01:09:29.130 --> 01:09:32.300
Please continue to work hard
for a just Korea.

890
01:09:33.010 --> 01:09:35.930
All 15,000 of you who work in corrections,
thank you!

891
01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:39.310
A heart sign.

892
01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:42.150
Je-hyeok Kim? A heart, please.

893
01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:48.070
Okay, thank you.

894
01:09:51.530 --> 01:09:52.660
You did great.

895
01:09:54.570 --> 01:09:56.450
The Minister must be very busy.

896
01:09:56.950 --> 01:09:59.160
He left as soon as he finished
recording his part.

897
01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:01.370
Yes, he has appointments back to back.

898
01:10:01.870 --> 01:10:04.210
You should go with him. You're his aide.

899
01:10:04.290 --> 01:10:05.920
He has plenty of aides.

900
01:10:06.290 --> 01:10:08.170
You don't need to worry.

901
01:10:09.050 --> 01:10:10.510
It's to do with the taxpayers' money,

902
01:10:12.510 --> 01:10:13.590
so it does worry me.

903
01:10:16.890 --> 01:10:17.890
Seriously.

904
01:10:19.390 --> 01:10:20.980
I want to take out Captain Na.

905
01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:22.890
How could a human being be so despicable?

906
01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:24.980
He's such a turnoff.

907
01:10:27.820 --> 01:10:29.070
I'm sorry.

908
01:10:29.820 --> 01:10:32.400
Don't be. You're totally right.

909
01:10:33.450 --> 01:10:35.160
He's a total prick.

910
01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:38.240
Excuse me.

911
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:41.790
May I ask you something?

912
01:10:43.830 --> 01:10:46.130
Does Captain Na have a past?

913
01:10:48.130 --> 01:10:53.590
Did something happen in his past
that we don't know about,

914
01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:55.840
that made him that way?

915
01:11:07.810 --> 01:11:08.980
Captain Na...

916
01:11:10.190 --> 01:11:11.190
I mean, Hyeong-su...

917
01:11:13.150 --> 01:11:14.240
In grade school...

918
01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:18.450
He was exactly the same.

919
01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:25.370
That punk was always like that.
Nothing happened.

920
01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:29.130
He was just born like that.

921
01:11:31.380 --> 01:11:32.840
Compared to how he used to be,

922
01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:36.970
he's a total saint now.

923
01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:48.610
1987 BOMUN GRADE SCHOOL

924
01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:51.650
Okay, that will be all for today.

925
01:11:54.610 --> 01:11:57.200
I think we were supposed to do
something today.

926
01:12:01.910 --> 01:12:02.950
What was it?

927
01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:05.330
During nature class yesterday,

928
01:12:05.410 --> 01:12:08.130
you gave us an assignment
to write about the kidney bean,

929
01:12:08.210 --> 01:12:09.580
but you haven't reviewed it yet.

930
01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:13.210
Really?

931
01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:16.800
You punks. Submit your homework!

932
01:12:18.430 --> 01:12:20.720
You said you'd give us
a spelling test as well.

933
01:12:26.310 --> 01:12:27.690
Okay, get ready.

934
01:12:30.810 --> 01:12:31.770
One.

935
01:12:35.190 --> 01:12:36.610
-Two.
-One.

936
01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:37.820
Two.

937
01:12:37.900 --> 01:12:40.660
Your elbow must touch your knee
for it to count.

938
01:12:47.460 --> 01:12:48.960
One.

939
01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:54.050
-Two.
-One.

940
01:12:54.130 --> 01:12:55.300
Why this time?

941
01:12:55.380 --> 01:12:57.470
You used your butt. That's still one.

942
01:12:57.550 --> 01:12:58.880
-Then you do it!
-Shoot.

943
01:12:59.180 --> 01:13:00.840
What? You want to fight?

944
01:13:00.930 --> 01:13:03.010
-Shoot! Let go!
-Stop fighting!

945
01:13:03.970 --> 01:13:05.640
Stop them!

946
01:13:06.140 --> 01:13:08.980
-Come here.
-Guys! Guys!

947
01:13:11.770 --> 01:13:14.400
Je-hyeok Kim. Congratulations.

948
01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:16.480
Thank you.

949
01:13:16.570 --> 01:13:17.940
I'm a fan.

950
01:13:18.990 --> 01:13:23.070
May I ask you for a favor,
if you don't mind?

951
01:13:24.950 --> 01:13:27.620
I hear you're giving an interview later.

952
01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:30.710
He made a difficult decision for me,

953
01:13:30.790 --> 01:13:33.590
since we're so close.

954
01:13:34.250 --> 01:13:36.500
With three TV and newspaper reporters,

955
01:13:36.590 --> 01:13:38.380
we booked ten interviews.

956
01:13:41.260 --> 01:13:42.390
Little brother.

957
01:13:45.850 --> 01:13:48.100
During your interview,

958
01:13:48.180 --> 01:13:51.350
would you please mention
the Minister's name just once?

959
01:13:53.690 --> 01:13:56.150
It's Minister Jong-ha Kim.

960
01:14:00.070 --> 01:14:01.910
Jong-hwa Kim?

961
01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:04.570
No, Jong-ha Kim.

962
01:14:04.820 --> 01:14:07.240
"Ha" as in ha ha ha. "Ha."

963
01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:10.790
I'd be grateful if you'd mention his name

964
01:14:11.410 --> 01:14:14.290
as one of the people who helped you.

965
01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:16.130
Okay.

966
01:14:21.510 --> 01:14:23.970
Finally, if there's anyone
you'd like to thank...

967
01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:28.270
There are many.

968
01:14:30.390 --> 01:14:31.480
Among them,

969
01:14:32.850 --> 01:14:34.770
one person comes to mind.

970
01:14:39.190 --> 01:14:40.490
Our corrections officers.

971
01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:47.830
I'd like to use this opportunity to thank
our corrections officers

972
01:14:48.330 --> 01:14:51.080
for their hard work

973
01:14:52.250 --> 01:14:54.120
over the past year.

974
01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:00.510
Warden Yong-chul Kim. Thank you.

975
01:15:02.010 --> 01:15:05.550
Officer Seong-jae Park,
Officer Ji-sang Ok,

976
01:15:06.890 --> 01:15:08.310
Officer Ki-doong Song,

977
01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:11.140
thank you so much.

978
01:15:11.730 --> 01:15:14.100
CRPT's Captain Do-yun Kim,

979
01:15:14.190 --> 01:15:16.520
Chief medical officer Yoon-hwan Jang,

980
01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:20.030
Officer Wu-gyeong Sim from the woodshop,

981
01:15:20.690 --> 01:15:22.280
thank you very much.

982
01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:27.910
Captain Hyeong-su Na, too.
Thank you very much.

983
01:15:29.410 --> 01:15:30.830
And...

984
01:15:32.330 --> 01:15:33.830
the person I'm most thankful to.

985
01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:41.130
The person who helped me the most
to adjust to this place.

986
01:15:43.470 --> 01:15:44.800
Officer Se-yun Paeng.

987
01:15:48.510 --> 01:15:49.550
Lieutenant Paeng.

988
01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:51.640
Lieutenant Paeng.

989
01:15:54.270 --> 01:15:55.770
Thank you very much.

990
01:15:57.480 --> 01:15:59.400
It's all thanks to you, Lieutenant Paeng.

991
01:16:07.490 --> 01:16:09.740
Thanks to the help of all the people
at Seobu Penitentiary,

992
01:16:12.410 --> 01:16:14.870
I can go home tomorrow safe and healthy.

993
01:16:18.540 --> 01:16:19.830
Everyone,

994
01:16:20.710 --> 01:16:24.010
I will see you again on the mound.

995
01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:35.640
Warden Yong-chul Kim.

996
01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:38.440
Officer Seong-jae Park.

997
01:16:38.810 --> 01:16:40.520
Officer Ji-sang Ok.

998
01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:43.020
Officer Ki-doong Song.

999
01:16:44.980 --> 01:16:46.740
Chief medical officer Yoon-hwan Jang.

1000
01:16:47.780 --> 01:16:49.910
I didn't forget anyone, did I?

1001
01:16:50.700 --> 01:16:51.660
Me.

1002
01:16:51.660 --> 01:16:53.790
I didn't forget anyone, did I?

1003
01:16:54.580 --> 01:16:55.790
Me.

1004
01:16:57.670 --> 01:16:58.920
You forgot me.

1005
01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:04.210
Hey, hey, Joon-ho. I must've lost my mind.

1006
01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:07.010
How could I forget you? I'm so sorry.

1007
01:17:08.970 --> 01:17:11.510
-Are you even really sorry?
-Yeah, I'm really sorry.

1008
01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:13.890
I really must've lost my mind.
I'm really sorry.

1009
01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:16.060
Hey, then...

1010
01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:19.560
you'll forgive me for anything
I'm going to say to you?

1011
01:17:24.070 --> 01:17:25.570
I'm going out with Je-hee.

1012
01:17:28.950 --> 01:17:30.530
We've been together for five months.

1013
01:17:38.710 --> 01:17:39.540
What?

1014
01:17:39.870 --> 01:17:41.960
Don't do it. Hey. Je-hyeok.

1015
01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:44.500
-Don't do it.
-Get over here. Get over here.

1016
01:17:44.590 --> 01:17:46.840
-You said you were sorry.
-Get over here.

1017
01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:49.180
Put it down. Put that down.
You'll get in trouble.

1018
01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:50.760
Why you...

1019
01:17:55.140 --> 01:17:56.310
Why you...

1020
01:18:02.860 --> 01:18:03.980
You can't sleep, can you?

1021
01:18:04.940 --> 01:18:05.860
No.

1022
01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:09.990
You have seven...
No, not even six hours left.

1023
01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:12.570
Yeah.

1024
01:18:13.700 --> 01:18:15.490
The reporters must be camped outside.

1025
01:18:15.580 --> 01:18:16.580
At this hour?

1026
01:18:16.790 --> 01:18:18.620
Of course. It's him.

1027
01:18:19.370 --> 01:18:22.290
Superhero Je-hyeok Kim is being released.
Everyone has to come.

1028
01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:28.710
-Will your girlfriend come too?
-Of course.

1029
01:18:29.670 --> 01:18:32.130
She will. She said she will.

1030
01:18:32.220 --> 01:18:34.140
Oh, no.

1031
01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:38.430
I'm sure you'll want to hold her hand
and kiss her and stuff,

1032
01:18:39.270 --> 01:18:42.440
but the reporters will all be there.
You poor thing.

1033
01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:44.980
I'll take care of it.

1034
01:18:45.820 --> 01:18:47.110
You worry about yourself.

1035
01:18:47.690 --> 01:18:50.030
Will your sister be there?

1036
01:18:51.990 --> 01:18:55.950
You should tell her not to come. What if
the reporters take her picture and stuff?

1037
01:18:56.330 --> 01:18:58.330
I'm not that stupid.

1038
01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:00.750
I said I'll see her at home.

1039
01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:02.790
Plus,

1040
01:19:03.790 --> 01:19:07.130
my sister came to see me yesterday.

1041
01:19:09.510 --> 01:19:12.430
Really? That's the first time, right?

1042
01:19:13.970 --> 01:19:15.010
Yeah.

1043
01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:25.900
Leave, if you're going to do that.

1044
01:19:30.030 --> 01:19:31.150
Je-hyeok.

1045
01:19:32.900 --> 01:19:33.820
I'm sorry.

1046
01:19:34.660 --> 01:19:36.870
Hey, hey. Stop it.

1047
01:19:37.740 --> 01:19:41.160
If you keep crying, I'm going to get mad.

1048
01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:45.670
I swore I wouldn't cry,

1049
01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:47.590
but I can't help it when I look at you.

1050
01:19:52.170 --> 01:19:53.090
I'm sorry.

1051
01:19:54.340 --> 01:19:55.590
I'm so sorry.

1052
01:19:59.220 --> 01:20:00.060
And...

1053
01:20:07.060 --> 01:20:08.190
thank you.

1054
01:20:17.990 --> 01:20:19.990
One good thing came out of going to jail.

1055
01:20:20.530 --> 01:20:23.580
My aloof little sister
actually thanked me.

1056
01:20:26.710 --> 01:20:29.080
Be like that to me on a normal basis.

1057
01:20:30.130 --> 01:20:32.210
Don't be cutesy only to your boyfriend.

1058
01:20:32.300 --> 01:20:35.050
Be sweet to your brother too, please.

1059
01:20:38.260 --> 01:20:39.680
That's it.

1060
01:20:40.260 --> 01:20:42.390
Glare at me.
That's the Je-hee that I know.

1061
01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:50.270
-Je-hyeok.
-Yeah?

1062
01:20:50.980 --> 01:20:52.270
Well...

1063
01:20:55.150 --> 01:20:58.410
You don't know that Joon-ho and I
are going out, do you?

1064
01:21:03.580 --> 01:21:05.250
We've been together for a while now.

1065
01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:08.620
Joon-ho said

1066
01:21:09.250 --> 01:21:11.840
he'd tell you eventually,

1067
01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:14.000
but...

1068
01:21:15.170 --> 01:21:17.760
I wanted to tell you first.

1069
01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:21.140
It's okay, right?

1070
01:21:22.010 --> 01:21:23.060
Je-hyeok?

1071
01:21:31.900 --> 01:21:32.980
I'm glad.

1072
01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:39.660
I'm glad it's Joon-ho.

1073
01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:46.870
If it were anyone else,
I would've killed the punk,

1074
01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:52.540
but thank goodness it's Joon-ho.

1075
01:21:54.590 --> 01:21:57.460
If it's Joon-ho, I can rest assured.

1076
01:22:05.470 --> 01:22:08.480
ESTABLISH ORDER,
FOSTER MORALITY

1077
01:22:13.860 --> 01:22:15.440
7102 Je-hyeok Kim.

1078
01:22:17.190 --> 01:22:18.320
Release.

1079
01:22:29.910 --> 01:22:32.170
What are you doing? Get out here.

1080
01:22:57.980 --> 01:22:59.280
Goodbye, Boss.

1081
01:23:00.990 --> 01:23:04.110
I'll never forget what you did for me.

1082
01:23:06.830 --> 01:23:08.200
I didn't do anything.

1083
01:23:11.870 --> 01:23:13.040
You were...

1084
01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:20.050
the first to treat me like a human being.

1085
01:23:23.090 --> 01:23:25.300
I was treated like a person
for the first time in here.

1086
01:23:36.980 --> 01:23:38.360
Thank you.

1087
01:24:01.510 --> 01:24:02.920
Good luck Je-hyeok Kim!

1088
01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:06.390
Je-hyeok Kim! You did great!

1089
01:24:06.510 --> 01:24:09.140
Good job, Je-hyeok Kim!

1090
01:24:11.220 --> 01:24:13.810
Goodbye! We'll always root for you!

1091
01:24:20.900 --> 01:24:22.280
Good luck Je-hyeok Kim!

1092
01:24:29.580 --> 01:24:31.330
Je-hyeok Kim is the best!

1093
01:24:37.290 --> 01:24:41.040
-Je-hyeok Kim!
-Je-hyeok Kim!

1094
01:24:41.130 --> 01:24:45.010
-Je-hyeok Kim!
-Je-hyeok Kim!

1095
01:24:45.090 --> 01:24:49.970
-Je-hyeok Kim!
-Je-hyeok Kim!

1096
01:24:50.050 --> 01:24:53.600
-Je-hyeok Kim!
-Je-hyeok Kim!

1097
01:24:54.060 --> 01:24:58.020
-Je-hyeok Kim!
-Je-hyeok Kim!

1098
01:24:58.350 --> 01:25:02.190
-Je-hyeok Kim!
-Je-hyeok Kim!

1099
01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:37.600
-Thanks.
-Let's go.

1100
01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:47.650
-He's coming.
-He's here.

1101
01:25:47.990 --> 01:25:49.910
-Congratulations!
-Please look this way!

1102
01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:56.580
-Je-hyeok Kim!
-This way, please!

1103
01:25:57.080 --> 01:25:58.290
-A word, please!
-Look this way!

1104
01:25:59.410 --> 01:26:01.120
-Over here!
-Are you returning to the mound?

1105
01:26:01.210 --> 01:26:03.170
Please tell us your plans!

1106
01:26:13.430 --> 01:26:15.350
Here's your tofu. Eat it all.

1107
01:26:17.140 --> 01:26:18.350
Good job.

1108
01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:20.270
Thank you.

1109
01:27:40.850 --> 01:27:43.310
HYOSEUNG GRADE SCHOOL

1110
01:27:44.310 --> 01:27:46.230
Today, we'll learn about

1111
01:27:46.310 --> 01:27:48.440
various occupations
with a special teacher, right?

1112
01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:49.400
-Yes!
-Yes!

1113
01:27:49.980 --> 01:27:51.440
Today's teacher

1114
01:27:51.530 --> 01:27:55.820
is Su-bin's father, Mr. Se-yun Paeng.

1115
01:27:56.620 --> 01:27:59.120
Mr. Paeng! Please come in!

1116
01:28:09.420 --> 01:28:10.750
Daddy.

1117
01:28:13.220 --> 01:28:15.260
Your daddy's uniform is super cool.

1118
01:28:20.180 --> 01:28:21.560
<i>Officer Se-yun Paeng.</i>

1119
01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:23.730
This person knows my dad.

1120
01:28:24.140 --> 01:28:25.890
<i>-Lieutenant Paeng.</i>
-You're right.

1121
01:28:25.980 --> 01:28:27.560
<i>-Thank you very much.</i>
-You're so lucky.

1122
01:28:28.860 --> 01:28:30.020
Hi there.

1123
01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:33.320
I'm Su-bin's dad.

1124
01:28:33.780 --> 01:28:35.860
I'm a corrections officer.

1125
01:28:37.700 --> 01:28:39.280
Nice to meet you guys.

1126
01:28:42.580 --> 01:28:44.830
You need to speak formally during class.

1127
01:28:44.910 --> 01:28:46.790
I see. I'm sorry.

1128
01:28:47.580 --> 01:28:49.330
It's a force of habit.

1129
01:28:50.750 --> 01:28:52.300
Honorary Teacher

1130
01:28:52.380 --> 01:28:53.840
Su-Bin's Dad, Se-Yun Paeng

1131
01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:58.340
Everyone, I work in a prison.

1132
01:28:59.220 --> 01:29:00.470
Who goes to prison?

1133
01:29:00.550 --> 01:29:02.350
People who do bad things!

1134
01:29:02.430 --> 01:29:03.720
That's right.

1135
01:29:04.310 --> 01:29:06.600
Bad people live in prison.

1136
01:29:07.270 --> 01:29:10.860
But everyone commits a bad act
at least once.

1137
01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:14.110
I help people denounce their crime

1138
01:29:14.190 --> 01:29:16.400
and repent. That's what we do.

1139
01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:25.910
I brought some things I use at work
in the prison.

1140
01:29:26.250 --> 01:29:27.210
Do you want to try?

1141
01:29:27.290 --> 01:29:28.250
-Yes!
-Yes!

1142
01:29:28.330 --> 01:29:30.250
Who wants to help me demonstrate?

1143
01:29:30.330 --> 01:29:31.790
-Me!
-Me!

1144
01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:36.300
Put the butterfly knot in the wrist,

1145
01:29:36.380 --> 01:29:38.130
and wrap it

1146
01:29:38.220 --> 01:29:42.720
around his body to prevent him
from moving his hands.

1147
01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:43.640
Ta-da!

1148
01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:49.560
Oh dear... Sorry... I'm so sorry.

1149
01:29:49.690 --> 01:29:52.690
I'm sorry. Did that hurt?

1150
01:29:52.770 --> 01:29:53.820
Sorry.

1151
01:29:56.440 --> 01:29:59.650
OCTOBER 2018

1152
01:30:14.500 --> 01:30:16.460
Excuse me, Je-hyeok Kim?

1153
01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:19.260
Where are you headed?

1154
01:30:19.380 --> 01:30:21.510
If you're going to Gocheok Dome,
I can give you a lift.

1155
01:30:21.590 --> 01:30:23.800
Just open the door, you bastard.

1156
01:30:32.770 --> 01:30:34.270
I'm so nervous.

1157
01:30:35.110 --> 01:30:36.320
You were called up.

1158
01:30:36.780 --> 01:30:39.070
To the Korean Series, moreover.

1159
01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:42.740
-I'm nervous too.
-Liar.

1160
01:30:44.120 --> 01:30:47.580
I'm really nervous too. I didn't sleep
a wink after getting the call last night.

1161
01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:50.540
You must mean it.

1162
01:30:53.670 --> 01:30:54.500
Are we there yet?

1163
01:30:54.630 --> 01:30:57.210
Yes. Once we get past that tunnel.

1164
01:30:58.340 --> 01:30:59.260
We've arrived.

1165
01:31:00.420 --> 01:31:02.220
That tunnel is super long.

1166
01:31:02.300 --> 01:31:03.720
I bet it's the longest in Seoul.

1167
01:31:04.470 --> 01:31:06.180
Hold your breath.

1168
01:31:07.850 --> 01:31:10.230
They say your wish will come true.

1169
01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:13.770
Come on.

1170
01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:16.860
I won't breathe.

1171
01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:20.610
I'll pray that you'll pitch well today,

1172
01:31:21.030 --> 01:31:23.490
and that you'll be the winning pitcher.

1173
01:32:18.920 --> 01:32:19.750
Je-hyeok.

1174
01:32:56.460 --> 01:32:58.630
JE-HYEOK KIM

1175
01:32:58.710 --> 01:33:00.670
<i>With Nexen behind 10 to 0,</i>

1176
01:33:00.750 --> 01:33:02.750
<i>Kia Tigers takes the bat
to start the eighth inning.</i>

1177
01:33:04.090 --> 01:33:07.340
<i>Kia Tigers and Nexen Heroes'
game one of the Korean Series.</i>

1178
01:33:07.430 --> 01:33:09.550
<i>I think they're going to the bullpen.</i>

1179
01:33:20.270 --> 01:33:23.070
<i>Finally, he's here. Je-hyeok Kim.</i>

1180
01:33:23.650 --> 01:33:26.700
<i>Everyone, Je-hyeok Kim
is finally taking the mound again.</i>

1181
01:33:26.820 --> 01:33:29.660
<i>This is an incredibly moving moment.</i>

1182
01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:33.370
<i>Je-hyeok Kim is back on the mound
after two years.</i>

1183
01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:39.960
JE-HYEOK KIM

1184
01:33:42.460 --> 01:33:43.420
All together!

1185
01:34:16.620 --> 01:34:17.700
<i>Next batter up.</i>

1186
01:34:55.080 --> 01:34:56.790
<i>-Bravo!
-Bravo!</i>

1187
01:35:01.710 --> 01:35:04.920
<i>Game one of the Korean Series,
held at Gocheok Dome,</i>

1188
01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:08.050
<i>ended with Kia Tigers winning 10 to 0.</i>

1189
01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:11.470
<i>However, notwithstanding
losing the first game,</i>

1190
01:35:11.550 --> 01:35:15.050
<i>Nexen had a more moving moment
than winning the game.</i>

1191
01:35:15.470 --> 01:35:18.810
<i>The Phoenix Je-hyeok Kim,
who had left baseball for two years,</i>

1192
01:35:18.890 --> 01:35:20.230
<i>took the mound again.</i>

1193
01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:25.110
<i>Although he was unable to get a win
in his comeback game,</i>

1194
01:35:25.190 --> 01:35:29.230
<i>he found his groove quickly,
and confirmed his potential for revival.</i>

1195
01:35:29.980 --> 01:35:33.110
<i>The 16,000 baseball fans
who filled Gocheok Dome</i>

1196
01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:35.740
<i>sang a new anthem for Kim,</i>

1197
01:35:35.820 --> 01:35:37.870
<i>and welcomed the return of a hero.</i>

1198
01:35:37.990 --> 01:35:39.120
<i>Next on the news.</i>

1199
01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:43.960
<i>Yesterday, the second trial for the case
that enraged the nation was held.</i>

1200
01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:47.170
<i>The court found Sergeant Oh,
who assaulted the victim until he died,</i>

1201
01:35:47.250 --> 01:35:50.800
<i>guilty of murder and sentenced him
to 35 years in prison.</i>

1202
01:35:51.260 --> 01:35:53.930
<i>The court stated that Sergeant Oh
was fully aware of the fact</i>

1203
01:35:54.010 --> 01:35:57.300
<i>that the victim may die from the assault
as he was assaulting him.</i>

1204
01:35:59.640 --> 01:36:00.720
Captain Yoo.

1205
01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:02.810
Congratulations.

1206
01:36:04.190 --> 01:36:05.270
Thank you.

1207
01:36:05.350 --> 01:36:07.110
You're almost there.

1208
01:36:08.020 --> 01:36:09.020
It's almost over.

1209
01:36:10.230 --> 01:36:11.570
Good luck.

1210
01:36:24.870 --> 01:36:26.040
Get dressed.

1211
01:36:29.630 --> 01:36:30.880
Don't lie there.

1212
01:36:31.920 --> 01:36:33.010
Okay?

1213
01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:38.180
Please do not start fights
or curse at each other.

1214
01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:40.220
Shut it, bastard.

1215
01:36:40.310 --> 01:36:42.720
If we were outside,
I'd knock you out with one punch.

1216
01:36:45.100 --> 01:36:46.940
You're begging for an extension,
aren't you?

1217
01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:50.610
Where should we meet, you asshole?

1218
01:36:51.770 --> 01:36:53.280
Sit down, you shithead.

1219
01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:56.320
Shut up and prepare for bed.

1220
01:37:12.840 --> 01:37:15.090
Everyone! In your cells!

1221
01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:19.300
All of Wing 2, in your cells.

1222
01:37:57.340 --> 01:37:58.800
Dong-ho!

1223
01:37:58.880 --> 01:37:59.800
Shit.

1224
01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:05.140
Hey! Shit. Hello?

1225
01:38:05.220 --> 01:38:06.810
Yes, yes.

1226
01:38:06.890 --> 01:38:09.100
I'll call you back. Sorry.

1227
01:38:09.230 --> 01:38:10.650
Yes. I thought it was a cell phone.

1228
01:38:17.900 --> 01:38:19.700
-I'm sorry.
-No, no.

1229
01:38:19.780 --> 01:38:21.070
Cue!

1230
01:38:21.160 --> 01:38:23.160
-No, after he takes it out!
-Not yet! No, no, no!

1231
01:38:25.290 --> 01:38:27.040
Why are you so quick?

1232
01:38:29.790 --> 01:38:31.460
How sad. You missed.

1233
01:38:34.040 --> 01:38:35.340
You missed again.

1234
01:38:37.210 --> 01:38:39.170
I do not feel pain.

1235
01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:41.970
I heard that you're...

1236
01:38:42.890 --> 01:38:46.100
That you've decided
to play baseball again?

1237
01:38:48.430 --> 01:38:49.480
Yes.

1238
01:38:51.890 --> 01:38:53.770
My coach showed up in my dream...

1239
01:38:55.820 --> 01:38:58.190
My late coach showed up in my dream

1240
01:38:59.110 --> 01:39:00.190
and said it was his dream.

1241
01:39:01.990 --> 01:39:03.110
I got it wrong.

1242
01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:04.570
-No.
-Again.

1243
01:39:04.660 --> 01:39:06.780
I guess this is the last time
we'll see that.

1244
01:39:08.290 --> 01:39:09.330
No, that's...

1245
01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:13.960
-He's back! Looney's back!
-Yes!

1246
01:39:14.210 --> 01:39:16.000
Looney's back!

1247
01:39:16.130 --> 01:39:18.250
I'm goofy. Goofy.

1248
01:39:18.340 --> 01:39:20.760
I'm wacky. Wacky.

1249
01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:22.010
Cut!

1250
01:39:23.260 --> 01:39:25.470
Let go, bastard! Let go!

1251
01:39:27.060 --> 01:39:28.850
Let go! Lieutenant Paeng!

1252
01:39:28.970 --> 01:39:31.520
Let go! Hey! Lieutenant Paeng!

1253
01:39:31.980 --> 01:39:32.980
Go! Why aren't you going?

1254
01:39:33.060 --> 01:39:35.560
Why are you making me do it again?

1255
01:39:36.150 --> 01:39:37.520
Why wouldn't you go?

1256
01:39:37.770 --> 01:39:40.110
I was hitting you to go.

1257
01:39:41.726 --> 01:39:47.720
Thank you for watching Prison Playbook!
