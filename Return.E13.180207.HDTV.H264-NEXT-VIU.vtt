1
00:00:05.968 --> 00:00:07.598
Previously on Return.

2
00:00:08.838 --> 00:00:11.668
You are under arrest for murdering and abandoning the body of Ms. Yum.

3
00:00:11.668 --> 00:00:13.738
I'm your attorney, Mr. Kang.

4
00:00:13.738 --> 00:00:15.738
I'll clear your name first.

5
00:00:15.738 --> 00:00:17.608
In Ho didn't murder her.

6
00:00:17.608 --> 00:00:19.878
What is your real reason behind killing Yum Mi Jung?

7
00:00:19.878 --> 00:00:22.017
Joon Hee is alive.

8
00:00:22.017 --> 00:00:24.817
Where did it all go wrong?

9
00:00:26.418 --> 00:00:28.458
(Episode 13)

10
00:00:36.767 --> 00:00:38.898
Hey, have you gone mad?

11
00:00:39.627 --> 00:00:41.167
You came an hour late.

12
00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:44.608
The taxi driver looked at me suspiciously.

13
00:00:45.208 --> 00:00:46.337
What about Kim Byung Gi?

14
00:00:47.708 --> 00:00:49.847
He's been calling and texting me.

15
00:00:49.847 --> 00:00:51.508
He's throwing a tantrum.

16
00:00:52.148 --> 00:00:53.718
Until when do you want me to ignore him?

17
00:00:54.877 --> 00:00:57.947
What will you do if he gets angry and goes to the police?

18
00:00:58.818 --> 00:01:00.788
Then he wouldn't get his two million dollars.

19
00:01:03.127 --> 00:01:04.487
Do you want me to keep ignoring him?

20
00:01:04.858 --> 00:01:07.657
If that's what you want, why are we here?

21
00:01:08.028 --> 00:01:10.297
Stay quiet, will you?

22
00:01:27.317 --> 00:01:28.578
(Druggie)

23
00:01:31.287 --> 00:01:33.287
- Should I take it? - Wait.

24
00:01:33.517 --> 00:01:34.588
How long?

25
00:01:37.188 --> 00:01:40.228
Get off the car right now, and walk there.

26
00:01:40.627 --> 00:01:43.498
When he hangs up, call him again right away.

27
00:01:45.267 --> 00:01:47.698
Why is it so complicated?

28
00:01:47.767 --> 00:01:49.097
What did I tell you a while ago?

29
00:01:51.608 --> 00:01:53.938
What? The car accident?

30
00:01:54.007 --> 00:01:56.948
Right. There's a money bag in the trunk. Take it.

31
00:02:00.918 --> 00:02:01.918
Do you think...

32
00:02:03.987 --> 00:02:04.987
I'm an idiot?

33
00:02:06.047 --> 00:02:08.058
Do just as I say.

34
00:02:11.887 --> 00:02:12.958
All right.

35
00:02:14.898 --> 00:02:16.298
All right.

36
00:02:16.768 --> 00:02:17.798
All right.

37
00:02:29.278 --> 00:02:32.907
How dare he? Is he out of his mind?

38
00:02:34.447 --> 00:02:35.947
(Abuser)

39
00:02:39.618 --> 00:02:40.618
What's wrong with you?

40
00:02:40.817 --> 00:02:43.688
Well, listen. I got into a car accident on my way.

41
00:02:43.787 --> 00:02:45.458
Jerk. So what happened?

42
00:02:45.887 --> 00:02:48.528
I just got off the taxi. I'm walking there now.

43
00:02:49.398 --> 00:02:50.398
Where are you?

44
00:02:50.597 --> 00:02:53.968
Where do you think? We were supposed to meet at the underpass.

45
00:03:00.407 --> 00:03:01.438
My gosh.

46
00:03:12.988 --> 00:03:14.357
You punk.

47
00:03:16.588 --> 00:03:18.827
So you didn't get hurt, did you?

48
00:03:19.827 --> 00:03:23.827
My dash cam, GPS, and the memory card.

49
00:03:24.298 --> 00:03:25.298
Bring them to me.

50
00:03:45.287 --> 00:03:46.317
Come on.

51
00:03:53.097 --> 00:03:54.227
Do you want to check?

52
00:03:54.597 --> 00:03:55.597
I should trust you.

53
00:03:55.857 --> 00:03:57.627
That's right.

54
00:03:58.498 --> 00:04:02.197
Think about the time we spent together.

55
00:04:04.338 --> 00:04:07.107
You didn't save the file or anything, right?

56
00:04:07.107 --> 00:04:08.208
No way.

57
00:04:09.107 --> 00:04:12.178
You know that I'm not that big of a slime ball.

58
00:04:12.178 --> 00:04:15.417
Are you serious right now, jerk?

59
00:04:15.678 --> 00:04:17.447
How dare you talk to me so rudely?

60
00:04:17.848 --> 00:04:20.587
Hey, am I your friend?

61
00:04:21.488 --> 00:04:22.488
Am I?

62
00:04:23.988 --> 00:04:24.988
Hey.

63
00:04:28.897 --> 00:04:30.027
Let me slap you...

64
00:04:30.998 --> 00:04:33.038
for one last time and wrap this up.

65
00:04:34.538 --> 00:04:36.238
I gave you a lot of money too.

66
00:04:36.438 --> 00:04:39.168
This one is worth two million dollars. Okay?

67
00:04:39.438 --> 00:04:41.808
Just... Just one slap then.

68
00:04:42.637 --> 00:04:43.647
Come.

69
00:04:45.348 --> 00:04:46.577
Go easy on me.

70
00:04:47.418 --> 00:04:48.678
You punk.

71
00:05:06.197 --> 00:05:07.238
Shot.

72
00:05:34.358 --> 00:05:35.358
Hey.

73
00:05:38.428 --> 00:05:40.998
You didn't say you were actually going to kill him.

74
00:05:41.267 --> 00:05:43.038
I said I wouldn't run him over with a car.

75
00:05:43.038 --> 00:05:44.707
I didn't say I wouldn't kill him.

76
00:05:47.808 --> 00:05:48.837
I guess you're right.

77
00:05:54.978 --> 00:05:56.488
Put him in the sack, and drag him back.

78
00:05:57.447 --> 00:06:00.017
Do it before he bleeds more. He's bleeding a lot.

79
00:06:01.317 --> 00:06:02.618
Why do I...

80
00:06:16.438 --> 00:06:17.467
Right.

81
00:06:18.707 --> 00:06:21.178
You even killed a man.

82
00:06:23.248 --> 00:06:25.808
I didn't kill a man yet.

83
00:06:26.447 --> 00:06:28.248
I should be doing it.

84
00:06:39.358 --> 00:06:41.897
Was this jerk this tall?

85
00:06:43.598 --> 00:06:45.127
Darn it.

86
00:06:59.717 --> 00:07:00.717
My back hurts.

87
00:07:01.717 --> 00:07:02.748
Gosh, it's killing me.

88
00:07:15.498 --> 00:07:16.498
My gosh!

89
00:07:17.228 --> 00:07:18.228
Gosh.

90
00:07:20.697 --> 00:07:21.897
What's this?

91
00:07:21.998 --> 00:07:23.038
It's an alibi.

92
00:07:41.788 --> 00:07:42.817
What's that?

93
00:07:44.587 --> 00:07:45.658
Wait.

94
00:07:46.697 --> 00:07:48.197
I think we should turn back.

95
00:07:48.998 --> 00:07:49.998
Your face.

96
00:07:50.798 --> 00:07:51.798
Right.

97
00:07:52.998 --> 00:07:54.337
Darn it.

98
00:08:05.147 --> 00:08:07.418
Hey, do something.

99
00:08:15.788 --> 00:08:16.788
Hey,

100
00:08:17.688 --> 00:08:18.788
why don't we...

101
00:08:19.757 --> 00:08:22.428
run over all of them?

102
00:08:25.467 --> 00:08:26.467
Let's go.

103
00:08:31.438 --> 00:08:32.467
Go on.

104
00:08:44.987 --> 00:08:47.388
My dear officers.

105
00:08:47.788 --> 00:08:49.587
You're working hard.

106
00:08:49.688 --> 00:08:52.558
Excuse us, sir. A soldier ran away from the nearby army base.

107
00:08:52.558 --> 00:08:54.158
We will have to inspect your car.

108
00:08:58.298 --> 00:08:59.668
What's that smell?

109
00:09:01.367 --> 00:09:04.538
We were asked to hunt down the animals damaging the farms,

110
00:09:04.538 --> 00:09:06.938
so we're on our way to dispose the bodies after the hunt.

111
00:09:07.707 --> 00:09:09.038
Let me check the trunk.

112
00:09:09.308 --> 00:09:10.308
Sure.

113
00:09:12.077 --> 00:09:16.847
My gosh, they work really hard, don't they?

114
00:09:17.388 --> 00:09:20.388
They deserve to get paid more.

115
00:09:21.617 --> 00:09:23.087
I will talk to the higher-ups.

116
00:09:38.538 --> 00:09:39.538
There...

117
00:09:40.408 --> 00:09:41.878
was my phone.

118
00:09:43.648 --> 00:09:45.607
I thought I lost it.

119
00:09:48.447 --> 00:09:49.847
I didn't know it'd be there.

120
00:09:50.817 --> 00:09:52.847
Why is my phone in the trunk?

121
00:10:10.638 --> 00:10:12.707
- You may pass. - Thank you.

122
00:10:13.607 --> 00:10:14.607
Let them go.

123
00:10:32.258 --> 00:10:33.997
My heart is racing.

124
00:11:14.597 --> 00:11:15.768
Where do you want to bury the body?

125
00:11:16.737 --> 00:11:18.707
This is your family's property, so you should know better.

126
00:11:18.707 --> 00:11:20.477
We have plenty of vacant lots.

127
00:11:20.707 --> 00:11:22.138
Just bury him anywhere.

128
00:11:57.648 --> 00:11:59.378
I didn't know you'd really kill him.

129
00:12:00.878 --> 00:12:02.747
You said you wanted to kill him.

130
00:12:03.188 --> 00:12:05.847
Do we have to go this far?

131
00:12:06.487 --> 00:12:08.357
To be honest, we didn't do anything wrong.

132
00:12:09.658 --> 00:12:11.827
It's the same with what happened with Joon Hee too.

133
00:12:11.987 --> 00:12:13.898
Things keep getting complicated.

134
00:12:14.697 --> 00:12:17.898
If we only didn't bury Mi Jung's body...

135
00:12:17.898 --> 00:12:18.898
No.

136
00:12:20.237 --> 00:12:21.737
Just like Joon Hee said,

137
00:12:23.168 --> 00:12:25.438
if we corrected our mistake then,

138
00:12:25.638 --> 00:12:27.678
we wouldn't have to kill him.

139
00:12:27.678 --> 00:12:28.707
It's cold. Let's go.

140
00:12:49.357 --> 00:12:50.567
That's blood.

141
00:12:51.227 --> 00:12:52.227
Yes.

142
00:12:54.097 --> 00:12:55.237
I went hunting.

143
00:12:55.867 --> 00:12:56.867
It felt great...

144
00:12:58.067 --> 00:12:59.067
to kill.

145
00:12:59.737 --> 00:13:01.077
I... I see.

146
00:13:22.101 --> 00:13:27.101
<font color="#fcc89b">[VIU Ver] E13 Return "You Talked to Him?"</font>
<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

147
00:13:49.388 --> 00:13:53.327
Exactly. Come on. Let's go now. Put your knife down.

148
00:13:53.497 --> 00:13:54.798
Your business was suspended...

149
00:13:54.798 --> 00:13:56.668
for violating Food Sanitation Regulation.

150
00:13:59.097 --> 00:14:01.337
You just tried to intimidate me with your eyes, didn't you?

151
00:14:01.768 --> 00:14:02.768
First warning.

152
00:14:03.837 --> 00:14:05.938
Is that how you're going to treat a small-business owner like myself?

153
00:14:05.938 --> 00:14:07.207
You're with the police.

154
00:14:08.038 --> 00:14:11.508
My gosh. You're getting on my nerves.

155
00:14:11.747 --> 00:14:14.018
You should know better. Why are you doing this to me?

156
00:14:15.817 --> 00:14:18.587
You're threatening a police officer with a knife.

157
00:14:18.587 --> 00:14:20.788
- Second warning. - Are you kidding me right now?

158
00:14:22.258 --> 00:14:24.158
What are you going to do with that? What?

159
00:14:24.658 --> 00:14:25.888
Third warning.

160
00:14:29.827 --> 00:14:33.398
Didn't I tell you I'd break your fingers if you use the taser again?

161
00:14:33.467 --> 00:14:35.298
The higher-ups warned us to refrain...

162
00:14:35.298 --> 00:14:38.638
from using the taser gun because of the death caused by the taser gun.

163
00:14:39.837 --> 00:14:42.878
Do you want to be reprimanded again for excessive use of force?

164
00:14:42.878 --> 00:14:44.947
- Dong Bae, that jerk... - See?

165
00:14:45.707 --> 00:14:48.178
I don't have a partner anymore, and it's already showing.

166
00:14:52.587 --> 00:14:55.688
Hyun Bae, this is all my fault.

167
00:14:56.217 --> 00:14:58.827
Can't you fix Dong Bae's problem?

168
00:14:59.798 --> 00:15:01.327
What is that jerk up to now?

169
00:15:03.597 --> 00:15:04.668
Well done.

170
00:15:08.737 --> 00:15:09.837
Hey, Dong Bae.

171
00:15:11.107 --> 00:15:12.107
Where are you now?

172
00:15:12.808 --> 00:15:13.808
I'm in Busan.

173
00:15:14.737 --> 00:15:17.947
- Why are you in Busan? - I wanted to get some fresh air.

174
00:15:17.947 --> 00:15:20.347
Do you think this is a good time for you to get some fresh air?

175
00:15:20.447 --> 00:15:22.747
What is it? Did they finish their investigation?

176
00:15:22.747 --> 00:15:25.347
Forget about the investigation. Come back here until I count to 10.

177
00:15:26.388 --> 00:15:27.388
Okay.

178
00:15:29.788 --> 00:15:31.128
(Myoungseong Theological University)

179
00:15:31.128 --> 00:15:33.298
This is Dante's most famous work, "Divine Comedy".

180
00:15:33.758 --> 00:15:34.928
In this poem,

181
00:15:34.928 --> 00:15:38.697
we are faced with a world we have never experienced before.

182
00:15:38.867 --> 00:15:40.697
Especially, in "Inferno",

183
00:15:40.697 --> 00:15:43.467
you will notice that Dante wrote the poem...

184
00:15:43.467 --> 00:15:45.567
as if he had personal experience in such place.

185
00:15:45.837 --> 00:15:47.837
"Divine Comedy" by Dante...

186
00:15:47.837 --> 00:15:49.107
is an example...

187
00:15:49.107 --> 00:15:52.747
that showed we can relate to the words of Bible at a deeper level.

188
00:15:53.117 --> 00:15:54.247
This is all.

189
00:15:56.018 --> 00:15:58.587
Don't clap.

190
00:15:59.548 --> 00:16:00.888
(Tae Suk)

191
00:16:01.357 --> 00:16:02.717
Are we having a talent show?

192
00:16:02.758 --> 00:16:03.758
(Tae Suk)

193
00:16:04.827 --> 00:16:05.857
Is that it?

194
00:16:06.898 --> 00:16:07.898
Next.

195
00:16:10.028 --> 00:16:12.928
I will deliver my presentation for "Purgatory.

196
00:16:13.367 --> 00:16:16.508
In the Bible, the term, "purgatory", does not come up.

197
00:16:16.508 --> 00:16:19.878
Yet, all of us are familiar with the term.

198
00:16:24.178 --> 00:16:25.607
Continue.

199
00:16:26.778 --> 00:16:28.278
According to the researches,

200
00:16:28.278 --> 00:16:31.217
the term, "purgatory", was first used in the 12th century.

201
00:16:31.247 --> 00:16:32.288
(Tae Suk)

202
00:16:36.087 --> 00:16:39.128
Hey, why can't you stay focused?

203
00:16:39.587 --> 00:16:40.957
Just continue.

204
00:16:42.957 --> 00:16:44.367
(Tae Suk)

205
00:16:45.528 --> 00:16:46.837
(Power-off)

206
00:17:13.257 --> 00:17:16.527
Go fool around for 10 minutes.

207
00:17:30.947 --> 00:17:31.977
Hey.

208
00:17:35.318 --> 00:17:37.717
What's wrong with you? What's going on?

209
00:17:38.447 --> 00:17:41.057
Are you dodging my calls? Is that it?

210
00:17:41.918 --> 00:17:43.487
Well... That's...

211
00:17:45.727 --> 00:17:47.527
It's just... My goodness.

212
00:17:48.797 --> 00:17:51.898
I... I mean, this is weird. So...

213
00:17:53.938 --> 00:17:56.138
You're a bit scary.

214
00:17:56.197 --> 00:17:57.568
What are you saying?

215
00:17:57.568 --> 00:18:00.537
Well... You...

216
00:18:01.938 --> 00:18:03.277
You're not yourself.

217
00:18:03.277 --> 00:18:06.848
What I'm saying is that you are my friend, Oh Tae Suk.

218
00:18:07.178 --> 00:18:11.787
But you... You are not yourself.

219
00:18:11.787 --> 00:18:13.418
Hey, hey, hey!

220
00:18:16.017 --> 00:18:17.588
Get your act together.

221
00:18:18.057 --> 00:18:19.388
With the slightest mistake,

222
00:18:19.828 --> 00:18:22.257
the attempted murder of Joon Hee and the murder of Kim Byung Gi.

223
00:18:23.168 --> 00:18:25.168
You'll take the fall for both crimes.

224
00:18:25.727 --> 00:18:26.767
Me?

225
00:18:27.767 --> 00:18:28.767
Why?

226
00:18:28.938 --> 00:18:32.007
Hey, let's be honest here.

227
00:18:32.638 --> 00:18:34.977
If we transferred Joon Hee to the hospital when it happened,

228
00:18:34.977 --> 00:18:37.277
he wouldn't have been hurt that badly.

229
00:18:37.947 --> 00:18:41.017
Besides, you are the one who killed...

230
00:18:46.118 --> 00:18:47.358
Who would believe you?

231
00:18:49.287 --> 00:18:51.358
What Joon Hee remembers...

232
00:18:51.457 --> 00:18:54.057
is that you smashed his head with a rock.

233
00:18:54.158 --> 00:18:56.368
That's his only memory.

234
00:18:57.428 --> 00:18:58.828
What about Kim Byung Gi?

235
00:18:59.227 --> 00:19:01.697
1 million each. I want 2 million dollars in total.

236
00:19:03.037 --> 00:19:05.467
I wasn't the one he blackmailed.

237
00:19:10.148 --> 00:19:11.178
It was you.

238
00:19:16.247 --> 00:19:17.287
Bum.

239
00:19:17.947 --> 00:19:19.348
My good boy, Bum .

240
00:19:20.318 --> 00:19:21.517
What will you do now?

241
00:19:22.858 --> 00:19:24.088
Will you trust me...

242
00:19:25.658 --> 00:19:26.898
and follow my lead?

243
00:19:47.247 --> 00:19:48.318
But...

244
00:19:50.188 --> 00:19:51.787
what will you do with Joon Hee?

245
00:19:53.618 --> 00:19:54.957
What choice do we have?

246
00:19:56.217 --> 00:19:57.287
He must never...

247
00:19:59.158 --> 00:20:00.697
wake up.

248
00:20:08.697 --> 00:20:09.938
Have a meal before you go.

249
00:20:18.148 --> 00:20:20.348
Let's pass this quietly, Joon Hee.

250
00:20:33.957 --> 00:20:35.797
Make sure no visitors get inside.

251
00:20:39.297 --> 00:20:41.497
As there are people everywhere,

252
00:20:42.068 --> 00:20:44.068
indiscretion is everywhere.

253
00:20:58.818 --> 00:20:59.918
Hello.

254
00:21:00.088 --> 00:21:02.957
Is this the detective on Kang In Ho's case?

255
00:21:03.227 --> 00:21:04.388
Yes, this is he.

256
00:21:05.757 --> 00:21:06.997
If you want to find a missing person,

257
00:21:06.997 --> 00:21:08.957
you must contact the appropriate department.

258
00:21:09.297 --> 00:21:10.668
Why did you contact me?

259
00:21:10.898 --> 00:21:12.997
It's hard to explain logically.

260
00:21:14.297 --> 00:21:16.537
But I think it's related to that incident.

261
00:21:18.807 --> 00:21:19.938
Tell me.

262
00:21:22.237 --> 00:21:23.277
(3 days ago)

263
00:21:23.277 --> 00:21:25.477
The first trial will be held in a week for Mr. K...

264
00:21:25.477 --> 00:21:29.378
of T Group, who recently caused a stir in the society.

265
00:21:29.547 --> 00:21:31.217
Don't change the channel.

266
00:21:31.217 --> 00:21:34.057
On December 4, Mr. K murdered...

267
00:21:34.057 --> 00:21:36.088
Ms. Yum, whose body was found on a road in Paju.

268
00:21:36.088 --> 00:21:37.928
- It's time to watch the drama. - He's arrested...

269
00:21:37.928 --> 00:21:39.898
and charged for murder and the abandonment of a corpse.

270
00:21:39.898 --> 00:21:41.997
- I am about to win the lottery. - The prosecution...

271
00:21:41.997 --> 00:21:43.967
is paying attention to the fact that...

272
00:21:43.967 --> 00:21:46.598
Mr. K and the late Ms. Yum were having an affair.

273
00:21:48.297 --> 00:21:49.767
- "Lottery"? - Yes.

274
00:21:50.537 --> 00:21:53.307
He said that while watching the news about Kang In Ho.

275
00:21:56.338 --> 00:21:57.947
He said In Ho was a two-million-dollar lottery ticket.

276
00:21:58.178 --> 00:22:00.247
He said he'd get two million dollars if he scratches it.

277
00:22:00.517 --> 00:22:03.487
He even told me to pack to go abroad.

278
00:22:08.987 --> 00:22:10.858
(Gangdong Precinct)

279
00:22:24.037 --> 00:22:25.037
What is it?

280
00:22:26.307 --> 00:22:27.938
Why are you just standing there?

281
00:22:29.608 --> 00:22:31.947
Will you go and start working? Come on.

282
00:22:34.118 --> 00:22:35.217
What should I start with?

283
00:22:37.118 --> 00:22:38.348
Organize your desk first.

284
00:22:39.918 --> 00:22:40.918
Okay, sir.

285
00:22:52.797 --> 00:22:53.797
He's that dealer.

286
00:22:53.967 --> 00:22:57.037
The day Seo Joon Hee went missing, he confirmed Kim Hak Bum's alibi.

287
00:22:57.307 --> 00:22:58.467
He went missing after that.

288
00:22:59.037 --> 00:23:01.507
- What? -Put his car on the wanted list...

289
00:23:02.438 --> 00:23:04.947
and check what Hak Bum did on the day he went missing.

290
00:23:05.947 --> 00:23:06.947
Okay, sir.

291
00:23:13.057 --> 00:23:14.888
Hello, Professor Kim.

292
00:23:15.118 --> 00:23:17.557
- Hello. - Byung Gi is not here today.

293
00:23:17.688 --> 00:23:19.658
Did you make an appointment with him?

294
00:23:21.027 --> 00:23:22.757
- Yes. - Did you talk with him?

295
00:23:23.027 --> 00:23:25.398
I haven't seen him for days. His phone is off too.

296
00:23:25.398 --> 00:23:26.438
Who said that?

297
00:23:27.297 --> 00:23:29.197
When did I say that I talked to him on the phone?

298
00:23:29.297 --> 00:23:32.438
- You just said... - You're mad.

299
00:23:33.237 --> 00:23:34.737
I was supposed to see him a few days ago.

300
00:23:35.977 --> 00:23:36.977
Is he not here?

301
00:23:37.078 --> 00:23:40.477
Yes. Should I call him again?

302
00:23:40.547 --> 00:23:42.777
Never mind. I will look around alone.

303
00:23:42.918 --> 00:23:43.987
- All right. - Go.

304
00:23:53.027 --> 00:23:55.257
Is Mr. Kim Byung Gi here?

305
00:24:02.497 --> 00:24:04.868
My goodness. Professor Kim.

306
00:24:07.838 --> 00:24:11.477
We met at my office party before.

307
00:24:11.947 --> 00:24:12.947
Right.

308
00:24:14.418 --> 00:24:15.447
Why are you here?

309
00:24:15.717 --> 00:24:18.088
I have an appointment with a car dealer.

310
00:24:18.517 --> 00:24:20.918
You have an appointment with Byung Gi?

311
00:24:20.918 --> 00:24:23.628
Yes. Do you know him well?

312
00:24:24.828 --> 00:24:27.797
No. It's nothing.

313
00:24:29.497 --> 00:24:31.928
By the way, is it really Kim Byung Gi?

314
00:24:33.638 --> 00:24:36.807
Yes. I just talked to him. We're supposed to meet here.

315
00:24:39.537 --> 00:24:41.807
You talked to him? With Byung Gi?

316
00:24:42.338 --> 00:24:43.348
Yes.

317
00:24:45.648 --> 00:24:46.648
Are you all right?

318
00:24:47.418 --> 00:24:48.418
What?

319
00:24:48.918 --> 00:24:50.717
You've gone pale.

320
00:24:56.757 --> 00:24:59.757
Good choice. This is Kim Byung Gi.

321
00:25:00.027 --> 00:25:02.027
I will serve you a good car.

322
00:25:03.598 --> 00:25:04.898
What's going on?

323
00:25:06.297 --> 00:25:08.138
Is he really alive?

324
00:25:09.807 --> 00:25:11.737
How can a dead man call?

325
00:25:13.777 --> 00:25:15.438
Wait. Wait.

326
00:25:17.247 --> 00:25:18.878
We turned off his phone,

327
00:25:19.878 --> 00:25:22.118
and we buried it with his body.

328
00:25:22.977 --> 00:25:24.088
My goodness.

329
00:25:25.118 --> 00:25:27.318
Do I have to check Choi Ja Hye's phone?

330
00:25:27.957 --> 00:25:29.088
Darn it.

331
00:25:41.168 --> 00:25:42.168
Why don't we...

332
00:25:42.938 --> 00:25:44.168
go for a cup of tea?

333
00:25:44.408 --> 00:25:45.438
What?

334
00:25:46.068 --> 00:25:47.237
I just wanted to.

335
00:25:48.777 --> 00:25:49.777
Sure.

336
00:25:52.348 --> 00:25:53.918
What do you want to say?

337
00:25:53.918 --> 00:25:55.578
Well...

338
00:25:57.648 --> 00:25:59.918
I am curious about In Ho's trial.

339
00:26:03.527 --> 00:26:04.828
Are you happy...

340
00:26:06.027 --> 00:26:07.057
that your friend is undergoing a trial?

341
00:26:08.027 --> 00:26:09.057
That's not it.

342
00:26:10.898 --> 00:26:13.438
The trial is proceeding well.

343
00:26:13.537 --> 00:26:14.537
I see.

344
00:26:17.438 --> 00:26:19.068
Is there anything else you want to say?

345
00:26:19.068 --> 00:26:20.678
About Byung Gi...

346
00:26:22.078 --> 00:26:23.207
How do you know him?

347
00:26:23.648 --> 00:26:27.118
I wanted to get a new car, and someone introduced him to me.

348
00:26:27.447 --> 00:26:30.118
So? You're supposed to meet him today?

349
00:26:30.247 --> 00:26:32.348
Why are you curious about that?

350
00:26:34.517 --> 00:26:37.128
I am your fan.

351
00:26:39.858 --> 00:26:42.358
Are you really supposed to see Byung Gi?

352
00:26:43.628 --> 00:26:47.497
I usually don't respect anyone who's rude to me.

353
00:26:47.497 --> 00:26:50.267
But since you seem impatient, I will let it slide once.

354
00:26:50.938 --> 00:26:53.037
Here's the answer to your question.

355
00:26:55.007 --> 00:26:56.237
I only talked to him on the phone.

356
00:26:57.178 --> 00:26:58.178
Today?

357
00:26:58.247 --> 00:26:59.247
Yes.

358
00:27:04.447 --> 00:27:06.858
If you're curious about Byung Gi,

359
00:27:07.217 --> 00:27:10.757
you can call him yourself.

360
00:27:11.428 --> 00:27:14.928
I have it saved in my phone. You should use it if you need it.

361
00:27:16.767 --> 00:27:18.628
I will use the ladies' room.

362
00:27:43.858 --> 00:27:45.987
What would a smart girl like her...

363
00:27:46.757 --> 00:27:50.197
set as her password?

364
00:27:53.868 --> 00:27:55.197
Gosh.

365
00:27:57.537 --> 00:27:59.108
030200.

366
00:28:00.507 --> 00:28:01.507
03...

367
00:28:06.247 --> 00:28:07.578
What are you doing?

368
00:28:08.477 --> 00:28:09.547
Are you playing with me?

369
00:28:09.648 --> 00:28:11.447
What is it that you want to ask me?

370
00:28:11.517 --> 00:28:15.918
Did you really talk to Byung Gi on the phone?

371
00:28:17.158 --> 00:28:18.227
Never mind.

372
00:28:18.957 --> 00:28:19.997
Hey.

373
00:28:20.598 --> 00:28:24.767
Let me see your phone just once. Okay?

374
00:28:26.227 --> 00:28:29.168
You are so sure that he can't be reached.

375
00:28:30.868 --> 00:28:34.078
I don't know what happened between you and him.

376
00:28:34.237 --> 00:28:36.547
But I hope it wasn't anything bad.

377
00:28:37.447 --> 00:28:38.447
I have to...

378
00:28:39.717 --> 00:28:43.447
go prepare for the trial of your friend, Kang In Ho.

379
00:28:58.967 --> 00:29:00.197
This is embarrassing.

380
00:29:07.408 --> 00:29:10.078
Why would he put his car there?

381
00:29:11.507 --> 00:29:12.777
It doesn't feel good.

382
00:29:14.078 --> 00:29:15.078
I know.

383
00:29:36.737 --> 00:29:38.168
This is not enough...

384
00:29:38.908 --> 00:29:40.537
to confirm murder.

385
00:29:41.378 --> 00:29:42.438
Did you check the CCTV footages?

386
00:29:42.678 --> 00:29:46.247
There are too many blind spots, so it's hard to trace the car.

387
00:30:04.868 --> 00:30:05.868
What is it?

388
00:30:06.027 --> 00:30:07.068
It's asphalt concrete.

389
00:30:08.237 --> 00:30:09.537
It's the material used to surface roads.

390
00:30:11.807 --> 00:30:14.378
Is there any nearby road getting reworked?

391
00:30:14.378 --> 00:30:15.777
I am not sure.

392
00:30:20.118 --> 00:30:22.517
(Episode 14 will air shortly.)
