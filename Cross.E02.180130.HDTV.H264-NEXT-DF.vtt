4
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.990
I can't forgive the man
who killed my father...

5
00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.684
but I can't...

6
00:00:29.684 --> 00:00:33.247
forgive you for what
you did to In Joo either.

7
00:00:33.247 --> 00:00:38.379
I'm going to get my revenge in the
cruelest, and most painful way.

8
00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:40.009
I'll do it...

9
00:00:41.934 --> 00:00:43.658
with my own hands.

10
00:00:45.803 --> 00:00:47.640
Revenge?

11
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.249
The reality is that you overmedicated
a patient with excessive bleeding

12
00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:53.910
and caused his heart failure.
Get a hold of yourself.

13
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.416
The fact that you're at that prison
and your malpractice alone...

14
00:00:57.416 --> 00:01:01.101
are enough to strip you
of your medical license.

15
00:01:02.428 --> 00:01:05.526
If you really want revenge,
why don't you take it now?

16
00:01:05.526 --> 00:01:08.017
It's just you and me in this room.

17
00:01:10.931 --> 00:01:12.359
Scalpel.

18
00:01:27.202 --> 00:01:28.761
Scalpel.

19
00:01:54.446 --> 00:01:55.901
Scalpel.

20
00:02:10.966 --> 00:02:13.402
Let me just ask you one thing.

21
00:02:13.402 --> 00:02:14.969
What is it?

22
00:02:15.931 --> 00:02:19.012
Why did you donate In Joo's organs?

23
00:02:21.341 --> 00:02:23.119
I already told you

24
00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:26.466
that I wanted to let her
live on in another body.

25
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.252
Is that really the only reason?

26
00:02:31.252 --> 00:02:34.611
- What do you mean?
- Didn't you have another motive?

27
00:02:36.436 --> 00:02:40.281
Are you suggesting
that I planned all of it?

28
00:02:41.835 --> 00:02:44.699
- Because she had a rare blood type...
- Kang In Kyu.

29
00:02:52.746 --> 00:02:54.470
The hospital called...

30
00:03:06.957 --> 00:03:10.921
A TA patient is brain-dead,
so they're donating the organs.

31
00:03:14.881 --> 00:03:16.478
Put it up to my ear.

32
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.355
Hello?

33
00:03:19.636 --> 00:03:21.372
What about the
Brain Death Decision Committee?

34
00:03:21.372 --> 00:03:23.386
<i>The meeting just ended.
The extraction is tomorrow.</i>

35
00:03:23.386 --> 00:03:24.948
Okay, I'll be right there.

36
00:03:53.249 --> 00:03:56.150
Think about how In Joo and your father...

37
00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.472
would've wanted you to live your life.

38
00:04:00.371 --> 00:04:04.512
And think about why you wanted
to become a doctor in the first place.

39
00:04:34.928 --> 00:04:36.416
Really?

40
00:04:37.371 --> 00:04:40.830
Okay, I got it. I'll be right down.

41
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.092
Okay.

42
00:04:44.337 --> 00:04:48.359
Our hospital has the
kidney incentive program, right?

43
00:04:48.359 --> 00:04:50.902
Yes, we have it.

44
00:04:50.902 --> 00:04:54.686
The congressman's wife said
that she found a liver donor...

45
00:04:54.686 --> 00:04:56.436
so we just need to do the surgery.

46
00:04:56.436 --> 00:04:57.436
Pardon?

47
00:04:57.436 --> 00:05:00.767
I heard that there's a brain-dead
patient at our hospital right now.

48
00:05:00.767 --> 00:05:04.097
Since the kidney
belongs to our hospital...

49
00:05:04.097 --> 00:05:07.808
let's do a simultaneous
liver and kidney transplant.

50
00:05:07.808 --> 00:05:10.325
Oh, sure.

51
00:05:17.522 --> 00:05:22.262
Should we entrust
this surgery with Doctor Lee?

52
00:05:22.859 --> 00:05:25.945
- Are you talking about Joo Hyuk?
- If not for him

53
00:05:25.945 --> 00:05:29.871
who else would we
entrust with this surgery?

54
00:05:29.871 --> 00:05:32.056
If we leave it to the center chief

55
00:05:32.056 --> 00:05:35.948
he'll probably stir up a fuss
about hospital regulations.

56
00:05:37.248 --> 00:05:39.306
If you're willing to do that...

57
00:05:40.618 --> 00:05:42.472
Thank you.

58
00:05:42.472 --> 00:05:45.912
I'll let Doctor Lee know.

59
00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:55.837
How do you know that doctor back there?
I didn't like how he was looking at you.

60
00:05:55.837 --> 00:05:58.077
Has Patient Kim Soon Nam arrived?

61
00:06:06.616 --> 00:06:08.469
Yes, he has arrived.

62
00:06:36.395 --> 00:06:39.190
What's wrong with you? I said no!

63
00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:41.647
- Just this once.
- I said no!

64
00:06:41.647 --> 00:06:43.548
Do you have a conscience?

65
00:06:44.053 --> 00:06:46.397
Please, just this once!

66
00:06:46.397 --> 00:06:49.957
- I said no!
- What's the matter?

67
00:06:49.957 --> 00:06:53.767
They haven't paid their hospital fees,
and their parents are nowhere in sight.

68
00:06:53.767 --> 00:06:56.142
They just sent the kids here,
and they're being so stubborn.

69
00:06:56.142 --> 00:06:59.224
Doctor, please save my little sister.

70
00:06:59.224 --> 00:07:01.652
- Okay, let's go inside.
- You can't.

71
00:07:01.652 --> 00:07:04.250
- Get out of the way.
- I told you, they haven't paid yet!

72
00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:07.647
Is that important
when a child is in this state?

73
00:07:07.647 --> 00:07:09.231
Let's go.

74
00:07:22.628 --> 00:07:27.162
Please inject her
with a dose of metronidazole.

75
00:07:46.075 --> 00:07:49.919
Since she's underweight
for her age, inject the fluids slowly.

76
00:07:49.919 --> 00:07:51.277
Okay.

77
00:08:16.049 --> 00:08:18.539
What are you doing
out in the cold? Let's go inside.

78
00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.869
You're hurt too.

79
00:08:26.989 --> 00:08:29.263
I said, let's go inside.

80
00:08:30.409 --> 00:08:32.967
I'll have to pay hospital fees then.

81
00:08:46.052 --> 00:08:49.011
That's not something
for you to worry about

82
00:08:49.011 --> 00:08:51.327
because the adults
will worry about that for you.

83
00:08:55.822 --> 00:08:59.486
Wow, you're hurt pretty badly.

84
00:09:00.395 --> 00:09:03.001
Didn't it hurt? It looks
like it would have hurt.

85
00:09:08.975 --> 00:09:12.237
If it hurt, you should've told us
instead of holding it in.

86
00:09:27.559 --> 00:09:29.134
Doctor.

87
00:09:29.689 --> 00:09:33.802
- Yeah?
- How can I become a doctor?

88
00:09:35.621 --> 00:09:38.293
I want to be a doctor, just like you.

89
00:09:38.293 --> 00:09:41.982
A kind doctor, who helps
the unfortunate, like us.

90
00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.481
I'm not a kind doctor though.

91
00:09:47.039 --> 00:09:51.135
But I have a feeling that
you'll become a kind doctor.

92
00:09:51.135 --> 00:09:56.260
You worried about your little sister
before worrying about yourself.

93
00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.227
You're more than qualified.

94
00:10:04.433 --> 00:10:07.179
If you're not a kind doctor...

95
00:10:07.179 --> 00:10:09.761
<i>then who is?</i>

96
00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:19.045
What are you doing? We're here.

97
00:10:19.045 --> 00:10:21.939
- Okay.
- You've been acting weird today.

98
00:10:21.939 --> 00:10:24.837
Oh, really? I see
everyone got off already.

99
00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:37.832
Thank you, Doctor. Thank you so much.

100
00:10:37.832 --> 00:10:39.514
You've been waiting a long time.

101
00:10:39.514 --> 00:10:43.381
I'll do my best to perform
the surgery successfully.

102
00:10:43.381 --> 00:10:46.159
Yes, I'll leave it to you, Doctor.

103
00:10:46.159 --> 00:10:49.371
Please take care of him.

104
00:10:53.914 --> 00:10:55.568
Pass! Pass!

105
00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:02.818
Are you saying that
Lee Gil Sang is still alive?

106
00:11:02.818 --> 00:11:06.997
Geez, you've gotten
a lot weaker, haven't you?

107
00:11:09.169 --> 00:11:12.649
You should have killed him.
Why only leave him in a coma?

108
00:11:14.711 --> 00:11:17.510
- Where is he?
- Sunrim Hospital.

109
00:11:18.697 --> 00:11:22.928
I stabbed him like crazy
to kill him, but they saved him?

110
00:11:24.769 --> 00:11:28.395
- What a guy.
- Who are you talking about?

111

What?

112
00:11:33.395 --> 00:11:36.943
There's an interesting
new doctor in the infirmary.

113
00:11:43.487 --> 00:11:46.323
- His name is Kang In Kyu.
- Kang In Kyu?

114
00:11:46.323 --> 00:11:49.697
Look into it. Find out
what he did before this

115
00:11:49.697 --> 00:11:52.227
and why he crawled in here.

116
00:11:52.227 --> 00:11:55.380
If I'm lucky, I'll be able
to use him to my advantage.

117
00:11:56.885 --> 00:11:58.429

I need your approval.

Why are you buying so many medications?

125
00:12:40.611 --> 00:12:44.659
- We just performed a big surgery.
- Bring me the medical log.

126
00:12:44.659 --> 00:12:46.862
Nurse Ahn, the medical log!

Okay.

How is he? Will he be
able to undergo surgery?

141

Yes, he's in a good enough
condition to undergo surgery.

Did you find a donor?

143

Congressman Noh's cousin
agreed to make the donation.

144
00:14:35.418 --> 00:14:37.332
What about the kidney?

145

has a brain-dead patient?

What do you think?

150
00:14:57.135 --> 00:15:01.660
A simultaneous transplant
on a congressman.

151
00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:04.514

00:16:06.086 --> 00:16:08.725
Doctor, a patient is here to see you.

162
00:16:08.725 --> 00:16:10.683
4713.

163
00:16:32.851 --> 00:16:36.395
You don't seem to be
in a good mood today.

164
00:16:37.932 --> 00:16:39.771
Does it seem that way?

165
00:16:42.731 --> 00:16:45.929
Geez, aren't you happy to see me?

166
00:16:45.929 --> 00:16:47.910
I'm happy to see you though.

167
00:16:52.129 --> 00:16:55.166
Thankfully, the wound isn't infected.

168
00:16:55.166 --> 00:16:57.169
I was worried.

169
00:17:00.647 --> 00:17:04.823
I heard that you saved
that bastard, Lee Gil Sang.

170
00:17:05.765 --> 00:17:09.869
- Yes.
- You're skilled.

171
00:17:09.869 --> 00:17:11.944
It couldn't have been easy.

172
00:17:11.944 --> 00:17:14.496
Why would it be?

173
00:17:14.496 --> 00:17:16.879
You gave your all, stabbing him.

174
00:17:16.879 --> 00:17:20.496
I did, at the time.
I was trying to kill him, you see.

175
00:17:20.496 --> 00:17:24.036
But you saved his life.

176
00:17:26.496 --> 00:17:28.688
You saved me too.

177
00:17:28.688 --> 00:17:32.977
I already have a life sentence,
so if he had died, it would get doubled.

178
00:17:32.977 --> 00:17:37.842
Wow, if it hadn't been for you,
I would've lost all hope of getting out.

179
00:17:42.573 --> 00:17:44.168
That's a relief.

180
00:17:48.101 --> 00:17:49.916
But...

181
00:17:49.916 --> 00:17:51.825
I guess you can tell, just from the wound

182
00:17:51.825 --> 00:17:55.258
whether it was a professional
or an amateur who did the stabbing.

183
00:17:56.599 --> 00:18:00.132
I could've seen the cut
to the liver as a coincidence

184
00:18:00.132 --> 00:18:02.621
but the precise stabbing
of the main artery

185
00:18:02.621 --> 00:18:05.534
suggests that you have medical knowledge.

186
00:18:16.123 --> 00:18:19.334
- You said you saw me on the news.
- Yes.

187
00:18:19.334 --> 00:18:22.863
Then you must know
about the crimes I committed.

188
00:18:22.863 --> 00:18:26.581
I don't remember the exact details.

189
00:18:32.345 --> 00:18:34.242
I was in the log business.

190
00:18:35.677 --> 00:18:39.497
The log business where you take
logs and plant them somewhere else.

191
00:18:41.967 --> 00:18:45.117
I'm talking about
organ trade, you stuffy punk.

192
00:18:49.621 --> 00:18:51.992
Is that what you call it?

193
00:18:54.373 --> 00:18:56.114
That's right.

194
00:18:56.114 --> 00:18:58.851
I've been in that business for years.

195
00:18:59.613 --> 00:19:01.819
I know, even if I don't look at it.

196
00:19:01.819 --> 00:19:04.503
I know where each organ is.

197
00:19:11.709 --> 00:19:15.361
- Who did the surgery?
- What?

198
00:19:16.861 --> 00:19:21.371
The extraction? That was
someone else, named Yeon Jang.

199
00:19:21.371 --> 00:19:22.973
He's...

200
00:19:27.658 --> 00:19:31.187
The truth is, the bastard I stabbed...

201
00:19:32.033 --> 00:19:34.213
was that Yeon Jang.

202
00:19:41.898 --> 00:19:45.082
Why are you so surprised?

203
00:19:46.255 --> 00:19:49.384
- I'm not.
- But the thing is

204
00:19:49.384 --> 00:19:52.640
from time to time,
mistakes are made in the extraction

205
00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:55.994
which is a shame, because that's the
most important part of our business.

No, I don't know much about him.

we shouldn't be contemplating between
the congressman and a criminal.

320
00:32:36.747 --> 00:32:38.547
Then, are you saying that giving it

321
00:32:38.547 --> 00:32:41.085
to the congressman
was the right thing to do?

322
00:32:41.085 --> 00:32:43.859
Well, that's not
exactly what I'm saying...

323
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:48.084
We're doctors.

324
00:32:48.084 --> 00:32:53.282
I believe that we must treat our patients
equally, no matter what anyone says.

325
00:32:56.628 --> 00:32:59.006
Without regards to their status.

326
00:33:30.425 --> 00:33:32.355
The blood vessel anatomy looks good.

327
00:33:47.757 --> 00:33:51.617
Is it that hard to turn
a blind eye, just this once?

328
00:33:51.617 --> 00:33:53.289
A patient's life is on the line.

329
00:33:53.289 --> 00:33:55.891
Do you think you're the only one
who cares about patient's lives?

330
00:33:55.891 --> 00:34:00.686
But he didn't violate the rules. Taking
disciplinary action for following it...

331
00:34:00.686 --> 00:34:02.976
is unjust.

332
00:34:02.976 --> 00:34:05.164
I agree.

333
00:34:05.164 --> 00:34:07.762
Really? Fine.

334
00:34:07.762 --> 00:34:10.965
Then, let's take a vote.

335
00:34:15.210 --> 00:34:17.724
And see what result we get.

336
00:34:39.936 --> 00:34:42.047
It's because of Kim Hyung Bum, isn't it?

337
00:34:42.047 --> 00:34:44.954
The reason you came here.

338
00:34:47.489 --> 00:34:50.182
A son who became a doctor at a prison

339
00:34:50.182 --> 00:34:53.447
to get revenge for his father?

340
00:34:53.447 --> 00:34:55.509
Wow.

341
00:34:55.509 --> 00:35:00.059
Wow, this is enough
to make international headlines.

342
00:35:05.050 --> 00:35:07.547
Did you do a background check on me?

343
00:35:12.451 --> 00:35:16.603
If you administer this much medicine,
he'll die in less than a week.

344
00:35:16.603 --> 00:35:19.023
I knew you were fishy...

345
00:35:19.023 --> 00:35:22.547
I won't let this happen,
as long as I'm in charge.

346
00:35:23.331 --> 00:35:25.856
What is it that you want?

347
00:35:30.637 --> 00:35:35.251
Get out... before you create chaos.

348
00:35:49.289 --> 00:35:50.822
Suture.

349
00:36:16.166 --> 00:36:19.840
You should hurry. His BP is dropping.

350
00:36:42.012 --> 00:36:44.402
Why? Is there a problem?

351
00:36:45.536 --> 00:36:48.942
- Should I call the center chief?
- No.

352
00:36:48.942 --> 00:36:50.605
I'm fine.

353
00:37:05.521 --> 00:37:07.137
What's wrong with him?

354
00:37:13.806 --> 00:37:15.599
Lower it.

355
00:37:17.481 --> 00:37:18.963
More.

356
00:37:34.514 --> 00:37:38.059
- Geez, what is this?
- There's blood everywhere!

357
00:37:38.059 --> 00:37:41.331
- Wait, what's going on?
- Call them!

358
00:37:43.025 --> 00:37:45.032
Doctor, what do we do about this blood?

359
00:37:45.032 --> 00:37:48.300
Block it! Gauze! Gauze!

360
00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:52.097
- Doctor, what do we do about the blood?
- Gauze! Gauze!

361
00:37:52.637 --> 00:37:54.420
Suction! Suction!

362
00:37:55.452 --> 00:37:57.449
What are you doing?

363
00:37:59.451 --> 00:38:02.905
Gauze! Gauze! Give me more gauze!

364
00:38:03.813 --> 00:38:06.280
What are they doing down there?

365
00:38:09.547 --> 00:38:11.163
What's wrong, Doctor Lee?

366
00:38:12.155 --> 00:38:16.916
Huh? Huh? Hey! Hey, hey!
Call the center chief! Hurry! Hurry!

367
00:38:16.916 --> 00:38:18.867
- Get a hold of yourself!
- He's not answering...

368
00:38:18.867 --> 00:38:21.128
Hurry! Go and find him immediately!

369
00:38:21.128 --> 00:38:23.052
- Hey, what are you doing? Find him!
- Yes, Sir!

370
00:38:23.052 --> 00:38:26.027
Run over there! Run!

371
00:38:34.976 --> 00:38:38.460
I will announce the voting results
of the disciplinary committee meeting

372
00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:41.012
regarding Center Chief Go.

373
00:38:49.565 --> 00:38:52.688
- What about you, Chief Baek?
- What about me?

374
00:38:52.688 --> 00:38:55.659
You should leave with me then.

375
00:38:55.659 --> 00:39:00.152
I applied for this position
with the same reason as yours.

376
00:39:04.914 --> 00:39:07.961
I simply want to take care
of the patients...

377
00:39:07.961 --> 00:39:12.527
I applied for this position
for the exact same reason.

378
00:39:13.193 --> 00:39:17.480
I didn't come here to kill Kim Hyung Bum.

379
00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:21.670
I came here to save a life,
just like you did.

380
00:39:25.177 --> 00:39:27.213
What are you talking about?

381
00:39:28.826 --> 00:39:30.833
4817.

382
00:39:40.954 --> 00:39:44.800
His name is Baek Sung Ho.
Your one and only son

383
00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:48.440
<i>lives with high blood pressure
and high cholesterol</i>

384
00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:50.289
<i>so I'm sure you were worried.</i>

385
00:39:54.829 --> 00:39:57.193
You pay six 10-minute visits a week

386
00:39:57.193 --> 00:40:00.228
to your son, under the guise
of giving him treatment.

387
00:40:00.228 --> 00:40:01.632
Geez.

388
00:40:04.989 --> 00:40:10.134
Do you think you'd be able
to stay here if the truth got out?

389
00:40:10.976 --> 00:40:13.440
I guess you're acting like this
because you're afraid

390
00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:17.132
you won't be able to take care
of your son if I cause trouble.

391
00:40:17.132 --> 00:40:19.070
But don't worry.

392
00:40:20.168 --> 00:40:22.688
I'll say it again

393
00:40:22.688 --> 00:40:25.344
but I'm not here to kill Kim Hyung Bum.

394
00:40:25.344 --> 00:40:27.364
I came here to save him

395
00:40:27.364 --> 00:40:30.184
so that he can live
in misery for a long time.

396
00:40:33.965 --> 00:40:36.442
May I go now?

397
00:40:49.543 --> 00:40:53.201
13 are in favor, 13 are opposed,
and 2 abstained from voting.

398
00:40:53.201 --> 00:40:56.797
As such, I will go forward
with special enforcements.

399
00:40:56.797 --> 00:40:58.766
Do it quickly.

400
00:41:02.228 --> 00:41:03.791
Center Chief!

401
00:41:04.521 --> 00:41:07.773
- What is it? You didn't even knock!
- We're in trouble!

402
00:41:07.773 --> 00:41:10.480
Congressman Noh is about
to go into cardiac arrest!

403
00:41:11.903 --> 00:41:15.235
- What?
- Center Chief, you must come quickly!

404
00:41:19.045 --> 00:41:22.503
What are you doing? Get over there.

405
00:41:30.199 --> 00:41:31.811
150 Joules!

406
00:41:31.811 --> 00:41:34.737
150 Joules! Charged!

407
00:41:36.014 --> 00:41:39.181
One, two, three! Clear!

408
00:41:39.181 --> 00:41:40.597
Shoot!

409
00:41:48.934 --> 00:41:50.742
200 Joules!

410
00:41:50.742 --> 00:41:53.938
200 Joules! Charged!

411
00:41:53.938 --> 00:41:56.501
One, two, three! Clear!

412
00:41:56.501 --> 00:41:57.702
Shoot!

413
00:42:06.222 --> 00:42:09.934
- What's going on here?
- Did his heart stop?

414
00:42:11.097 --> 00:42:13.119
Give me the scalpel.

415
00:42:14.177 --> 00:42:15.768
Pardon?

416
00:42:17.409 --> 00:42:20.391
What are you doing? Give me the scalpel.

417
00:42:23.197 --> 00:42:25.525
I told you to give me the scalpel!

418
00:42:35.994 --> 00:42:38.521
Are you planning on sacrificing
perfectly healthy people?

419
00:43:08.157 --> 00:43:09.344
Forceps.

420
00:43:30.284 --> 00:43:31.693
Suture.

421
00:43:46.043 --> 00:43:47.351
Scissors.

422
00:44:04.286 --> 00:44:08.315
- He's back!
- He's been saved!

423
00:44:08.315 --> 00:44:10.724
What did he do?

424
00:44:10.724 --> 00:44:12.322
Wow!

425
00:44:30.806 --> 00:44:33.021
Don't worry about his vitals.

426
00:44:35.641 --> 00:44:38.137
<i>The collateral vessel was left out.</i>

427
00:44:38.137 --> 00:44:40.010
<i>Why did he make such a mistake?</i>

428
00:45:03.987 --> 00:45:05.554
Scissors.

429
00:45:19.092 --> 00:45:21.016
Check the doppler
once the surgery is finished

430
00:45:21.016 --> 00:45:23.851
and re-register him for a liver
transplant as an emergency patient.

431
00:45:23.851 --> 00:45:25.822
He won't last more than
a few days in this state.

432
00:45:25.822 --> 00:45:27.882
- Yes, Sir.
- Yes, Sir.

433
00:45:27.882 --> 00:45:29.793
Control the bleeding and close him up.

434
00:45:29.793 --> 00:45:31.280
Let's give it some time.

435
00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:34.713
- I got it, Sir.
- Okay.

436
00:45:37.429 --> 00:45:38.989
Let's talk.

437
00:45:52.204 --> 00:45:55.505
Are you sad that your friend is gone?

438
00:45:56.088 --> 00:45:59.898
I'm not sad. I'm jealous.

439
00:45:59.898 --> 00:46:02.472
He doesn't have to be locked up anymore.

440
00:46:02.472 --> 00:46:05.454
If it's too stuffy, would you like me
to take you out for some fresh air?

441
00:46:05.454 --> 00:46:07.820
That's okay. You're busy.

442
00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:10.291
I'd still be stuck
inside the prison anyway.

443
00:46:11.181 --> 00:46:15.277
Don't feel too sad.
I'm sure he went to a good place.

444
00:46:15.277 --> 00:46:17.847
Did you say that he donated his organs?

445
00:46:17.847 --> 00:46:20.036
Yes.

446
00:46:20.036 --> 00:46:22.416
Do you think I could do that too?

447
00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:29.661
Yes.

448
00:46:29.661 --> 00:46:34.137
It isn't our specialty,
so we could only explain so much.

449
00:46:34.137 --> 00:46:37.405
Organ donation isn't an
easy decision to make either.

450
00:46:37.405 --> 00:46:40.940
Not at all. I should
head over there, of course.

451
00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:43.039
I'll head over soon.

452
00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:18.887
It was caused by the fact
that you started the anastomosis

453
00:47:18.887 --> 00:47:20.997
before blocking the collateral vessel.

454
00:47:20.997 --> 00:47:22.378
But...

455
00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:25.811
the condition of the blood vessels...

456
00:47:25.811 --> 00:47:28.805
If you bite off more than you can chew,
an accident is bound to happen.

457
00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:31.354
You almost killed two people today.

458
00:47:31.354 --> 00:47:33.572
Both the donor and the recipient.

459
00:47:41.003 --> 00:47:43.592
If you ever feel unconfident
about a surgery, let me know

460
00:47:43.592 --> 00:47:46.175
instead of experimenting
with patients' lives.

461
00:47:46.175 --> 00:47:48.175
I'll keep that in mind.

462
00:48:03.753 --> 00:48:06.352
Where's the doctor?
Isn't the doctor coming out?

463
00:48:06.352 --> 00:48:08.506
Sir, please talk to me.

464
00:48:08.506 --> 00:48:12.293
Not you! Tell the
doctor in charge to come out!

465
00:48:13.177 --> 00:48:16.871
- If you don't stop, I'll report you.
- Okay, go ahead!

466
00:48:16.871 --> 00:48:19.483
Go ahead!

467
00:48:20.450 --> 00:48:22.758
What are you glaring at?

468
00:48:28.548 --> 00:48:30.276
Darn it.

469
00:48:31.282 --> 00:48:32.302
Hello, is this security?

470
00:48:32.302 --> 00:48:34.602
Are you crazy?

471
00:48:42.689 --> 00:48:44.430
Joo Hyuk.

472
00:48:44.430 --> 00:48:46.635
Joo Hyuk, are you okay?

473
00:48:48.856 --> 00:48:53.039
What do we do? Oh my,
what if your tendons are torn?

474
00:48:53.039 --> 00:48:54.525
What do we do?

475
00:49:05.092 --> 00:49:06.825
<i>[Organ Donation Registration Information]</i>

476
00:49:06.825 --> 00:49:08.631
Please read this part.

477
00:49:10.628 --> 00:49:14.102
- So Grandpa...
- Baek Gyu Sang.

478
00:49:14.102 --> 00:49:16.854
Oh, yes, I mean...

479
00:49:16.854 --> 00:49:19.901
Baek Gyu Sang, if you look here

480
00:49:19.901 --> 00:49:24.392
you will be a brain death donor.
And as a brain death donor

481
00:49:24.392 --> 00:49:28.401
you consent to donating your organs
if your brain stops functioning

482
00:49:28.401 --> 00:49:31.150
and can't be recovered.

483
00:49:31.150 --> 00:49:33.831
If the brain is dead,
your heart will stop

484
00:49:33.831 --> 00:49:37.577
within a maximum of two weeks,
no matter what treatments you receive.

485
00:49:38.191 --> 00:49:40.747
So if my heart stops first...

486
00:49:40.747 --> 00:49:42.738
then I won't be able to donate my organs.

487
00:49:42.738 --> 00:49:46.293
Whoa, that's right.
Grandpa, you're so smart...

488
00:49:47.092 --> 00:49:50.044
You're very impressive.

489
00:49:52.691 --> 00:49:56.872
But you'll still be able
to donate your cornea.

490
00:49:56.872 --> 00:50:02.072
I guess someone else will see
the world through my eyes then.

491
00:50:04.119 --> 00:50:05.534
Yes.

492
00:50:07.334 --> 00:50:09.244
I'm serving a life sentence

493
00:50:09.244 --> 00:50:13.240
so I didn't think I'd ever see
the outside world again.

494
00:50:14.631 --> 00:50:18.593
I'd like that. I can
see the outside world again.

495
00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:22.842
Even if I'll be seeing it
in someone else's body.

496
00:50:22.842 --> 00:50:25.381
Do you feel that suffocated?

497
00:50:26.273 --> 00:50:27.919
Of course.

498
00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:34.021
You're doing a good deed.

499
00:50:35.465 --> 00:50:37.836
Do I need to sign here?

500
00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:40.157
Yes.

501
00:50:44.133 --> 00:50:47.778
If you ever change
your mind, let me know.

502
00:50:47.778 --> 00:50:49.892
It can always be withdrawn.

503
00:50:52.206 --> 00:50:54.617
Did you consult your family about this?

504
00:51:06.267 --> 00:51:10.293
Organ extraction leaves a big scar.

505
00:51:10.293 --> 00:51:13.178
It may be easy for you
to sign those forms

506
00:51:13.178 --> 00:51:16.586
but it could really hurt
your surviving family members.

507
00:51:20.890 --> 00:51:23.086
It can be withdrawn
with your family's opposition

508
00:51:23.086 --> 00:51:24.861
even if you already gave your consent.

509
00:51:29.445 --> 00:51:32.742
Either way, my body
will rot or burn after I die

510
00:51:32.742 --> 00:51:35.890
so who cares if it leaves a scar?

511
00:51:37.756 --> 00:51:40.601
But you must still consider...

512
00:51:41.242 --> 00:51:43.592
how your surviving
family members would feel.

513
00:51:53.881 --> 00:51:56.814
Doctor, why are you being like this?

514
00:52:09.227 --> 00:52:11.534
This is my daughter.

515
00:52:12.702 --> 00:52:16.280
And this child is my granddaughter.

516
00:52:18.012 --> 00:52:20.287
Wow, she's so cute.

517
00:52:20.287 --> 00:52:22.265
Her mother is beautiful too.

518
00:52:22.265 --> 00:52:26.227
She conceived her
second child not too long ago.

519
00:52:27.421 --> 00:52:30.383
Doctor, come take a look.

520
00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:35.731
Take a look. I looked at it so much,
I feel like they're my family.

521
00:52:35.731 --> 00:52:37.736
Go on.

522
00:52:46.532 --> 00:52:48.816
Isn't there a saying?

523
00:52:50.590 --> 00:52:53.115
They say that if
a parent commits a sin...

524
00:52:53.115 --> 00:52:55.307
then the children will
inherit the consequences.

525
00:52:57.217 --> 00:53:02.226
I should do something good
before I go, don't you think?

526
00:53:03.352 --> 00:53:05.445
That's the only way...

527
00:53:06.387 --> 00:53:08.702
that these kids won't pay for my sins.

528
00:53:13.602 --> 00:53:17.530
And even if it's through another body...

529
00:53:18.206 --> 00:53:21.068
I'll probably run
into them at least once...

530
00:53:21.762 --> 00:53:23.992
even if it's just by chance.

531
00:53:29.110 --> 00:53:32.392
That's why I decided to be a donor.

532
00:53:34.939 --> 00:53:39.428
I want to see her,
at least once in my life.

533
00:53:42.767 --> 00:53:44.680
Children...

534
00:53:45.615 --> 00:53:47.889
aren't allowed to come for visits.

535
00:53:52.642 --> 00:53:55.414
My daughter is coming to see me today.

536
00:53:56.407 --> 00:54:00.805
When she gets here,
I'll explain it to her

537
00:54:00.805 --> 00:54:02.974
and tell her not to be too sad.

538
00:54:03.615 --> 00:54:06.852
So you don't have to worry
too much either.

539
00:54:32.847 --> 00:54:34.385
Excuse me!

540
00:54:37.092 --> 00:54:39.688
Why is your mindset so
screwed up, when you're so young?

541
00:54:39.688 --> 00:54:41.718
What's wrong with my mindset?

542
00:54:42.392 --> 00:54:45.128
- Aren't you a doctor?
- I am.

543
00:54:45.128 --> 00:54:47.461
If you're a doctor but you're
not going to recommend it

544
00:54:47.461 --> 00:54:49.077
at least don't get in the way!

545
00:54:49.077 --> 00:54:53.101
I simply gave him an explanation.
I didn't get in the way.

546
00:54:54.409 --> 00:54:57.111
"The impact it will have on his family?"

547
00:54:57.611 --> 00:55:00.994
- The pain.
- Wow.

548
00:55:01.584 --> 00:55:05.923
Okay, it's true that the organ
donors' families get hurt.

549
00:55:05.923 --> 00:55:09.188
But they also live on
with more pride as a result.

550
00:55:09.188 --> 00:55:11.874
And even if the
organ donor consents to it

551
00:55:11.874 --> 00:55:15.637
it can be withdrawn
if the family opposes.

552
00:55:15.637 --> 00:55:19.155
There are some circumstances
where that's not possible.

553
00:55:19.155 --> 00:55:21.724
Wait, what kind of
circumstances are those?

554
00:55:21.724 --> 00:55:25.586
Gosh, you talk like you're
the organ donor's family.

555
00:55:28.307 --> 00:55:31.111
My one and only little sister...

556
00:55:31.111 --> 00:55:33.611
donated her organs
as a brain-dead patient before she left.

557
00:55:39.593 --> 00:55:44.064
Without my consent, and just
the consent of my foster father.

558
00:56:19.108 --> 00:56:22.646
Wow, what do I do?
Is it too late to apologize?

559
00:56:27.291 --> 00:56:30.664
No, it's not like
I'll ever see him again.

560
00:56:30.664 --> 00:56:32.363
I'm just overreacting.

561
00:56:52.332 --> 00:56:54.947
- Get in.
- I'm fine.

562
00:56:54.947 --> 00:56:57.865
Please just get in.
I'll drop you off on my way home.

563
00:56:57.865 --> 00:57:00.130
I'm really okay.

564
00:57:00.130 --> 00:57:02.403
I'm really sorry
about what I said earlier.

565
00:57:03.063 --> 00:57:06.803
So hurry and get in. The car
behind us is waiting. Hurry.

566
00:57:30.611 --> 00:57:32.135
Are you sleeping?

567
00:57:33.113 --> 00:57:34.851
No, I'm not.

568
00:57:35.515 --> 00:57:39.303
- Are you mad then?
- I'm not mad.

569
00:57:40.255 --> 00:57:43.084
Hey, I think you are.

570
00:57:44.671 --> 00:57:49.546
I'm just closing my eyes
because I get carsick. I'm not mad.

571
00:57:51.756 --> 00:57:54.264
Car sickness? Yeah, right.

572
00:57:56.657 --> 00:58:00.374
But how do you know the center chief?

573
00:58:00.374 --> 00:58:02.823
We just happen to know each other.

574
00:58:02.823 --> 00:58:04.586
In what way?

575
00:58:06.468 --> 00:58:11.842
We just ran into each other in the past,
since we live in such a small world.

576
00:58:19.662 --> 00:58:23.325
<i>[Baby on Board]

581
00:58:47.186 --> 00:58:48.686
Geez, seriously.

582
00:58:48.686 --> 00:58:50.736
Let him go ahead. He must be in a rush.

583
00:58:50.736 --> 00:58:52.407
Geez.

584
00:58:55.744 --> 00:58:58.834
Hey! Drive properly!
You should've pulled over faster!

585
00:58:58.834 --> 00:59:01.195
- What's wrong with him?
- What is he saying?

586
00:59:01.195 --> 00:59:03.093
What's wrong with that guy?

587
00:59:08.206 --> 00:59:09.894
Geez.

588
00:59:17.265 --> 00:59:19.813
Geez, seriously.
You put on your seatbelt, right?

589
00:59:19.813 --> 00:59:21.461
- I did.
- What about Byul?

590
00:59:21.461 --> 00:59:24.486
I took it off for her since she felt
it was stuffy, but I'll put it back on.

591
00:59:24.486 --> 00:59:27.660
I'll put it back on. Byul, come here.

592
00:59:27.660 --> 00:59:29.604
- Geez!
- Gosh!

593
00:59:34.229 --> 00:59:36.682
Honey, are you okay?

594
00:59:36.682 --> 00:59:39.035
I was just startled.

595
00:59:39.035 --> 00:59:41.329
No, check one more time.
Are you really okay?

596
00:59:41.329 --> 00:59:43.803
I'm fine. I'm fine. Let's go slowly.

597
00:59:43.803 --> 00:59:47.535

There's blood. You're bleeding.

Is this 911? There's been
a car crash, but...
