1
00:00:05.694 --> 00:00:08.964
We got General Manger Kwak to stamp his fingerprint on his statement.

2
00:00:09.095 --> 00:00:10.634
This is an investigation report of the crime scene.

3
00:00:10.634 --> 00:00:11.594
(Episode 38)

4
00:00:14.265 --> 00:00:15.265
Good job.

5
00:00:15.804 --> 00:00:18.275
Are you really going to aim for Lee Kwang Ho?

6
00:00:18.275 --> 00:00:20.504
Of course. He instigated murder.

7
00:00:20.944 --> 00:00:22.304
Let's request an arrest warrant.

8
00:00:22.304 --> 00:00:24.975
What's the use? They never give it to us anyway.

9
00:00:25.944 --> 00:00:27.815
Then we'll just have to arrest him without a warrant.

10
00:00:27.984 --> 00:00:28.984
Really?

11
00:00:29.214 --> 00:00:31.254
Can we do that? He's our former president.

12
00:00:33.015 --> 00:00:34.825
What else can we do when they won't give us a warrant?

13
00:00:35.155 --> 00:00:36.755
He clearly committed a crime.

14
00:00:37.255 --> 00:00:40.395
The evidence and witness for what he did 10 years ago are all vague.

15
00:00:40.694 --> 00:00:42.164
But this time, he's definitely responsible for this.

16
00:00:42.965 --> 00:00:45.365
We have a valid statement, and the victim is hospitalized.

17
00:00:45.365 --> 00:00:46.395
You're right.

18
00:00:48.164 --> 00:00:51.905
But we still need to do everything we can in order to claim that...

19
00:00:52.075 --> 00:00:53.605
we followed all the necessary procedures.

20
00:00:53.975 --> 00:00:56.204
So let's wait another day for the arrest warrant.

21
00:00:59.515 --> 00:01:02.814
Prosecutor Kim, I'm Inspector Park.

22
00:01:04.314 --> 00:01:05.415
Good job.

23
00:01:07.355 --> 00:01:09.284
I want you to hand me the case.

24
00:01:10.155 --> 00:01:11.825
And I'll request an arrest warrant...

25
00:01:12.655 --> 00:01:15.364
for Lee Kwang Ho, so please give it some time.

26
00:01:16.325 --> 00:01:17.334
Okay.

27
00:01:22.504 --> 00:01:23.704
It was Inspector Park.

28
00:01:24.805 --> 00:01:27.105
He told me that he got General Manager Kwak's statement...

29
00:01:27.745 --> 00:01:29.344
and asked me to request an arrest warrant.

30
00:01:29.344 --> 00:01:30.344
So...

31
00:01:31.015 --> 00:01:32.745
do you think you'll be able to arrest him?

32
00:01:34.314 --> 00:01:37.954
At this rate, things might end up just going in circles.

33
00:01:38.655 --> 00:01:41.424
People mistakenly think that prosecutors are the ones...

34
00:01:41.984 --> 00:01:45.424
who protect the people who are rich and powerful.

35
00:01:46.555 --> 00:01:49.295
But in reality, judges are actually the ones who do that.

36
00:01:50.364 --> 00:01:54.305
Regardless of how hard we try to...

37
00:01:54.305 --> 00:01:56.974
get an arrest warrant...

38
00:01:56.974 --> 00:01:58.905
and send someone to prison,

39
00:01:59.075 --> 00:02:02.674
all that can go to waste if the judge decides to overrule that.

40
00:02:03.515 --> 00:02:05.174
But prosecutors are always the ones to take the blame.

41
00:02:05.314 --> 00:02:06.344
So I'm asking you.

42
00:02:06.984 --> 00:02:09.584
Do you think you'll be able to arrest Lee Kwang Ho?

43
00:02:10.714 --> 00:02:13.855
That depends on Chairwoman Gook.

44
00:02:14.825 --> 00:02:17.125
If she lays down the bricks for us,

45
00:02:17.494 --> 00:02:20.225
the court will have no choice but to issue a warrant.

46
00:02:20.625 --> 00:02:24.635
But if she changes her mind and goes back on her word tomorrow...

47
00:02:24.635 --> 00:02:25.795
That's not going to happen.

48
00:02:27.304 --> 00:02:28.765
So I'll see you tomorrow.

49
00:02:33.135 --> 00:02:34.804
I'm so looking forward to this.

50
00:02:35.804 --> 00:02:37.714
I can't believe we're finally having a press conference.

51
00:02:39.875 --> 00:02:41.815
You worked with Lee Kwang Ho for 20 years,

52
00:02:41.815 --> 00:02:44.154
and you were the chief director of the NIS.

53
00:02:44.154 --> 00:02:46.924
So every word you spit out will have such a great impact.

54
00:02:47.385 --> 00:02:48.484
Plus, people will start talking about...

55
00:02:48.484 --> 00:02:51.125
all his other crimes that are either statute-barred or lack evidence.

56
00:02:52.394 --> 00:02:55.994
There will be too much information for the reporters to write down.

57
00:02:57.565 --> 00:02:59.635
You're going to become a celebrity after this.

58
00:03:01.635 --> 00:03:03.605
You're the one who'll become the celebrity.

59
00:03:04.834 --> 00:03:06.475
I'll end up in handcuffs right after the press conference.

60
00:03:08.204 --> 00:03:09.975
I won't cuff your hands too tightly.

61
00:03:10.774 --> 00:03:12.244
I'll keep anyone from seeing.

62
00:03:15.484 --> 00:03:19.154
The press conference is at 10am tomorrow morning.

63
00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:23.524
So you should be here by 9am.

64
00:03:23.725 --> 00:03:27.464
You should make sure Lee Kwang Ho doesn't find out about this.

65
00:03:27.595 --> 00:03:29.565
Of course. I got it.

66
00:03:33.334 --> 00:03:35.234
You'll finally be able to sleep at ease.

67
00:03:54.285 --> 00:03:55.725
Help me find my necklace before you go.

68
00:03:56.454 --> 00:03:58.695
I lost it when I fell down earlier.

69
00:03:59.095 --> 00:04:00.924
It's a gift I got from my dad.

70
00:04:36.625 --> 00:04:37.735
What are you doing?

71
00:04:37.995 --> 00:04:38.995
Hey.

72
00:04:39.635 --> 00:04:41.305
I was just about to go inside.

73
00:04:46.945 --> 00:04:50.745
I came out because I heard your voice. I'm going to go now.

74
00:04:50.745 --> 00:04:51.774
No, wait.

75
00:04:52.675 --> 00:04:55.385
Let's go together a little later.

76
00:04:55.385 --> 00:04:57.615
Kang told me that he's still awake and waiting for me.

77
00:04:57.615 --> 00:04:58.615
You can take your time.

78
00:04:58.615 --> 00:05:01.024
I'll stay here for the night.

79
00:05:01.255 --> 00:05:02.784
You both can go home.

80
00:05:03.284 --> 00:05:04.954
Really?

81
00:05:05.524 --> 00:05:07.724
- Then please do us a favor. - Okay.

82
00:05:07.995 --> 00:05:09.094
Bye.

83
00:05:47.404 --> 00:05:48.464
Chul Gi.

84
00:05:52.005 --> 00:05:53.544
I'm going to catch Lee Kwang Ho.

85
00:05:57.714 --> 00:05:58.745
I hope...

86
00:06:01.815 --> 00:06:03.954
you wake up to witness that.

87
00:07:28.104 --> 00:07:29.635
Thank you for letting me stay.

88
00:07:38.675 --> 00:07:39.714
Yes?

89
00:07:40.745 --> 00:07:41.985
Hello.

90
00:07:42.185 --> 00:07:44.154
What? You're home.

91
00:07:48.555 --> 00:07:50.995
Jin Young isn't picking up her phone.

92
00:07:52.055 --> 00:07:54.094
Her phone is still on, but she's not answering.

93
00:07:54.365 --> 00:07:56.024
Even when she stays at the office overnight,

94
00:07:56.024 --> 00:07:59.065
she always calls me in the morning, but she hasn't.

95
00:07:59.495 --> 00:08:01.604
By the way,

96
00:08:02.204 --> 00:08:03.534
didn't you come home with her yesterday?

97
00:08:04.404 --> 00:08:06.435
No. I came home by myself.

98
00:08:07.274 --> 00:08:08.344
But...

99
00:08:08.945 --> 00:08:10.315
how long has she been out of reach?

100
00:08:10.315 --> 00:08:11.575
Wait a second.

101
00:08:12.214 --> 00:08:14.214
I can't remember what time I called her last night.

102
00:08:15.084 --> 00:08:16.644
Are you sure you didn't come home with her?

103
00:08:17.485 --> 00:08:19.214
No. I'll quickly look into what happened.

104
00:08:19.214 --> 00:08:20.654
My gosh.

105
00:08:21.185 --> 00:08:23.325
Why do you guys have so much work?

106
00:08:24.724 --> 00:08:28.365
She wakes up on time regardless of how tired she may be.

107
00:08:29.894 --> 00:08:31.195
I wonder if she's exhausted.

108
00:08:31.565 --> 00:08:32.934
I really don't like this.

109
00:08:33.434 --> 00:08:35.664
Please look into what's going on.

110
00:08:35.865 --> 00:08:37.235
Okay. Don't worry.

111
00:08:51.914 --> 00:08:53.424
Hey, Jin Young. Where are you?

112
00:08:53.585 --> 00:08:55.985
Where do you think she is?

113
00:08:56.894 --> 00:08:59.995
Don't get too worked up. We're treating her well.

114
00:09:02.365 --> 00:09:04.635
But that's only going to last for another hour.

115
00:09:05.135 --> 00:09:06.664
I don't know what's going to happen to her after that.

116
00:09:07.335 --> 00:09:11.074
Call me as soon as you have Gook Su Ran's evidence.

117
00:09:11.674 --> 00:09:12.804
If she holds a press conference,

118
00:09:13.904 --> 00:09:17.044
I'm sure you know that you'll never get to see Lieutenant Jin again.

119
00:09:18.115 --> 00:09:20.385
Have everything ready for me within an hour.

120
00:09:21.184 --> 00:09:22.184
Okay?

121
00:09:23.814 --> 00:09:24.814
Hello?

122
00:09:37.064 --> 00:09:40.105
We'll start off with the bribe from NIS,

123
00:09:40.505 --> 00:09:43.034
then end with Odong Blowfish House.

124
00:09:43.804 --> 00:09:46.235
That way, they might overlook...

125
00:09:46.235 --> 00:09:47.574
at your charges.

126
00:09:53.784 --> 00:09:55.184
I knew you would come.

127
00:09:56.085 --> 00:09:59.314
It's better to see it in person, than to see it on the news.

128
00:10:06.495 --> 00:10:07.564
Chairwoman Gook.

129
00:10:08.324 --> 00:10:10.794
Keep your calm until the end.

130
00:10:11.194 --> 00:10:12.835
I'll come back to get you soon.

131
00:10:16.605 --> 00:10:17.835
We're almost there.

132
00:10:19.174 --> 00:10:21.274
Don't run away. I mean it.

133
00:10:23.414 --> 00:10:24.875
Can you look after her?

134
00:10:26.375 --> 00:10:27.444
Kim Jong Sam.

135
00:10:31.554 --> 00:10:33.284
Yes, I'm on my way.

136
00:10:34.154 --> 00:10:35.154
Yes.

137
00:10:41.794 --> 00:10:43.995
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

138
00:10:47.404 --> 00:10:49.034
I'll take the bullet,

139
00:10:50.005 --> 00:10:51.274
so you can step back.

140
00:11:05.684 --> 00:11:06.985
Where is Jin Jin Young?

141
00:11:09.154 --> 00:11:10.294
An Tae Jung.

142
00:11:10.894 --> 00:11:13.125
How can you abduct an officer because Lee Kwang Ho ordered you to?

143
00:11:13.924 --> 00:11:15.794
How can you call yourself a prosecutor and a lawyer?

144
00:11:16.564 --> 00:11:18.534
You're less than a human.

145
00:11:18.694 --> 00:11:21.235
Hey, calm down.

146
00:11:23.005 --> 00:11:24.534
I'm only loyal to myself.

147
00:11:25.904 --> 00:11:28.074
I abducted her because it would benefit me.

148
00:11:28.074 --> 00:11:29.174
Shut your mouth.

149
00:11:34.245 --> 00:11:35.745
Where is Jin Jin Young?

150
00:11:54.835 --> 00:11:57.904
You have to give it to me first before I tell you.

151
00:12:12.215 --> 00:12:13.424
Tell him the location...

152
00:12:14.355 --> 00:12:15.554
once I leave.

153
00:12:15.784 --> 00:12:17.924
(Public Prosecutors' Office)

154
00:12:17.924 --> 00:12:19.755
The number you're calling is currently not available.

155
00:12:36.105 --> 00:12:38.515
Gook Su Ran, Kim Jong Sam.

156
00:12:40.885 --> 00:12:44.385
It's my fault for trusting you.

157
00:12:55.564 --> 00:12:56.595
Jin Young!

158
00:12:57.694 --> 00:12:58.865
Jin Young!

159
00:13:03.735 --> 00:13:04.804
Jin Young.

160
00:13:08.044 --> 00:13:10.044
Jin Young! Jin Young.

161
00:13:48.245 --> 00:13:49.444
Where should I take you?

162
00:13:50.814 --> 00:13:53.015
- Anywhere. - Okay.

163
00:13:54.184 --> 00:13:56.385
Why did you cancel the press conference?

164
00:13:56.585 --> 00:13:59.194
Because I don't think I have to be involved.

165
00:14:00.225 --> 00:14:04.564
There is someone else who will break Lee Kwang Ho...

166
00:14:05.694 --> 00:14:06.865
better than me.

00:14:07.505 --> 00:14:08.564
I see.

168
00:14:09.635 --> 00:14:10.674
Then,

169
00:14:11.375 --> 00:14:14.544
what will happen to General Manager Kwak?

170
00:14:14.705 --> 00:14:17.544
I'll handle it. Just wait.

171
00:14:17.914 --> 00:14:19.015
I will.

172
00:14:21.144 --> 00:14:22.245
Also,

173
00:14:23.585 --> 00:14:25.814
if Kim Jong Sam comes to the office,

174
00:14:27.125 --> 00:14:29.485
just act oblivious and give him everything he wants.

175
00:14:29.684 --> 00:14:31.495
Act oblivious, and give him everything?

Yes.

177
00:14:33.965 --> 00:14:35.894
Okay. I understand.

178
00:14:45.635 --> 00:14:47.444
Yes, Mom. I'm fine.

179
00:14:47.804 --> 00:14:50.144
I'll come home after work.

180
00:14:50.745 --> 00:14:51.745
Okay.

181
00:14:54.085 --> 00:14:56.215
What did she say? Is she relieved?

182
00:14:56.814 --> 00:14:57.855
Yes.

183
00:14:58.654 --> 00:14:59.814
What about the press conference?

184
00:15:00.225 --> 00:15:02.855
Gook Su Ran was planning to reveal the evidence,

185
00:15:03.894 --> 00:15:05.194
but it's not going to happen anymore.

186

Am I the one who ruined it?

187
00:15:07.765 --> 00:15:09.225
I'm still an officer.

188
00:15:09.225 --> 00:15:11.265
They can't do anything to me.

189
00:15:11.265 --> 00:15:14.335
Hey, how can you say that after what happened?

190
00:15:14.664 --> 00:15:17.534
You know very well Lee Kwang Ho will kill.

191
00:15:18.135 --> 00:15:20.975
Gosh. I hate myself right now.

192
00:15:20.975 --> 00:15:23.044
I ruined such a crucial chance.

193
00:15:24.715 --> 00:15:26.115
We can still get him.

194
00:15:27.914 --> 00:15:29.885
I wouldn't have handed it over without thinking.

195
00:15:31.015 --> 00:15:33.955
I have a plan, so don't worry.

Do you mean it? Can I trust you?

Yes. Don't blame yourself.

I'm just glad you're okay.

334
00:28:53.425 --> 00:28:54.485
Why?

335
00:28:54.485 --> 00:28:57.755
He's from Gook Su Ran's team. Did she order him?

336
00:28:57.755 --> 00:29:00.124
No. This guy changed sides.

337
00:29:00.124 --> 00:29:02.364
It was him who abducted Kwak Young Jae and Ki Myun Joong.

338
00:29:02.665 --> 00:29:05.235
He does look like he's under Lee Kwang Ho.

339
00:29:05.235 --> 00:29:08.334
Keep on playing so we can check when Lee Kwang Ho was taken.

340
00:29:08.634 --> 00:29:09.665
Okay.

341
00:29:12.074 --> 00:29:13.175
Wait!

342
00:29:14.405 --> 00:29:16.005
That's...

343
00:29:16.374 --> 00:29:20.145
Wait. It was Officer Oh?

344
00:29:25.485 --> 00:29:27.084
I think he abducted...

345
00:29:28.324 --> 00:29:29.455
Lee Kwang Ho.

346
00:29:55.685 --> 00:29:58.155
(Doubtful Victory / Oh, the Mysterious)

347
00:29:58.784 --> 00:30:01.084
You don't think he really took him to kill him.

348
00:30:01.084 --> 00:30:02.925
Lee Kwang Ho killed Officer Oh's mom.

349
00:30:02.925 --> 00:30:05.094
I liked him a lot.

350
00:30:05.094 --> 00:30:06.594
Is it really a revenge then?

351
00:30:06.594 --> 00:30:08.465
- Officer Oh! - Officer Oh!

352
00:30:08.665 --> 00:30:10.534
Why did you kill my mom, Choi Yeon Mi?

353
00:30:10.534 --> 00:30:12.695
She should've listened when I told her not to have you!

354
00:30:12.695 --> 00:30:15.064
In the end, he is killed by his own son.

355
00:30:15.064 --> 00:30:16.665
What were you trying to save?

356
00:30:16.665 --> 00:30:19.074
I must have the country in my hands again,

357
00:30:19.074 --> 00:30:21.274
so this country could live!

358
00:30:21.274 --> 00:30:22.505
You're crazy.
