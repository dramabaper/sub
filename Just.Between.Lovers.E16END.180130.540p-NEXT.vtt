2
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.600
Hyung!

3
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.700
Hyung! You're awake. Are you alright?

4
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.600
Oh, I understand. I hear you.

5
00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.980
How did I get here?

6
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.100
I've heard that you collapsed in front of Moon Soo's house.

7
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.700
Imagine how shocked she was.

8
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.200
Moon Soo is here?

9
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.000
She's been sitting outside from last night without even eating anything.

10
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.400
I've asked her to eat, but she was just sitting there like a piece of rock.

11
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.200
Wait, lie down. I will bring her here.

12
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.600
Your sister's chief doctor instructed you to stay in your bed.

13
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.000
Hyung.

14
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.800
<i>Seeing you act like your life is over because of that type of thing</i>

15
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.600
<i> looks even worse.</i>

16
00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.910
<i>What are you doing here blocking my way?
</i>

17
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.600
At the current state, transplant is your only solution.

18
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.100
There isn't much that can be done other than (transplant) surgery.

19
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.000
Since you don't have ascites or sepsis yet,

20
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.400
you could receive treatments as an outpatient. If you could be hospitalized, that will be even better.

21
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.200
If there is a sudden onset of hepatic coma, it will be very difficult for you.

22
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.980
What did he say?

23
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.230
What did he say?

24
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.800
What

25
00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.100
am I going to do?

26
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.500
Were you planning on not telling me this time too?

27
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.100
No,

28
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.180
I said I have something to tell you yesterday.

29
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.200
You were going to leave after saying what you had to say.

30
00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.700
You said I shouldn't feel sorry.

31
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.600
But why do you keep making me sorry?

32
00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.600
How can you do this?

33
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.400
I was just going to

34
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.600
leave in a dashing manner.

35
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.900
How can it be dashing when you're leaving?

36
00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.580
What exactly have you done in your previous life

37
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.700
for your life to turn out nasty like this.

38
00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.480
That's not true.

39
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.400
Since I've met you

40
00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.950
I thought I had saved a country (done a great deed) in my previous life.

41
00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.200
♫ <i>It's an old longing to you, but</i> ♫

42
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.600
It hurts.

43
00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.290
Stop hitting me.

44
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.200
Don't die.

45
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.200
♫ <i>In such a sad story</i> ♫

46
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.600
If you die, I will kill you.

47
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:52.800
♫ <i>You're beautiful comfort to me</i> ♫

48
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.600
I won't leave you to die.

49
00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.600
I will be by your side till the end this time.

50
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.200
♫ <i>Inside this cold story</i> ♫

53

<i>Episode 16</i>

54
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.400
Patient Lee Gang Doo's emergency level, is it still the same?
<i>Organ Transplant Center</i>

55
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.800
His rank is still the same?

56
00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.800
It hasn't, he's still number two.

57
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.800
His condition worsened yesterday and was admitted as an emergency case. Shouldn't his number change?

58
00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.700
I don't decide his number on the waiting list.

59
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.900
There are patients waiting hospitalized in ICU.

60
00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.200
It's not something you can give just because you want to.

61
00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:14.400
Why? Because we're not related?

62
00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:22.000
Then, I can do it if I marry Gang Doo, right? I can marry him right away.

63
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.900
Even if you register your marriage, you could only do it after one year.

64
00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:29.800
Also you can't give it to him since you're smaller than him.

65
00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.600
Because I am smaller than him?

66
00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:37.000
Even if it's a match, the donor has to give 65% of her liver to the recipient.

67
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.400
With you're build, it won't do.

68
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:45.200
Your intention is enough.

69
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:50.300
I will try to do everything I can.

70
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:14.500
He's so handsome without any cuts.

71
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.800
He is bigger.

72
00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:51.290
Many customers who are traumatized after a car accident seek this out too.

73
00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:53.600
Is this the best one here?

74
00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.800
There isn't any more impressive model?

75
00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:00.200
If you want a more stylish vehicle, I will recommend you a different model.

76
00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.500
- Wait a moment.
 - Okay.

77
00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:06.390
You're going to decide on a car by how it looks?

78
00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.200
You should compare maintenance cost, fuel efficiency, how it feels when you ride it.

79
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.500
Hey! What's important for cars is not how it feels when you ride it but how it feels when you exit your car.

80
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:18.600
When you exit your car, everyone should be wowed by it.

81
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.200
You don't even ride it often.

82
00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:24.600
My mom hates me driving.

83
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:30.400
She doesn't trust me. But I must drive from now on.

84
00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:31.800
Why?

85
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:35.200
I don't want you giving me ride in your car.

86
00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:39.600
Are you embarrassed? Are you showing off how rich you are?

87
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:43.200
Yeah. I am gong to show off how I am rich I am.

88
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:47.200
Money doesn't make you happy.

89
00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:51.500
However, it is true that relatively many unhappiness can be avoided.

90
00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:58.240
You said your car used to belong to your uncle who used to beat you up.

91
00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:02.510
Sell it. Let's ride a new car.

92
00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.900
Here.

93
00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.200
Wait.

94
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:24.200
Moon Soo. I bought a car. Do you want to go anywhere?

95
00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:29.600
Hey! What's wrong?

96
00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:37.500
I mean, you two just want to love each other. Why is it so hard for you two.

97
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:43.400
Unni. I don't understand.

98
00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.800
Look at the life he lived.

99
00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:52.390
He survived such hardship,

100
00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:56.100
but he might die due to sickness.

101
00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:58.300
Does that make sense?

102
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:05.600
So he could die like this, (god) spared his life?

103
00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:11.460
Why is he doing this to Gang Doo?

104
00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.600
He has it hard enough as it is.

105
00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:20.000
Why does he make it harder for Gang Doo?

106
00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.300
It feels unfair.

107
00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.600
It's so unfair to us.

108
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:31.730
Don't cry.

109
00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:39.000
Rather, cry your eyes out when you're with me.

110
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.900
Don't cry when you're with Gang Doo.

111
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.400
Gang Doo is so pitiful, what am I to do?

112
00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:55.400
I am pitiful too, what am I to do?

113
00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.300
You cry for him like this, why is Gang Doo pitiful?

114
00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:13.000
Isn't 2-patient room too expensive?

115
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.400
I am a doctor.

116
00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:22.100
Then, do you get a employee discount or something?

117
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.800
How is it that we don't even have relatives that we're close to?

118
00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:32.570
Oppa.

119
00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.700
When mom was sick.

120
00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:41.600
Do you remember how I begged I want to sleep next to mom

121
00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.500
that I don't like the cot?

122
00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.200
Yeah.

123
00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:51.000
I decided to become a doctor back then.

124
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.700
If I become a doctor, I thought I will come to hospital only to cure people.

125
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:03.800
I didn't know it will turn out like this again.

126
00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:08.000
I am sorry.

127
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.800
If you're sorry, then don't die.

128
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.400
Don't leave me behind, by myself.

129
00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:08.780
I can't let Jae Yeong be alone.

130
00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:17.240
I can't really die.

131
00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:26.540
Gran told me to take my time to come see her.

132
00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:02.720
I knew you'd be doing this.

133
00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:10.180
- How did you?
- I left because I was in a condition to do so.

134
00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:14.440
Did you stay up and put this together by yourself?

135
00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:24.350
<i>Mother Im Jin Hae who used to wait for her son, Choi Il Do, every day by the front door.
We're waiting for you, Moon Byeong Ho.</i>

136
00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:42.090
<i>Our Captain who stayed behind till the end to do repair work</i>

137
00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:45.380
<i>Rebar Manager Mr. Lee Chel Woo</i>

138
00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:55.880
The work log you gave me,

139
00:15:55.880 --> 00:16:00.250
there were contact information of workers who worked with your father. So I contacted them

140
00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:03.800
and they only had praises for your father.

141
00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:18.810
<i>District A</i>

142
00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:21.350
You want this to be the memorial?

143
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:23.140
Yes.

144
00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:27.100
Wouldn't it be uncomfortable to look at this?

145
00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:29.730
I am not saying on behalf of the company.

146
00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:33.010
Some bereaved family members may think differently.

147
00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:35.620
Because it's uncomfortable.

148
00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:39.650
Because time has passed. Since we received compensation fund.

149
00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:42.330
We can't begin to forget like that.

150
00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:47.560
That's why same things keep on repeating.

151
00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:51.140
Memorial park isn't being built for our comfort.

152
00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:56.040
I vote for those words. Building it so it looks good isn't all there is to it.

153
00:16:56.890 --> 00:17:02.020
Let's keep it this way. Cheongyu needs to do so.

154
00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:04.080
I will try.

155
00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:09.420
By the way, are you sick?

156
00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:15.580
So this discussion is over. Please wrap it up well.

157
00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:30.520
Those two get along well together.

158
00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:35.930
Oh, wait.

159
00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:42.330
Bio Town, many things are different from how it's specified on the business plan.

160
00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:46.730
Use of laborers, materials and the processes too.

161
00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:51.040
It was all approved by Director Jeong Yoo Taek.

162
00:17:57.170 --> 00:17:58.270
Why are you giving this to me?

163
00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:02.790
Even if I were to give it to Cheongyu auditing department, they might cover it up.

164
00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:06.300
I thought it would be better to trust you.

165
00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:10.970
When they try to find the source, if it gets found out that Seowon brought this issue up...

166
00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:13.680
Seowon might not be able to get any work from Cheongyu in the future.

167
00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:20.070
I won't get involved. If it's like this, I shouldn't get involved in the future.

168
00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:26.530
Team Leader.

169
00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:30.010
This.

170
00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:33.000
What is this?

171
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.700
Mr. Lee Cheol Woo, Gang Doo's father.

172
00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.270
I checked the blueprint of the shopping mall.

173
00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:46.490
On August 5th, 2005, it says they cut the lower rebar of the elevator in District B.

174
00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:50.780
- The marking person made a mistake so it was pushed back.
- So what?

175
00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:54.580
He might have privately dealt the rebar that was cut at that time,

176
00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:58.890
But there are no evidence anywhere that Gang Doo's father smuggled out any rebars.

177
00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:02.060
I guess many people have high expectations of me.

178
00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:06.100
You could set things right.

179
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:11.660
Please, I ask you.

180
00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:16.470
Mr. Lee Gang Doo must feel someone has his back.

181
00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:30.060
I've heard that Mr. Lee Gang Doo quit his on site job too. Is there something going on between you two?

182
00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:33.490
No, nothing will happen.

183
00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:43.450
I handed over the blueprint and the model to the design team. Also I've updated So Mi on any future work that needs to be done.

184
00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:45.260
Thank you for your work.

185
00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:48.240
Moon Soo.

186
00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.710
Yes.

187
00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:53.930
We will contact the family members of the bereaved.

188
00:19:54.940 --> 00:20:00.050
The remains found at the site wasn't a match to the DNA of the victim who was never found.

189
00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:06.450
We have decided to compare it to other victims if the bereaved family wants it.

190
00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:11.870
- If you don't want that—
- No, that might be my younger sister.

191
00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:20.980
Only my dad saw how Yeon Su was at the end. But her body was seriously disfigured that he wouldn't allow my mom to see her.

192
00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:23.940
My dad was really angry then.

193
00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:30.630
When I look back on it, I think he coped by getting angry.

194
00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:38.720
Oh, right. You saw my dad in front of the restaurant.

195
00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:40.950
Yes.

196
00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:43.420
The restaurant is closing down. Before that—

197
00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:48.430
No, I don't think I'll be able to go that far yet.

198
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:55.250
However, I understand that he was angry.

199
00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:56.720
Pardon?

200
00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:02.620
I will be able to see you again at the memorial park with Lee Gang Doo.

201
00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:12.650
Thank you. Thanks to you and Lee Gang Doo, I was able to keep myself in line.

202
00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:33.950
Isn't the name of this bus stop ridiculous?

203
00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:40.030
Look. It says "Front of S Mall." That's been gone for some time already.

204
00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:42.210
Why do you remember that?

205
00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:46.570
I don't forget anything now. Anything that's related to you.

206
00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:57.610
I am proud of you.

207
00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:01.520
I am really proud of ourselves.

208
00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:29.740
Doctor. You don't come by often lately. Are you really busy?

209
00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:31.700
Yes.

210
00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:38.640
- Then. 
 - This is good. I came to ask a question.

211
00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:42.970
Let me at least get tested. I've heard that the liver grows back.

212
00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:44.640
It's not something you could decide so easily like that—

213
00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:48.680
Who said it's easy? It's not easy.

214
00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:52.430
I've looked away when my father died of liver cancer.

215
00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:53.890
Pardon?

216
00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:57.260
But I will give it to Gang Doo.

217
00:22:57.260 --> 00:23:00.910
I could get tested, right?

218
00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:15.910
Thank you.

219
00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:20.000
- What does your older brother do?
- Pardon?

220
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.020
What kind of life did he live that so many people are willing to give their livers?

221
00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:25.600
What?

222
00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:31.360
It would have been dangerous if it was any later but it's good that a match has been found in preliminary testing.

223
00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:34.270
What are you doing? Take it.

224
00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:46.170
<i>Result of the blood test, Ahn Sang Man. Blood type:
O</i>

225
00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:49.960
Usually, unless you're a family member or a relative,

226
00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:53.250
people might get suspicious that you're trying to sell your organ.

227
00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:56.590
However, hyung's address is here.

228
00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:59.020
In order to prove that we lived together for more than 8 years,

229
00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:05.630
I had to even go to the city hall. It was very difficult, Mom.

230
00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:08.690
I couldn't even eat for 6 hours.

231
00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:13.420
Also, they poured something cold into my stomach. They drew many vials of blood too.

232
00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:15.490
What are you saying now?

233
00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:18.070
Were you listening when I've explained everything?

234
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:21.030
If I share mine, hyung could survive.

235
00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:25.210
Stop saying useless things. You can't take even one step out from now own, do you understand?

236
00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:26.830
Mom!

237
00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:28.260
Listen to Mom's words.

238
00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:33.320
Mom! I want to be useful too.

239
00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:39.740
Oh, this thoughtless rascal. How can you stay that to your mother?

240
00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:42.070
Mom.

241
00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:47.640
Don't regard it as giving but instead gaining.

242
00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:55.710
I am not giving a liver to hyung, instead you're gaining another son. Isn't that lucky?

243
00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:58.020
- Be quiet. Throw this out.
- Oh, mom.

244
00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:00.510
- No way. 
- No, mom.

245
00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:03.530
- Mom.
- You can never go out. This fool.

246
00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:07.310
You could give other things, but how can you give that? This fool.

247
00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:09.760
Mom.

248
00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:12.010
Oppa!

249
00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:18.400
No matter how desperate you are, how can you do that to Sang Man? To Sang Man!

250
00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:21.210
Oppa!

251
00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:26.770
No matter how desperate you are, how can you do that to Sang Man? To Sang Man!

252
00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:30.720
That was Sang Man's decision. Why can't you understand Sang Man?

253
00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:32.460
Still, you should have stopped him!

254
00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:36.500
Why should I stop him? Saving you comes first.

255
00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:38.140
- You're fired.
- What?

256
00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:43.140
I said you're fired. It's not only doctors who could be selective in taking patients.

257
00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:45.900
Patients should be able to fire their doctors too.

258
00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:46.850
Gang Doo.

259
00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:51.880
You don't have anything but why do you keep his pride? Just throw that stupid thing away and please!

260
00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:54.240
If I throw that away too,

261
00:25:57.270 --> 00:25:59.200
how can I live?

262
00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:03.440
When I know that I will destroy it,

263
00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:07.040
how can I live happily taking Sang Man's?

264
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.240
Sang Man, come out. You'll really get in trouble with me if you don't.

265
00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:27.380
Sang Man. Open the door. I said open the door.

266
00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:30.470
- Mom.
- Open the door.

267
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:36.410
I can't live if I don't have you or hyung.

268
00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:50.270
So, you need to allow me to live with hyung.

269
00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:48.910
Aren't you coming home?

270
00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:57.040
Please understand my acting like this. Too bad if I come across as being heartless.

271
00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:02.750
Which mother would agree to her kid's body being cut open to share his organ?

272
00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:07.300
I know.

273
00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:14.360
Geez, I've known you for ten years. Yet I am being like this.

274
00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:18.070
People are petty like this.

275
00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:22.500
I am sorry, Gang Doo.

276
00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:26.670
Stop, Ahjumma.

277
00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:31.580
Why would you feel sorry? I am the one who should be sorry.

278
00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:38.910
Don't worry. I won't allow him to go through with it.

279
00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:43.110
Even if Sang Man insists, I won't agree to it.

280
00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:50.020
But what can you do? Sang Man needs to live first.

281
00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:55.730
If I leave him like that, I am afraid he will be the first one to die.

282
00:28:56.540 --> 00:29:00.830
When I already know that no one can change his mind once Sang Man's stubbornness kicks in,

283
00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:07.190
I had to try to stop him at least once. I could be more at peace that way.

284
00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:11.590
Why are you being like this too?

285
00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:18.330
Since it turned out like this already, I guess you and Sang Man will become real brothers.

286
00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:24.210
Since I've gained a troublesome son like you, it seems like I will have tighten my belt even tighter.

287
00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:28.130
Please live a long long time and carry out your filial duties. You must.

288
00:29:48.090 --> 00:29:49.950
Gang Doo.

289
00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:57.520
I understand how you feel and I understand how Sang Man feels too.

290
00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:01.790
Then it was difficult to even think about who's correct.

291
00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:05.860
So how hard it must be for you.

292
00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:10.900
It's hardest for you now.

293
00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:15.180
I won't do it.

294
00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:18.420
You're being like this because you feel bad towards Sang Man, right?

295
00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:24.730
Going through with the surgery, you think you're being greedy, right?

296
00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:31.320
But you're wrong

297
00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:37.830
You're not the one being greedy, but it's us that's being greedy.

298
00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:46.450
No matter how difficult it is for you, it's our greed that wants you alive next to us.

299
00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:52.200
So you don't have a choice in this matter.

300
00:30:55.630 --> 00:31:02.430
Even though it may be hard, you just need to live.

301

<i>Seaweed Rolls. Noodles</i>

302
00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:24.430
I've heard that you're quitting the restaurant.

303
00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:32.770
A position opened up in driving tour buses.

304
00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:36.210
Your urge to wander around.

305
00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:41.070
Geez, how did you endure it here for ten years?

306
00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:49.360
Why did you choose here of all the places?

307
00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:54.660
When it's so close by. Why?

308
00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:01.730
Is that your way of coping?

309
00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:40.530
In our relationship, we don't talk anymore.

310
00:32:59.950 --> 00:33:04.620
Divorce... Let's do that.

311
00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:14.490
So that we end up worse than strangers, we fought each other

312
00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:18.280
for more than twenty years

313
00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:23.330
till no end. Like a fool.

314
00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:34.990
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Fated Lovers Team @ viki</i>

315
00:33:56.200 --> 00:34:00.330
Starting with Bio Town, Cheongyu have decided

316
00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:05.330
against any outsourcing and multiple level of subcontracting out, practices widely accepted in the construction industry.

317
00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:11.990
It's also our intention to not repeat the catastrophe of 13 years ago.

318
00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:17.210
Since memorial park will be built at the entrance of town, we put how it harmonizes with its surroundings as our priority.

319
00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:22.960
Also, the survivors of the catastrophe Lee Gang Doo and Ha Moon Soo is personally involved in this project,

320
00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:27.290
we paid special care in considering the victim's family as well.

321
00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:35.780
What's going on? Move aside. Don't you know who I am?

322
00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:37.770
Only board of directors can attend this meeting.

323
00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:39.100
I am a director.

324
00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:45.980
Manager Jeong Yoo Jin told me you've been released from the boardship position.

325
00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:47.530
What?

326
00:34:57.910 --> 00:35:01.750
Please take a good care of Cheongyu Environments from now on. That's the place Cheongyu began.

327
00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:11.200
Hey, Jeong Yoo Jin. You of all people, you stab me in the back?

328
00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:13.830
Since it's me, I am doing this.

329
00:35:13.830 --> 00:35:17.500
Since you're my older brother, I am not giving up.

330
00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:19.100
What?

331
00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:24.660
Believe me. More than anyone, I want you to turn out okay.

332
00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:30.260
Please empty the office as soon as possible.

333
00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:34.420
Hey! Jeong Yoon Jin!

334
00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:38.600
Did you go to the hospital?

335
00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:42.570
Shall we meet in the evening?

336
00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:45.710
Is there anything you want to eat?

337
00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:48.520
You're not sick?

338
00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:50.890
What did your sister say?

339
00:35:50.890 --> 00:35:55.220
- Hyung. 
 - Did you receive all the medicine?

340
00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:02.340
You could leave. You have one more test left, but it should be alright, Sang Man.

341
00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:06.640
You don't have any pneumothorax or fatty liver. The size of your liver is good too.

342
00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:13.500
Hyung. Don't look like that.

343
00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:17.810
At times like this, you just need to say thank you.

344
00:36:18.890 --> 00:36:23.250
I am so thankful, I can't bring myself to say those words.

345
00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:26.710
Your paperwork is perfect too. So you'll get approved.

346
00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:30.110
Once it's been approved, I will schedule the surgery right away.

347
00:36:30.110 --> 00:36:33.830
So you must not drink any liquor from now on.

348
00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:35.380
Let's go.

349
00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:39.060
Leave. Make sure to answer when I call.

350
00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:40.830
Work hard.

351
00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:52.450
- Oh, why?
- Smile, hyung.

352
00:36:52.450 --> 00:36:56.930
Do you remember what Cho Woo said in Warrior Guard?

353
00:36:56.930 --> 00:36:58.060
I don't.

354
00:36:58.060 --> 00:37:03.920
"A person who needs to protect something (someone) doesn't die easily." Do you remember?

355
00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:08.500
I remember. Right.

356
00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:12.660
That's why, don't worry. We won't die.

357
00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:20.620
See you later, hyung.

358
00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:36.460
Cheongyu Jeong Yoo Jin.

359
00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:44.360
I was going to buy you something yummy.

360
00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:47.100
This tastes most yummy to me.

361
00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:50.650
Why? Another dating consultation?

362
00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:55.390
I was worried after hearing you're at the hospital. But it seems like you have enough energy to joke.

363
00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:59.710
Ask when I have energy. So you won't regret later.

364
00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:08.090
Then...With my looks, qualifications, and a good family too.

365
00:38:08.090 --> 00:38:10.790
Why do you think I don't have a boyfriend?

366
00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:13.890
You're too outstanding.

367
00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:22.470
This stupid group of men have this useless disease in which they get tired out by outstanding women.

368
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:25.850
So don't worry about those stupid jerks.

369
00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:30.090
Then how about Moon Soo? Is Moon Soo popular since she's mediocre?

370
00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:34.780
Look here. My Moon Soo is very outstanding and a good person.

371
00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:40.290
It's just that a courageous man like me is hard to find.

372
00:38:40.290 --> 00:38:42.820
She must be happy, Ha Moon Soo.

373
00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:47.850
I'm embarrassed.

374
00:38:47.850 --> 00:38:51.220
Talk about embarrassing and humiliating things too.

375
00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:56.450
Don't just keep it to yourself. It's better for your health to talk about them.

376
00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:00.100
Don't be sick.

377
00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:05.270
You're my only friend to whom I can share embarrassing things with.

378
00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:12.340
This is the real reason for my visit.

379
00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:26.750
The unpaid compensation to your father from the collapse.
<i>Letter of Apology</i>

380
00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:31.570
If it wasn't for Ha Moon Soo, that would have been overlooked.

381
00:39:31.570 --> 00:39:35.140
I am sorry for being late.

382
00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:44.600
It was discovered that the rebar your father took was a discarded rebar with no monetary value.

383
00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:53.360
Even though Mr. Lee Chul Woo, who died in the collapse, cannot be held for liable for the cost, Cheongyu didn't pay the compensation fund.

384
00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:59.910
I apologize again.

385
00:40:12.070 --> 00:40:13.430
Jae Yeong.

386
00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:16.930
Professor. Please. It might be different once you open him up.

387
00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:19.840
Can you please reconsider?

388
00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:27.470
Look. The donor has deformity in his artery and even his biliary tract is a case that's difficult to operate.

389
00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:32.060
I will convince him. You could at least try to open him up.

390
00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:34.260
Once you open him up, it might be milder than the images.

391
00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:36.430
If Mr. Ahn Sang Man agrees to it, we could go through with it.

392
00:40:36.430 --> 00:40:41.270
But if we do so, what if he suffers biliary tract stenosis and complications? What will you do then?

393
00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:42.430
You're saying you could do it, right?

394
00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:43.200
Hey!

395
00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:47.450
Risk is too high. Let's keep doing maintenance treatment for now—

396
00:40:47.450 --> 00:40:50.070
Hey. Hey!

397
00:41:00.970 --> 00:41:02.500
Where are you going?

398
00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:03.930
Why did you come back?

399
00:41:03.930 --> 00:41:06.000
Are you going to Sang Man?

400
00:41:11.450 --> 00:41:14.110
What are you going to do when you go see him?

401
00:41:14.110 --> 00:41:18.700
What else? I'll tell him to prepare for the surgery.

402
00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:23.830
Stop it.

403
00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:26.040
Stop what?

404
00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:31.680
You... Sang Man...

405
00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:42.870
- You've done enough. 
 - Do what?

406
00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:46.190
What did I do?

407
00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:47.840
What did I do for you, Oppa?

408
00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:50.680
You did a lot.

409
00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:55.880
You did a lot, so stop it now.

410
00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:26.450
Oh. Thanks for accepting my employees.

411
00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:33.790
<i>[ Moksan City Library 
 Design Competition Proposal ]</i>
There will be a proposal for Moksan City Library design competition next month.

412
00:42:33.790 --> 00:42:35.710
Why are you giving this to me?

413
00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:38.350
There's no reason Cheongyu and Seo Won will work together in the future.

414
00:42:38.350 --> 00:42:42.630
I haven't seen another architect who is as capable as you.

415
00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:49.030
I told you before. Let's have a working relationship, not a personal relationship.

416
00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:52.790
No. I don't think this is a project for me.

417
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:57.170
While I'm downsizing my office, I want to work on a project I really wanted to work on.

418
00:42:57.170 --> 00:42:58.410
Still, this project is...

419
00:42:58.410 --> 00:43:03.250
And... our relationship is quite personal in nature.

420
00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:07.010
My mother is also your mother.

421
00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:35.990
You didn't leave yet?

422
00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:40.350
I'm not leaving.

423
00:43:40.350 --> 00:43:43.330
No matter how small an office is, you still need a marketing person.

424
00:43:43.330 --> 00:43:45.260
I'm good at marketing.

425
00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:48.260
Of course, I can design and I'm good at making models now.

426
00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:50.450
- Thanks. 
 - Pardon?

427
00:43:50.450 --> 00:43:55.600
I'm grateful for your heart, but you'll be great at Cheongyu, too.

428
00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:57.640
Don't worry.

429
00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:01.220
See you again.

430
00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:09.200
He's so cool to the end.

431
00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:18.140
Are you really going?

432
00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:20.630
Yeah.

433
00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:22.530
Really?

434
00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:26.620
Are you doing this out of anger because you got a divorce?

435
00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:29.840
- Think it over... 
 - Am I going to somewhere strange?

436
00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:34.570
I can't quit drinking by myself. So, I'm trying to get some help.

437
00:44:34.570 --> 00:44:37.590
While this place is getting fixed up, let me get fixed up, too.

438
00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:40.020
I have to be healthy in order for you to be comfortable.

439
00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:41.730
You're not running away from me?

440
00:44:41.730 --> 00:44:44.650
I'm trying to stay by your side for a very long time.

441
00:44:44.650 --> 00:44:47.510
Don't you dare say you're sick of me.

442
00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:59.270
They say there aren't any fingers that don't hurt if you bite them. But each of them hurt differently.

443
00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:07.060
You and Yeon Soo are different. I'm not saying one of you is more valuable over the other.

444
00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:10.760
Do you understand?

445
00:45:18.290 --> 00:45:22.070
I can't drink once I go in there. Should I drink one more bottle before I go?

446
00:45:22.070 --> 00:45:23.360
Mom.

447
00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:25.300
Hey, just one bottle.

448
00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:27.130
You can't.

449
00:45:27.130 --> 00:45:29.520
Hey, let me just have one glass.

450
00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:30.560
You can't.

451
00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:32.760
Geez, this girl!

452
00:45:37.590 --> 00:45:42.070
<i>She says I can play tomorrow. Jae Yeong gave me permission.</i>

453
00:46:34.770 --> 00:46:36.340
Did you wait long?

454
00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:38.160
No.

455
00:46:40.050 --> 00:46:43.480
Ah. I have lots of money.

456
00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:45.440
Huh?

457
00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:49.970
Thanks to you... I got money all of a sudden.

458
00:46:49.970 --> 00:46:51.560
Huh?

459
00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:58.690
Everything you do is so pretty.

460
00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:03.000
You were born to be loved by me, right?

461
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.650
What the heck...

462
00:47:04.650 --> 00:47:06.610
Stay still.

463
00:47:06.610 --> 00:47:09.230
Why?

464
00:47:09.230 --> 00:47:11.130
I'm thankful.

465
00:47:25.730 --> 00:47:27.570
Is there anywhere you want to go to?

466
00:47:27.570 --> 00:47:29.670
I don't know.

467
00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:33.600
I told you I have lots of money.

468
00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:35.820
I can spend all this money today.

469
00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:39.220
Didn't you have things you wanted to do when you got some money?

470
00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:47.030
I wanted to pay off my debt.

471
00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:53.410
Shall we pay off debt then?

472
00:47:53.410 --> 00:47:55.540
I did all that already.

473
00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:56.700
How?

474
00:47:56.700 --> 00:48:01.980
In any case... So, you can do whatever you want to do.

475
00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:18.000
- Over there. 
 - Huh?

476
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.680
That's the place So Mi was talking about.

477
00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:21.240
Where?

478
00:48:23.170 --> 00:48:25.770

- Hey, hey, hey. 
 - You said do whatever I want to do.

479
00:48:25.770 --> 00:48:27.200
Well, that's...

480
00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:28.950

I know what kind of place that is. So, let's go inside.

487

I think we walked too much. Let's just get some rest.

Did you have some weird thoughts?

I really won't do anything. I'll be still.

Why are you holding yourself back?

496
00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:31.050
- Are you asking me that because you don't know? 
 - Forget it.

497
00:49:31.050 --> 00:49:37.630
Had I known, I should've asked you to go to an island. So that we can miss the last boat.

498
00:49:38.870 --> 00:49:45.290
Don't laugh. Even if you beg me to go now, I won't go.

499
00:49:45.290 --> 00:49:47.230
Let's go together.

501
00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:58.260
Forget it.

502
00:49:58.260 --> 00:49:59.430
Why are you acting this way?

503
00:49:59.430 --> 00:50:02.750
Why do you only think of yourself?

504
00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:07.020
I'm greedy for the first time in my life. And that's you.

I didn't mean that I wanted to come to such a nice place.

509
00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:47.350
It's okay.

510

Gang Doo. Gang Doo, look in here. There's another room.

514
00:51:12.990 --> 00:51:15.340
It's so big.

515
00:51:28.830 --> 00:51:33.470
Gang Doo, the towel here is huge. It's bigger than me.

516
00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:39.820
It covers everything, right?

517

Hey, you're going to get in trouble.

The bed is huge.

520
00:51:59.010 --> 00:52:04.280
Gang Doo, lie down. More than ten of me can lie down here.

Then, we wouldn't have had to come around a full circle and could've been together longer.
