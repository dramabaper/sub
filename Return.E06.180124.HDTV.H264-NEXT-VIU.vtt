The face is not shown in any of the cameras.

2
00:00:18.391 --> 00:00:20.621
All right. Get that out of the way.

3
00:00:21.361 --> 00:00:22.961
Gosh, I'm hungry.

4
00:00:35.372 --> 00:00:36.372
What is this?

("Murder of an Old Money's Mistress")

7
00:00:41.812 --> 00:00:43.251
Okay.

8
00:00:45.382 --> 00:00:46.382
I got you.

(Gangdong Precinct)

10
00:00:48.452 --> 00:00:49.452
Hey, Kim Dong Bae.

11
00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:52.492
What happened to our case?

12
00:00:52.522 --> 00:00:53.522
What do you mean?

13
00:00:53.522 --> 00:00:54.791
Haven't you seen the internet news?

14
00:00:55.191 --> 00:00:58.331
- The suspect's name went viral. - Pardon?

15
00:00:58.391 --> 00:01:01.662
He once was a hot shot current news journalist in a major agency.

16
00:01:01.831 --> 00:01:04.771
He's known as the Untouchable, who knows no morals of the trade.

17
00:01:04.902 --> 00:01:08.001
He kept messing things up wherever he went...

18
00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:09.501
and lost his ground at the agency.

19
00:01:09.911 --> 00:01:13.141
Now, he's the chief editor for a third-tier agency.

20
00:01:16.911 --> 00:01:17.911
Seriously.

21
00:01:18.512 --> 00:01:21.822
Taeha is the only group that starts with T among the top 10 companies.

22
00:01:22.322 --> 00:01:25.792
Besides, it says, "The director of the Strategy and Planning Team,"

23
00:01:25.851 --> 00:01:28.922
Mr. K, won the Entrepreneur of the Year in 2015."

24
00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:31.161
This journalist practically gave his real name to the viewers.

25
00:01:31.562 --> 00:01:32.562
Shoot.

26
00:01:32.792 --> 00:01:35.032
He wrote about the relationship between the victim and Kang In Ho...

27
00:01:35.462 --> 00:01:38.771
and even our investigation in detail as if he watched everything happen.

28
00:01:39.572 --> 00:01:40.572
What? What is it?

29
00:01:40.572 --> 00:01:42.402
Are you sure you didn't slip out?

30
00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:43.441
Have you gone mad?

31
00:01:51.652 --> 00:01:53.351
You must be aware of the online article.

32
00:01:53.351 --> 00:01:54.422
We had nothing to do with it either.

33
00:01:54.422 --> 00:01:57.691
I doubt that. The summary of the investigation was very clear.

34
00:01:57.691 --> 00:02:00.521
Sue us for compensation if necessary then.

35
00:02:00.792 --> 00:02:03.361
Right. We'll finish our first investigation tomorrow...

36
00:02:03.361 --> 00:02:05.131
and hand over the case file to the prosecution.

37
00:02:16.541 --> 00:02:17.571
Joon Hee.

38
00:02:18.911 --> 00:02:20.511
I know you are in there.

39
00:02:21.642 --> 00:02:23.011
Please open up.

40
00:02:30.351 --> 00:02:32.092
You're the only one...

41
00:02:34.092 --> 00:02:35.862
who can help In Ho.

42
00:02:37.062 --> 00:02:39.092
- Why is she doing this? - You must've known it too.

43
00:02:39.092 --> 00:02:42.101
- In Ho took good care of you. - Please. Please.

44
00:02:44.302 --> 00:02:45.471
When he looked out for you,

45
00:02:46.601 --> 00:02:47.642
I asked him...

46
00:02:47.742 --> 00:02:50.071
- why he looked out only for you. - No.

47
00:02:50.071 --> 00:02:51.071
In Ho.

48
00:02:55.182 --> 00:02:56.411
He said that...

49
00:02:59.721 --> 00:03:01.751
even though you were his friend, he saw you as his younger brother.

50
00:03:03.122 --> 00:03:04.152
In Ho.

51
00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:08.462
He told me...

52
00:03:10.462 --> 00:03:12.832
that he felt sad and sympathized with you.

53
00:03:13.161 --> 00:03:14.802
That's why he felt compelled to take care of you.

54
00:03:20.001 --> 00:03:21.041
Joon Hee.

55
00:03:22.742 --> 00:03:25.441
Please help In Ho. Please?

56
00:03:36.152 --> 00:03:37.152
You stupid...

57
00:03:38.351 --> 00:03:39.661
You stupid moron.

58
00:03:42.862 --> 00:03:44.362
That's ludicrous.

59
00:03:44.691 --> 00:03:45.691
Where are you now?

60
00:03:46.962 --> 00:03:49.101
Hi. Hello.

61
00:03:49.332 --> 00:03:50.671
I'm on my way to the precinct.

62
00:03:50.932 --> 00:03:53.171
Joon. Joon Hee.

63
00:03:53.742 --> 00:03:55.302
Why don't you meet me first?

64
00:03:55.372 --> 00:03:57.872
Let's meet and talk first.

65
00:03:57.971 --> 00:03:59.441
Talk about what?

66
00:04:00.082 --> 00:04:02.041
That we will frame In Ho for the murder?

67
00:04:02.342 --> 00:04:03.451
If it's that, I don't want to.

68
00:04:03.612 --> 00:04:05.082
Joon Hee. Joon Hee.

69
00:04:05.511 --> 00:04:07.682
You know that he didn't kill her.

70
00:04:08.082 --> 00:04:10.022
You, Bum, and I all know that.

71
00:04:10.122 --> 00:04:12.291
Then we'll end up taking the fall for it.

72
00:04:12.721 --> 00:04:13.892
I didn't kill her.

73
00:04:13.992 --> 00:04:15.692
You and I are in the same boat.

74
00:04:15.962 --> 00:04:19.361
Then what are you afraid of? Why are we framing In Ho for the murder?

75
00:04:19.632 --> 00:04:21.962
We can tell the police, and they can find the real murderer.

76
00:04:22.101 --> 00:04:24.931
We abandoned the body. We did it together. Did you forget?

77
00:04:30.072 --> 00:04:32.241
My company went public only a while ago.

78
00:04:32.241 --> 00:04:35.681
What if people found out that the CEO is involved in a murder?

79
00:04:37.282 --> 00:04:38.351
It won't hurt just me.

80
00:04:39.181 --> 00:04:40.181
What about you?

81
00:04:40.752 --> 00:04:43.152
What about your father, who treats his reputation like his life?

82
00:04:43.621 --> 00:04:45.022
What about your hospital?

83
00:04:45.892 --> 00:04:48.421
You... You want to frame our friend...

84
00:04:48.592 --> 00:04:50.361
just to cover up our crime?

85
00:04:52.532 --> 00:04:54.431
I can't do that, Tae Suk.

86
00:04:57.502 --> 00:04:59.272
This isn't right.

87
00:05:02.471 --> 00:05:04.311
This isn't right.

00:05:10.481 --> 00:05:11.551
What is it?

90
00:05:12.351 --> 00:05:15.121
Hey, that lunatic, Joon Hee is on his way to turn himself in.

91
00:05:15.752 --> 00:05:16.791
This is very bad.

92
00:05:17.252 --> 00:05:18.952
I tried to talk to him on the phone and stop him,

93
00:05:19.491 --> 00:05:20.522
but he won't listen.

94
00:05:21.491 --> 00:05:22.491
Okay.

95
00:05:23.892 --> 00:05:26.431
Gosh, this crazy jerk. Seriously.

96
00:05:28.262 --> 00:05:30.902
Mr. Kim? This is an emergency.

97
00:05:31.231 --> 00:05:34.541
There's a matter you must take care of now. Get going. Okay.

98
00:05:42.611 --> 00:05:43.712
Yes, Joon Hee.

99
00:05:45.111 --> 00:05:46.111
In Ho...

100
00:05:47.382 --> 00:05:48.481
will get out.

101
00:05:49.022 --> 00:05:50.022
Sorry?

102
00:05:51.252 --> 00:05:53.621
Joon Hee, what do you mean?

103
00:05:53.991 --> 00:05:55.022
In Ho...

104
00:05:56.462 --> 00:05:57.762
didn't do anything.

105
00:05:58.892 --> 00:06:00.262
You must believe that.

106
00:06:01.902 --> 00:06:04.171
Please elaborate on what you just said.

107
00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:06.502
In Ho didn't murder her.

108
00:06:09.611 --> 00:06:11.971
Are you saying that you know who killed Mi Jung?

109
00:06:12.642 --> 00:06:15.142
No. I don't know who killed her.

110
00:06:15.411 --> 00:06:16.752
Please tell me what's going on.

111
00:06:16.811 --> 00:06:19.512
No. Where are you now? I'll come to you.

I'm in front of the precinct to see In Ho.

115
00:06:30.231 --> 00:06:31.262
I will...

116
00:06:33.801 --> 00:06:35.431
prove his innocence.

117
00:06:36.902 --> 00:06:37.902
I will...

118
00:06:38.871 --> 00:06:41.601
send In Ho back home.

119
00:06:43.471 --> 00:06:44.512
Just know that, okay?

120
00:06:45.072 --> 00:06:46.072

Great.

129
00:08:25.012 --> 00:08:28.241
By the way, did something happen outside? Why is it so noisy?

130
00:08:28.611 --> 00:08:31.082
Oh, that? A crazy jerk caused a car accident...

131
00:08:31.082 --> 00:08:32.752
and fled after leaving behind the vehicle.

132
00:08:32.752 --> 00:08:36.691
What kind of lunatic would cause a commotion in front of a precinct?

133
00:08:36.691 --> 00:08:39.191
It could be about money. He crashed into the other guy's vehicle,

134
00:08:39.191 --> 00:08:41.862
got on the car, and drove away.

135
00:08:41.992 --> 00:08:46.301
- It's a country of the outlaws. - I agree. My goodness.

136
00:08:46.801 --> 00:08:49.872
Gosh, my worries about my country ages me. Seriously.

137
00:08:56.102 --> 00:08:58.612
Ms. Choi, this is Na Ra.

138
00:08:58.872 --> 00:09:00.841
I was about to call you anyway.

139
00:09:00.982 --> 00:09:02.142
Could it be...

140
00:09:02.142 --> 00:09:04.951
Yes, I think it'll get sent to the prosecutor tomorrow.

141
00:09:06.252 --> 00:09:09.451
Yes. I'm going to see In Ho about that now.

142
00:09:09.791 --> 00:09:11.951
Okay. I just left to head that way too.

143
00:09:12.591 --> 00:09:14.392
I just spoke with Joon Hee.

144
00:09:15.122 --> 00:09:16.161
What did he say?

145
00:09:16.161 --> 00:09:18.232
He said In Ho is innocent,

146
00:09:18.291 --> 00:09:20.201
and that he's heading to the police station now.

147
00:09:22.502 --> 00:09:24.701
Did he say he knew who the killer was?

148
00:09:25.201 --> 00:09:26.502
I don't think so.

149
00:09:26.841 --> 00:09:28.701
Let's talk more at the police station.

150
00:09:29.341 --> 00:09:30.341
Okay.

151
00:09:32.372 --> 00:09:34.512
Drink some water if your throat's dry.

152
00:09:35.811 --> 00:09:37.782
If you didn't do it, you should eat and drink more,

153
00:09:37.782 --> 00:09:39.551
so you can prove your innocence.

154
00:09:41.681 --> 00:09:43.722
Do you have any more questions?

155
00:09:45.852 --> 00:09:48.321
I heard you haven't drunk a drop of water in three days.

156
00:09:49.022 --> 00:09:51.461
I called you here so that you could eat comfortably.

157
00:09:54.132 --> 00:09:58.201
I heard the prosecutor is taking over the case.

158
00:09:59.532 --> 00:10:01.201
It would've been nice if you had confessed,

159
00:10:02.502 --> 00:10:03.811
but we found evidence.

160
00:10:08.811 --> 00:10:09.811
Wait.

161
00:10:10.951 --> 00:10:14.352
But I didn't kill her.

162
00:10:14.352 --> 00:10:15.722
What evidence?

163
00:10:29.402 --> 00:10:31.331
Kang In Ho's lawyer is here.

164
00:10:31.671 --> 00:10:33.071
She wants to see him.

165
00:10:40.211 --> 00:10:41.612
What do you mean?

166
00:10:42.112 --> 00:10:44.581
Who proved Kang In Ho's innocence?

167
00:10:44.652 --> 00:10:47.482
No one came to see you? Really?

168
00:10:47.782 --> 00:10:49.522
No, no one.

169
00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:54.862
Let me make a call.

170
00:11:01.431 --> 00:11:03.002
- I'm here. - Hey.

171
00:11:07.671 --> 00:11:09.472
So what's his friend's name again?

172
00:11:09.571 --> 00:11:11.612
Seo Joon Hee, from Daemyung Hospital.

173
00:11:11.972 --> 00:11:15.041
Daemyung Hospital. Seo... Seo Joon Hee.

174
00:11:22.722 --> 00:11:24.421
Kim Hak Bum and Seo Joon Hee?

175
00:11:24.992 --> 00:11:26.961
How do you know Hak Bum?

176
00:11:30.492 --> 00:11:34.002
No wonder. I thought the name, "Kang In Ho", sounded familiar.

177
00:11:34.002 --> 00:11:37.602
Anyway, Joon Hee said he'd clear my husband's name,

178
00:11:37.602 --> 00:11:39.972
and that he was in front of the police station.

179
00:11:40.102 --> 00:11:41.642
They haven't changed...

180
00:11:42.441 --> 00:11:43.941
even after 10 years.

181
00:11:44.472 --> 00:11:45.911
What do you mean?

182
00:11:46.742 --> 00:11:48.782
I can't give you the details,

183
00:11:49.411 --> 00:11:51.752
but let me tell you this.

184
00:11:52.652 --> 00:11:56.291
Just know that you won't get your way this time.

185
00:11:56.451 --> 00:11:58.992
You threw your money around...

186
00:11:58.992 --> 00:12:00.791
and strong-armed people with your power,

187
00:12:01.022 --> 00:12:03.732
so it was a piece of cake to make your wrongdoings...

188
00:12:03.732 --> 00:12:05.461
disappear into thin air,

189
00:12:05.732 --> 00:12:07.732
but not any longer. Why not?

190
00:12:08.161 --> 00:12:11.671
Because I didn't get older only, but I've become experienced too.

191
00:12:14.671 --> 00:12:15.902
What do you...

192
00:12:15.902 --> 00:12:17.772
Hold on. I'll go.

193
00:12:18.811 --> 00:12:21.581
Excuse me. Detective Dokgo.

194
00:12:28.622 --> 00:12:31.852
You'll just ignore this reasonable doubt?

195
00:12:31.852 --> 00:12:34.091
There was reasonable doubt nine years ago.

196
00:12:35.522 --> 00:12:38.892
Once again, they must think if they use what they have...

197
00:12:38.892 --> 00:12:41.632
to cover up their poop,

198
00:12:41.632 --> 00:12:43.201
no one will see it,

199
00:12:44.232 --> 00:12:45.431
but what about the smell?

200
00:12:47.102 --> 00:12:50.571
I don't know what happened nine years ago,

201
00:12:50.571 --> 00:12:53.382
but it isn't right to be prejudiced because of that.

202
00:12:53.581 --> 00:12:54.841
Do you even know...

203
00:12:55.811 --> 00:12:58.911
what those jerks did while relying on their parents' money and power?

204
00:12:59.311 --> 00:13:00.652
Forget even reaching a trial.

205
00:13:00.782 --> 00:13:04.091
That stupid law that wags its tail in front of money and power?

206
00:13:04.722 --> 00:13:06.992
- That's all garbage. - You're right.

207
00:13:07.262 --> 00:13:11.262
You're right. It's true that the law is tolerant toward money and power.

208
00:13:11.862 --> 00:13:14.532
Nonetheless, a police officer...

209
00:13:14.532 --> 00:13:17.171
must treat everyone equally.

210
00:13:17.571 --> 00:13:20.571
Reverse discrimination is just as cowardly as discrimination.

211
00:13:21.502 --> 00:13:23.742
You're such a good person.

212
00:13:24.911 --> 00:13:28.811
This loser will continue being a coward.

213
00:13:36.791 --> 00:13:39.291
Please pick up, Joon Hee.

214
00:13:42.661 --> 00:13:43.791
You can't reach him?

215
00:13:46.815 --> 00:13:51.815

217

If I throw several at once,

218
00:13:59.472 --> 00:14:01.142
one of them has to hit.

219
00:14:01.142 --> 00:14:03.081
Darn it.

220
00:14:04.882 --> 00:14:06.081
Shoot.

221
00:14:14.591 --> 00:14:15.892
The air is so nice.

222
00:14:18.532 --> 00:14:20.232
You're both insane.

223
00:14:21.362 --> 00:14:23.331
Wasn't dumping the blame on In Ho bad enough for you?

224
00:14:23.872 --> 00:14:25.272
Were you planning to kill me too?

225
00:14:25.272 --> 00:14:29.002
That's not it. We were desperate. This was the only way to stop you.

226
00:14:29.472 --> 00:14:32.512
I'll tell the truth that In Ho didn't kill Mi Jung.

227
00:14:32.512 --> 00:14:35.142
No. We don't know. I really don't know!

228
00:14:36.782 --> 00:14:38.211
What if he did do it?

229
00:14:38.211 --> 00:14:41.222
What if he's the one trying to frame us for what he did?

230
00:14:41.222 --> 00:14:43.191
That's why I want to find out the truth!

231
00:14:43.191 --> 00:14:45.821
Stop making me repeat myself! What about us then?

232
00:14:46.461 --> 00:14:47.691
Still, this is wrong.

233
00:14:48.461 --> 00:14:50.032
Then what?

234
00:14:50.032 --> 00:14:53.362
One mistake like this was enough.

235
00:14:55.102 --> 00:14:56.972
I don't want to do it again.

236
00:14:59.301 --> 00:15:00.301
Hey...

237
00:15:04.571 --> 00:15:06.482
Did you have a good talk with Tae Suk?

238
00:15:07.142 --> 00:15:08.311
Give me my keys.

239
00:15:09.081 --> 00:15:11.311
What? What do you want to do?

240
00:15:12.612 --> 00:15:14.022
Give me the car keys.

241
00:15:19.252 --> 00:15:20.591
Bum. Take his keys.

242
00:15:22.321 --> 00:15:24.632
What? Your talk didn't go well?

243
00:15:24.632 --> 00:15:25.762
Let go!

244
00:15:28.032 --> 00:15:30.502
What are you doing? Take his keys!

245
00:15:30.502 --> 00:15:32.002
Shoot!

246
00:15:34.841 --> 00:15:37.012
Get over here. Come on. Let's talk.

247
00:15:37.012 --> 00:15:39.341
- Let go! - Get over here!

248
00:15:39.742 --> 00:15:41.711
Stay still, will you?

249
00:15:41.711 --> 00:15:43.512
- Let go! - Hey!

250
00:15:43.512 --> 00:15:44.752
- Come on. - Enough.

251
00:15:44.752 --> 00:15:46.252
Just take his keys!

252
00:15:46.921 --> 00:15:48.622
Help me out!

253
00:15:48.622 --> 00:15:50.722
I only told you to just take his keys!

254
00:15:50.722 --> 00:15:52.722
- What's wrong with you? - Hey, Joon Hee. Hey.

255
00:15:53.191 --> 00:15:54.262
- Hey. - Hey.

256
00:15:55.421 --> 00:15:57.291
- Gosh. Stay still. - You jerk!

257
00:15:58.862 --> 00:16:00.862
- Shoot! - Hey.

258
00:16:01.502 --> 00:16:02.532
Hey.

259
00:16:07.301 --> 00:16:08.372
Hey.

260
00:16:11.642 --> 00:16:12.742
You crazy jerk.

261
00:16:15.711 --> 00:16:16.752
Hey!

262
00:16:20.652 --> 00:16:21.782
Shoot.

263
00:16:26.191 --> 00:16:28.321
Have you lost your mind?

264
00:16:45.671 --> 00:16:46.941
This jerk...

265
00:16:58.492 --> 00:16:59.591
Joon Hee.

266
00:17:01.862 --> 00:17:03.061
Joon Hee!

267
00:17:05.061 --> 00:17:06.131
Forget it.

268
00:17:07.601 --> 00:17:09.101
I don't think anyone's home.

269
00:17:09.462 --> 00:17:12.101
We've been at it for almost 40 minutes now.

270
00:17:12.301 --> 00:17:13.841
I don't hear anything.

271
00:17:17.512 --> 00:17:20.581
I don't know what's going on. After he called...

272
00:17:23.551 --> 00:17:25.881
I can't understand what's going on.

273
00:17:35.262 --> 00:17:36.331
Is Joon Hee...

274
00:17:38.732 --> 00:17:40.061
really dead?

275
00:17:40.962 --> 00:17:42.561
Just stay still.

276
00:17:43.371 --> 00:17:47.041
I told you to control your temper, didn't I?

277
00:17:50.442 --> 00:17:52.541
Do something about it.

278
00:17:52.942 --> 00:17:55.442
Whatever. You clean up your own mess...

279
00:17:56.081 --> 00:17:57.212
from now on.

280
00:18:03.522 --> 00:18:04.621
Am I the only one who will go down then?

281
00:18:16.672 --> 00:18:20.172
Come on, Tae Suk.

282
00:18:20.601 --> 00:18:24.212
Come on, you punk. You're smart, aren't you?

283
00:18:24.571 --> 00:18:28.212
Hurry. Hurry up, and do something.

284
00:18:28.212 --> 00:18:29.982
I'm really...

285
00:18:30.351 --> 00:18:33.551
Do something about him.

286
00:18:34.752 --> 00:18:35.821
Let's abandon him.

287
00:18:52.002 --> 00:18:54.301
Where are we going?

288
00:18:54.472 --> 00:18:56.272
Shut it, and just follow me.

289
00:18:56.541 --> 00:18:59.172
I'm following because you said so,

290
00:18:59.172 --> 00:19:01.111
but can't you just tell me what your plan is first?

291
00:19:01.841 --> 00:19:04.051
I'm scared, Tae Suk.

292
00:19:04.051 --> 00:19:06.381
Hey, this is your mess. Stop whining.

293
00:19:07.252 --> 00:19:09.551
Okay. I got it.

294
00:19:10.192 --> 00:19:13.462
I'll just do as you say.

295
00:19:13.462 --> 00:19:15.662
We'll go to a place without any surveillance cameras.

296
00:19:15.692 --> 00:19:17.631
So keep your distance, and follow me.

297
00:19:17.932 --> 00:19:20.702
Shoot. I heard it's going to rain soon.

298
00:19:20.932 --> 00:19:22.101
Consider yourself lucky.

299
00:19:22.202 --> 00:19:24.871
How could raining be lucky for me?

300
00:19:25.032 --> 00:19:27.071
I'm scared to death.

301
00:19:27.401 --> 00:19:29.141
I was a fool trying to talk to you.

302
00:19:29.742 --> 00:19:30.742
Forget it. Bye.

303
00:19:31.712 --> 00:19:33.041
You're distracting me from driving.

304
00:19:35.141 --> 00:19:36.912
His body in the back scares me enough already.

305
00:20:20.992 --> 00:20:21.992
Joon Hee.

306
00:20:24.861 --> 00:20:26.432
Joon... Joon Hee, can you hear me?

307
00:20:37.972 --> 00:20:38.972
Bum.

308
00:20:38.972 --> 00:20:43.182
I'm following you. Stop worrying about me.

309
00:20:43.512 --> 00:20:44.512
Right now,

310
00:20:45.611 --> 00:20:47.522
- Joon Hee... - What about him?

311
00:20:49.252 --> 00:20:50.291
Joon Hee...

312
00:20:54.621 --> 00:20:56.121
You're both insane.

313
00:20:56.631 --> 00:20:58.591
Wasn't dumping the blame on In Ho bad enough for you?

314
00:20:58.962 --> 00:21:00.502
Were you planning to kill me too?

315
00:21:00.502 --> 00:21:04.202
That's not it. We were desperate. This was the only way to stop you.

316
00:21:04.502 --> 00:21:07.541
I'll tell the truth that In Ho didn't kill Mi Jung.

317
00:21:12.841 --> 00:21:14.682
What about Joon Hee?

318
00:21:15.412 --> 00:21:17.311
Joon Hee had been going through a lot for all this time.

319
00:21:18.412 --> 00:21:19.982
Maybe it might be better this way.

320
00:21:29.992 --> 00:21:31.192
My gosh.

321
00:21:36.702 --> 00:21:41.871
You're right. It's true that the law is tolerant toward money and power.

322
00:21:42.972 --> 00:21:45.571
Nonetheless, a police officer...

323
00:21:45.571 --> 00:21:48.311
must treat everyone equally.

324
00:21:48.682 --> 00:21:51.811
Reverse discrimination is just as cowardly as discrimination.

325
00:22:00.821 --> 00:22:04.361
Anyway, Joon Hee said he'd clear my husband's name,

326
00:22:04.361 --> 00:22:06.601
and that he was in front of the police station.

327
00:22:06.601 --> 00:22:09.101
Oh, that? A crazy jerk caused a car accident...

328
00:22:09.101 --> 00:22:10.901
and fled after leaving behind the vehicle.

329
00:22:19.212 --> 00:22:22.141
- Is it ready? - Gosh, do you know what time it is?

330
00:22:22.141 --> 00:22:23.881
I'm sorry. This case is urgent.

331
00:22:24.581 --> 00:22:26.682
You wanted to check the CCTVs in front of the precinct, right?

332
00:22:26.682 --> 00:22:28.121
It was about 10:30am.

333
00:22:31.692 --> 00:22:33.091
(For visiting police officers)

334
00:22:50.472 --> 00:22:53.442
Why didn't you answer your phone if you were at home?

335
00:22:53.512 --> 00:22:56.141
I should be asking that question. What brings you here at this hour?

336
00:22:57.512 --> 00:22:59.821
I called you to check a few things, but you didn't answer.

337
00:23:02.151 --> 00:23:05.391
I tried to enlarge the photo, but the face is blurry.

338
00:23:09.522 --> 00:23:12.232
This is Joon Hee. It's his car too.

339
00:23:13.331 --> 00:23:15.002
What... What happened?

340
00:23:15.032 --> 00:23:17.272
There has been an accident in front of the precinct.

341
00:23:17.601 --> 00:23:20.202
Seo Joon Hee tried to make a U-turn to drive into the precinct.

342
00:23:20.401 --> 00:23:22.841
That guy in the photo crashed into the vehicle on purpose.

343
00:23:23.442 --> 00:23:26.282
As you can see, the guy who took Seo Joon Hee...

344
00:23:26.282 --> 00:23:28.141
was wearing a hat and a mask to conceal his face,

345
00:23:28.141 --> 00:23:29.482
so I couldn't identify him.

346
00:23:30.712 --> 00:23:32.752
He prepared himself for the CCTVs.

347
00:24:17.232 --> 00:24:19.702
Tae Suk. Tae Suk.

348
00:24:23.401 --> 00:24:26.541
I... I can't move my body.

349
00:24:27.942 --> 00:24:29.101
Where am I?

350
00:24:30.472 --> 00:24:33.141
Hey, Joon Hee. We are...

351
00:24:38.712 --> 00:24:40.482
We are going home.

352
00:24:47.022 --> 00:24:49.192
Please endure the pain for a bit.

353
00:24:50.432 --> 00:24:53.131
But why are you crying?

354
00:24:54.732 --> 00:24:56.401
Joon Hee.

355
00:24:58.772 --> 00:25:00.341
I'm sorry.

356
00:25:16.992 --> 00:25:17.992
Shoot.

357
00:25:27.032 --> 00:25:29.831
Tae Suk, please give me your jacket.

358
00:25:30.032 --> 00:25:32.002
I feel so cold.

359
00:25:37.871 --> 00:25:41.482
Okay, Joon Hee. It will be short.

360
00:25:42.041 --> 00:25:43.381
You will feel better soon.

361
00:26:08.401 --> 00:26:09.401
Tae Suk.

362
00:26:13.081 --> 00:26:15.012
Are you sure there isn't any way for you to identify the man?

363
00:26:16.311 --> 00:26:19.651
The vehicle the man drove is an untraceable vehicle. I doubt it.

364
00:26:23.952 --> 00:26:25.391
Who could have taken him?

365
00:26:26.621 --> 00:26:28.121
What are you going to do now?

366
00:26:34.601 --> 00:26:35.601
Let's push them off.

367
00:26:37.371 --> 00:26:38.401
Off the cliff.

368
00:26:38.772 --> 00:26:40.071
You want to push Joon Hee and the car...

369
00:26:48.782 --> 00:26:50.611
Are you saying we should push them off the cliff?

370
00:26:50.752 --> 00:26:51.952
What else can we do?

371
00:27:00.121 --> 00:27:01.121
We don't have time.

372
00:27:02.022 --> 00:27:03.032
Do it now.

373
00:27:14.002 --> 00:27:15.002
If I start having second thoughts,

374
00:27:16.041 --> 00:27:17.311
I could go to the police.

375
00:27:19.472 --> 00:27:20.611
Move it!

376
00:27:30.722 --> 00:27:31.722
Tae Suk.

377
00:27:37.462 --> 00:27:38.462
Tae Suk.

378
00:27:38.662 --> 00:27:39.762
Push it!

379
00:27:42.202 --> 00:27:43.202
How...

380
00:27:45.401 --> 00:27:47.101
Tae Suk, I can't do this.

381
00:27:49.611 --> 00:27:50.611
Tae Suk.

382
00:27:54.341 --> 00:27:55.341
Push!

383
00:28:02.222 --> 00:28:03.651
- I'm so sorry. - Joon Hee!

384
00:28:04.752 --> 00:28:05.752
I'm so sorry.

385
00:28:06.692 --> 00:28:08.391
If everything you told me is true,

386
00:28:08.821 --> 00:28:11.732
you must find Mr. Seo Joon Hee to clear Mr. Kang's name.

387
00:28:16.871 --> 00:28:17.901
Push!

388
00:29:07.621 --> 00:29:09.482
(Return)

389
00:29:10.091 --> 00:29:12.051
We can't undo what's already been done.

390
00:29:12.051 --> 00:29:13.222
Let's create an alibi.

391
00:29:13.561 --> 00:29:15.422
I won't lose you guys this time.

392
00:29:16.432 --> 00:29:18.962
I'll uncover everything you jerks did.
