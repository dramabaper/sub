00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.610
I'm so scared.

2
00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:08.870
Open the door!

3
00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:10.380
- I'm scared. - Don't be scared!

4
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.950
Aji 3, we'll protect you.

5
00:00:20.221 --> 00:00:22.620
Don't open the door! Stay inside!

6
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.560
- Hands up! - Hands in the air!

7
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.130
Take them!

8
00:00:39.501 --> 00:00:40.541
Put your hands behind your back.

10
00:00:59.461 --> 00:01:01.291
Aji 3, are you okay?

11
00:01:02.461 --> 00:01:03.660
Let's go home.

12
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:10.801
Search the place thoroughly.

13
00:01:10.801 --> 00:01:12.901
- Yes, sir. - Search the stairs too.

14
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.271
Search the stairs, and block the hallway.

15
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.911
- Keep searching. - Yes, sir.

16
00:01:22.181 --> 00:01:23.250
Uncle.

17
00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.080
Do you think...

18
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.351
Aji 3 will remember me?

19
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.730
She's a robot, so she'll remember you forever.

20
00:01:35.691 --> 00:01:38.261
I'm happy.

21
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.441
We should get new shoes for you, Aji 3.

22
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.450
I met a lot of people.

23
00:01:55.551 --> 00:01:58.051
I want to read the emotions of many more people.

24
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.851
She must've enjoyed the outside world she's seen for the first time.

25
00:02:01.791 --> 00:02:04.060
Aji 3, keep a backup of today's file.

26
00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:06.060
Backup is complete.

27
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.661
Aji 3, are you happy to be back home?

28
00:02:09.661 --> 00:02:11.131
I need to be charged.

29
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.871
Yes. Let's take some rest.

30
00:02:13.871 --> 00:02:16.101
We should take some rest too.

31
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.270
I've completely burned myself out.

32
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.811
Doctor Hong.

33
00:02:21.441 --> 00:02:23.710
We should still run a test and check if she's fine.

34
00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:25.511
Aji 3.

35
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.011
What's the safest seat on a trip to Busan?

36
00:02:29.281 --> 00:02:30.321
- Seat Ma Dong Seok. - Seat Ma Dong Seok.

37
00:02:32.821 --> 00:02:35.351
Everything's perfect. I feel so accomplished.

38
00:02:57.841 --> 00:02:59.140
What are you thinking about?

39
00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.980
It's a secret.

40
00:03:04.221 --> 00:03:05.980
Hey, are you serious?

41
00:03:09.121 --> 00:03:10.191
I'm just happy.

42
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:11.960
Why?

43
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.031
I'm just happy...

44
00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.700
with everything that's going on right now.

45
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.670
I achieved my goal for today,

46
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.700
and...

47
00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.811
you're beside me right now.

48
00:03:32.511 --> 00:03:33.650
And...

49
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.980
I can lie down and look at you like this.

50
00:03:39.221 --> 00:03:41.091
Hey, you're heavy.

51
00:03:41.091 --> 00:03:42.920
Well, just bear with it.

52
00:03:45.121 --> 00:03:46.221
By the way,

53
00:03:47.031 --> 00:03:48.490
you're a really good driver.

54
00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:52.700
See? I told you. I told you that you should be honored.

55
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.871
Tell me if you need anything else.

56
00:03:56.971 --> 00:03:58.441
Do whatever you want.

57
00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:00.610
Make what you want to make.

58
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.371
Instead, I want to be the first one to see it.

59
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.150
You're still not safe to go outside by yourself, so I'll...

60
00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:13.751
Stop right there.

61
00:04:21.731 --> 00:04:23.191
- I need to go now. - What?

62
00:04:23.861 --> 00:04:25.160
You can spend time with her.

63
00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.931
- Where are you going to go? - I need to go home.

64
00:04:29.431 --> 00:04:30.540
Why can't you stay here?

65
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.700
This is your place.

66
00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.710
Can't it be your place as well?

67
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.111
What are you talking about?

68
00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.981
I'm hungry. Cook for me.

69
00:04:42.181 --> 00:04:43.650
Cook your own food.

70
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.921
Come on. I have no energy.

71
00:04:47.191 --> 00:04:49.150
Come on. Cook for me.

72
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.460
Make me something.

73
00:04:51.921 --> 00:04:53.520
Go and cook something yourself.

74
00:04:54.691 --> 00:04:55.731
Come on. I want food.

75
00:04:55.731 --> 00:04:58.030
- Okay, okay. Get up. - Okay.

76
00:05:06.671 --> 00:05:09.270
Back when I was young, I went on a field trip.

77
00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.981
But there was no one to make gimbap for me, so I had to make my own.

78
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.481
My aunt went on a field trip for the first time when she was my age.

79
00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.520
But she didn't know how to make gimbap.

80
00:05:20.751 --> 00:05:23.960
So she made rice balls instead.

81
00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.790
That was the first time she ever made these.

82
00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.431
Why would a kid have to make her own gimbap?

83
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.431
Because there was no one there to make them for her.

84
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.400
Your aunt...

85
00:05:36.171 --> 00:05:39.501
must've gotten teased by her friends on that field trip.

86
00:05:39.671 --> 00:05:41.770
Apparently, no one ate with her.

87
00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.241
But my mom did.

88
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.481
That's why my aunt became a guardian angel for my mom.

89
00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:52.621
Here. Try it.

90
00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:57.460
Why are you laughing?

91
00:05:58.421 --> 00:05:59.460
It's a secret.

92
00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.231
Why is it a secret? Then I'm not going to give you this.

93
00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:03.561
I just found out...

94
00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.270
who my guardian angel was.

95
00:06:08.571 --> 00:06:09.631
Who was it?

96
00:06:59.551 --> 00:07:02.421
You told Yoo Cheol everything?

97
00:07:04.321 --> 00:07:05.421
I guess he was...

98
00:07:06.191 --> 00:07:07.561
bound to find out sooner or later.

99
00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.801
You didn't tell him about the other stuff, did you?

100
00:07:12.001 --> 00:07:14.400
No, I didn't tell him.

101
00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.801
Martin already got away.

102
00:07:17.501 --> 00:07:19.840
I just need to get the charges dropped.

103
00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:22.811
Make sure to get Director Ye.

104
00:07:23.681 --> 00:07:24.741
Go back.

105
00:07:25.241 --> 00:07:27.611
I will not become in-laws with a criminal.

106
00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.491
This is a gift from Chairman Hwang.

107
00:07:42.061 --> 00:07:46.631
The shares in his borrowed name accounts were transferred to Ri El.

108
00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:48.371
Chairman Hwang...

109
00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:51.840
wants you to become the new director.

110
00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:53.941
If you accept,

111
00:07:53.941 --> 00:07:56.171
he will support you wholeheartedly.

112
00:07:57.611 --> 00:08:01.350
He wants me to become director and cover up all his shortcomings?

113
00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:04.981
That would make it easier for you to do your duties...

114
00:08:04.981 --> 00:08:06.821
once you become a director.

115
00:08:06.991 --> 00:08:09.850
You just have to oust Director Kim.

116
00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:11.890
Ousting him isn't enough.

117
00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.330
He will come back.

118
00:08:16.731 --> 00:08:19.301
We must make sure he loses the will to come back.

119
00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.231
Will you use his illness?

120
00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.280
Hold on.

121
00:08:45.361 --> 00:08:47.231
I know what you're thinking.

122
00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.201
But one's misfortune sometimes becomes...

123
00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.231
another person's opportunity.

124
00:08:53.601 --> 00:08:57.670
What you need at a time like that is the courage to go with it.

125
00:09:02.741 --> 00:09:03.841
How...

126
00:09:07.511 --> 00:09:09.251
How is that courage?

127
00:09:09.251 --> 00:09:12.621
It's courage. Not anyone can do it.

128
00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:15.951
You can't say that, Dad.

129
00:09:16.721 --> 00:09:18.621
It doesn't make sense.

130
00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.831
I'm your daughter.

131
00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:25.900
Do you think I'll be happy?

132
00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:27.701
Everything passes.

133
00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.140
When it does, you'll see it was nothing.

134
00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:42.011
Your father looked over his crime,

135
00:09:42.011 --> 00:09:43.650
in return for the rebate.

136
00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:45.081
Okay.

137
00:09:47.591 --> 00:09:51.491
He didn't kill anyone.

138
00:09:58.501 --> 00:09:59.501
Hi.

139
00:09:59.501 --> 00:10:02.371
Does Min Kyu have an illness?

140
00:10:03.131 --> 00:10:05.001
I think your dad and mine...

141
00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:08.211
will use that to do something terrible.

142
00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:10.640
- What? - I called thinking...

143
00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.410
you wouldn't know about this.

144
00:10:14.111 --> 00:10:15.810
You don't know about it, do you?

145
00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:18.881
No, I...

146
00:10:20.351 --> 00:10:21.951
I'll call you right back.

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:52.810
Can you straighten this out too?

151
00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:54.011
Of course.

153
00:12:33.121 --> 00:12:36.721
When asking questions during a tarot card reading,

154
00:12:36.721 --> 00:12:39.591
it's best to be specific, not general.

155
00:12:39.591 --> 00:12:43.190
For example, rather than, "Can I fall in love,"

156
00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:46.300
you say, "Can I fall in love with this person?"

157
00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:49.471
The answer to that question would be...

158
00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:52.300
The Lover.

159
00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:55.410
It's yours.

160
00:13:08.351 --> 00:13:10.761
Would you mind if I join in?

161
00:13:11.091 --> 00:13:13.861
I'm right here. Respect my existence.

162
00:13:14.131 --> 00:13:17.201
Do you want me to buy you a pair of Heart Balls?

163
00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:19.400
I shouldn't have fallen asleep then.

164
00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:21.201
I didn't know this would happen.

165
00:13:21.871 --> 00:13:23.001
The Lover.

166
00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:25.570
I feel lonely.

167
00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:29.910
I feel lonely now. So lonely.

00:13:33.611 --> 00:13:35.611
I told you she'd be pretty.

170
00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:38.520
Who is she? Do you know her?

171
00:13:40.121 --> 00:13:43.790
Your hair, your style. Wow.

172
00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:45.091
You know her too?

173
00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:46.890
Hello.

174
00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:50.631
People die if they make a drastic change.

175
00:13:51.461 --> 00:13:52.530
(Vegetable juice)

176
00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:54.231
Drink these and wake up.

177
00:13:54.231 --> 00:13:57.400
The style changed but not the character. Good.

178
00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:00.371
I'm in a bad mood. Shall I dye my hair ash blue?

179
00:14:00.371 --> 00:14:02.810
Do it. It's not bad.

180
00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:04.981
Hoktal, what do you say? Do you want to do it with me?

181
00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:11.020
I'm not the hair dye type.

182
00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:13.851
Up until yesterday, you'd do anything I asked.

183
00:14:13.851 --> 00:14:15.790
Why the sudden change?

184
00:14:15.951 --> 00:14:18.160
Did Sun Hye tell you not to do it?

185
00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:21.290
She shrugged. That's despicable.

186
00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:23.660
- Hoktal. - Yes?

187
00:14:24.101 --> 00:14:27.070
Go back to the time when you were nice to me.

188
00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:29.930
I feel so lonely on days like this.

189
00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:31.400
Why? Is today a special day?

190
00:14:32.001 --> 00:14:34.940
No, it's just...

191
00:14:35.741 --> 00:14:37.410
Fine, don't do anything.

192
00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:39.310
I'll just get angry if you do something.

193
00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:43.780
Don't do anything.

194
00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:45.751
- Hello. - Hi.

195
00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:48.121
- You bought juice. - Yes.

196
00:14:52.261 --> 00:14:55.491
- Gosh, it's good. - Yes.

197
00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:57.701
Something needs fixing.

198
00:14:57.701 --> 00:14:59.601
Okay.

199
00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:04.940
What? Is your scalp itchy?

200
00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:06.101
No, no.

201
00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:09.810
You're made for each other.

202
00:15:11.241 --> 00:15:13.810
Ssanip, I need you to go to Yongsan.

203
00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:15.381
What? Where?

204
00:15:15.381 --> 00:15:18.520
Buy these, and come straight to the outhouse.

205
00:15:19.481 --> 00:15:22.451
Oh, parts, Yongsan? Okay, Doctor.

206
00:15:23.251 --> 00:15:24.420
See you.

207
00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:28.331
- Take your time. - I love you.

208
00:15:28.331 --> 00:15:30.131
- Me too. - Bye.

209
00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:38.101
Pai, by the way,

210
00:15:39.341 --> 00:15:42.841
you look a bit... Strange.

211
00:15:43.111 --> 00:15:44.140
How so?

212
00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:46.780
You don't look like you used to.

213
00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:48.351
The difference is...

214
00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:52.251
Oh, your eyes are bigger.

215
00:15:52.251 --> 00:15:54.251
I'm not wearing glasses.

216
00:15:54.751 --> 00:15:55.851
I see.

217
00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:00.690
Your forehead's wider too.

218
00:16:01.331 --> 00:16:03.160
I parted my bangs.

219
00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:05.501
I see.

220
00:16:09.231 --> 00:16:11.341
You parted your bangs.

221
00:16:12.101 --> 00:16:15.540
Wait, your hair. Wasn't your hair curly?

222
00:16:15.841 --> 00:16:17.640
I got sick of it, so I straightened it.

223
00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:23.111
Does my hair look weird?

224
00:16:23.381 --> 00:16:24.420
No.

225
00:16:25.221 --> 00:16:26.351
It doesn't.

226
00:16:29.751 --> 00:16:30.820
Let's go.

227
00:16:35.131 --> 00:16:36.761
It doesn't look weird.

228
00:16:39.001 --> 00:16:40.871
Even without Ji A next to me,

229
00:16:40.871 --> 00:16:42.831
I keep practicing going out on my own.

230
00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:46.741
Right. I guess she can't be around you all the time.

231
00:16:46.741 --> 00:16:48.241
She's no longer a robot.

232
00:16:48.471 --> 00:16:49.670
Exactly.

233
00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:52.910
I liked that about her when she was a robot.

234
00:16:53.981 --> 00:16:55.180
Aren't you afraid?

235
00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:59.020
I keep telling myself that she's next to me,

236
00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:02.121
and that seems to help a bit.

237
00:17:02.491 --> 00:17:04.860
Your index seems to be okay right now.

238
00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:07.090
As long as you avoid a situation...

239
00:17:07.090 --> 00:17:09.130
where you suddenly face a crowd,

240
00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:12.030
don't you think you can handle everyday life?

241
00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.671
Would that ever happen?

242
00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:17.540
Take care. Goodbye.

243
00:17:20.201 --> 00:17:21.610
(Emergency board meeting tomorrow.)

244
00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:22.870
(Dismissal of Director Kim Min Kyu.)

245
00:17:30.721 --> 00:17:32.350
I'm back.

246
00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:36.421
Doctor.

247
00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:38.320
Hoktal.

248
00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:42.560
Brother?

249
00:17:44.261 --> 00:17:47.130
I'm not scared. I'm not scared at all.

250
00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:48.701
Doctor.

251
00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:53.971
Where did everyone go without me?

252
00:17:55.171 --> 00:17:58.481
They're all so mean. How could they?

253
00:17:58.481 --> 00:18:01.810
It's my birthday. If I were in the US, there'd be a party.

254
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:04.120
No one cares.

255
00:18:05.251 --> 00:18:08.020
- Hello. - What the... What's going on?

256
00:18:08.151 --> 00:18:09.651
Happy birthday.

257
00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:15.491
Happy birthday to you

258
00:18:15.491 --> 00:18:18.530
Happy birthday to you

259
00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:21.870
Happy birthday dear Ssanip

260
00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:24.671
Happy birthday to you

261
00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:35.880
You're all so childish.

262
00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:38.120
A surprise party?

263
00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:41.020
We don't do this on the east coast.

264
00:18:41.421 --> 00:18:44.391
Things like this don't impress me.

265
00:18:45.461 --> 00:18:46.590
I'm impressed.

266
00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.330
Thank you.

267
00:18:50.161 --> 00:18:51.860
Did you think we didn't know?

268
00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:54.001
- Blow out the candles. - Blow the candles.

269
00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:55.600
Blow the candles.

270
00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.001
Let's all live together.

271
00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:13.951
Brother, this is incredible. Did you make it?

272
00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:18.120
I knew it. I just put together a little feast.

273
00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:19.590
The cake's amazing.

274
00:19:20.991 --> 00:19:22.461
I chose it.

275
00:19:22.931 --> 00:19:24.330
With my help.

276
00:19:28.501 --> 00:19:30.641
I feel like overturning the table.

277
00:19:30.741 --> 00:19:31.770
Here's yours.

278
00:19:38.681 --> 00:19:39.711
Your present.

279
00:19:41.511 --> 00:19:43.350
What could be inside?

280
00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:46.050
What is it?

281
00:19:47.451 --> 00:19:48.790
(Citron bread)

282
00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:49.850
Citron bread?

283
00:19:51.721 --> 00:19:53.731
Brother, what does this mean?

284
00:19:53.731 --> 00:19:56.431
We heard you cry whenever you see this.

285
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:58.060
I wanted to see you eat it and cry.

286
00:19:58.100 --> 00:19:59.800
Why you...

287
00:20:01.971 --> 00:20:04.401
- You're crying already. - What are you saying?

288
00:20:04.401 --> 00:20:05.701
I see tears.

289
00:20:05.701 --> 00:20:07.511
He's crying, he's crying.

290
00:20:10.741 --> 00:20:13.981
Shall I make him cry even more?

291
00:20:14.481 --> 00:20:15.550
With this gift.

292
00:20:15.681 --> 00:20:19.020
Is that a new one? How many terabytes?

293
00:20:19.251 --> 00:20:21.451
The present is the video on this.

294
00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:23.820
It's a gift from Aji 3 who just finished...

295
00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:25.820
her first outing.

296
00:20:44.481 --> 00:20:46.580
She must be really cold.

297
00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:50.280
What's she wearing? It's so thin.

298
00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:53.221
Don't wander around, and go straight home.

299
00:20:54.391 --> 00:20:55.951
Or you will end up like me.

300
00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:59.520
What does it mean to end up like you?

301
00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:04.100
I have no one to see.

302
00:21:06.231 --> 00:21:08.201
There is no one waiting for me.

303
00:21:10.231 --> 00:21:12.471
No one is interested in me.

304
00:21:17.181 --> 00:21:20.080
You know how to take the bus, right? Get going.

305
00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:31.491
You did a good job.

306
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:45.770
Thank you.

307
00:21:50.911 --> 00:21:51.981
You're pretty.

308
00:21:53.911 --> 00:21:54.951
Aji 3.

309
00:21:57.050 --> 00:21:59.251
Aji 3, where are you going?

310
00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:04.820
Aji 3, are you okay?

311
00:22:05.891 --> 00:22:06.991
Let's go home.

312
00:22:25.941 --> 00:22:29.181
We wanted Aji 3 to commune with people.

313
00:22:30.481 --> 00:22:31.550
As you saw,

314
00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:35.820
she did much better than we had hoped.

315
00:22:36.891 --> 00:22:37.961
Not just us.

316
00:22:38.721 --> 00:22:42.761
Min Kyu and Ji A, you both did well too.

317
00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:46.401
Why do we make robots?

318
00:22:47.201 --> 00:22:48.931
I think that Aji 3's memories...

319
00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:51.570
will answer that.

320
00:22:52.401 --> 00:22:53.540
It's heartbreaking,

321
00:22:54.711 --> 00:22:56.711
but as promised, I think it's time...

322
00:22:57.540 --> 00:22:58.880
to change Aji 3's face.

323
00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:03.481
We'll leave just the patterns of the emotions she procured,

324
00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:07.550
and delete every video including the private ones...

325
00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:10.691
she took of Min Kyu and Ji A.

326
00:23:12.961 --> 00:23:13.961
Then...

327
00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:16.290
we'll begin on...

328
00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:18.560
our new android robot.

329
00:23:19.901 --> 00:23:21.130
I'm sure that Aji 3...

330
00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:24.270
would want that too.

331
00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:28.641
She'd want us to make her memories more beautiful.

332
00:23:29.911 --> 00:23:30.911
So...

333
00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:33.141
let's all...

334
00:23:35.951 --> 00:23:37.020
say our goodbyes.

335
00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:43.891
You helped us come this far.

336
00:23:45.191 --> 00:23:46.590
The patterns you left...

337
00:23:47.231 --> 00:23:48.860
will continue in the next robot.

338
00:23:49.391 --> 00:23:50.401
That's how...

339
00:23:51.231 --> 00:23:52.761
we'll remember you forever.

340
00:23:54.701 --> 00:23:56.870
Bye, Aji 3.

341
00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:00.141
I'm really sorry for sending you...

342
00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:02.641
to Martin.

343
00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.911
I really wanted to say that.

344
00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:10.880
I'll tell the next robot about you.

345
00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:13.421
You...

346
00:24:14.951 --> 00:24:16.350
will not disappear.

347
00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:20.491
I know you liked me more than anyone.

348
00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:22.931
I will remember you,

349
00:24:24.401 --> 00:24:25.461
Aji 3.

350
00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:30.130
- Goodbye, Aji 3. - Goodbye, Aji 3.

351
00:24:38.511 --> 00:24:40.481
Aji 3's last video...

352
00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:44.020
captured Martin confessing to killing Chairman Park.

353
00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:48.691
I think he let his guard down because she was a robot.

354
00:24:50.491 --> 00:24:52.590
Interpol will love this.

355
00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:55.630
They will protect Jang Doo Sam for sure now.

356
00:24:57.630 --> 00:24:58.661
That's good.

357
00:24:59.731 --> 00:25:02.231
We have reporters on standby.

358
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:03.941
We can go right ahead.

359
00:25:04.241 --> 00:25:05.701
When the board meeting ends,

360
00:25:06.141 --> 00:25:10.280
someone is bound to tell them what just happened.

361
00:25:11.441 --> 00:25:13.651
We can't get blood on our hands.

362
00:25:24.761 --> 00:25:25.921
(Emergency Board Meeting)

363
00:25:25.921 --> 00:25:28.731
We shall begin the emergency board meeting.

364
00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:31.701
The agenda is the dismissal of Director Kim Min Kyu.

365
00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:35.731
The cause is as you were all informed. An illness.

366
00:25:57.661 --> 00:25:58.661
He's here.

367
00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:10.171
(KM Financial Director Kim Min Kyu Press Conference)

368
00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:18.681
(KM Financial Director Kim Min Kyu Press Conference)

369
00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:24.721
I'm KM Financial's director...

370
00:26:26.151 --> 00:26:27.151
Kim Min Kyu.

371
00:26:29.251 --> 00:26:30.421
I also...

372
00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:39.731
suffer from...

373
00:26:43.201 --> 00:26:44.270
a human allergy.

374
00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:22.070
(I'm Not a Robot)

375
00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:23.780
His allergy isn't completely cured yet?

376
00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:26.011
Is he allowed to go outside without you?

377
00:27:26.011 --> 00:27:28.681
It's not over yet. We still have a chance.

378
00:27:28.681 --> 00:27:31.520
Why is he always so harsh on me?

379
00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:35.221
We used to be friends. How could he treat me this way?

380
00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:38.661
Don't you need me there to fight?

381
00:27:38.661 --> 00:27:40.060
No, it's okay.

382
00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:43.830
Wherever I may be, I know that you'll always be by my side.

383
00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:47.330
I think it's going to be okay this time.
