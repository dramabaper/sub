5
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.710
Please have a seat.

6
00:00:39.101 --> 00:00:40.900
As all of you know...

7
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.582
Baek Gyu Sang and
Baek Gyung Seo's transplant...

8
00:00:44.582 --> 00:00:46.441
fell through.

9
00:00:46.441 --> 00:00:48.582
Is an inconsistent liver
transplant not possible?

10
00:00:48.582 --> 00:00:50.825
It's impossible, considering
Baek Gyung Seo's current condition.

11
00:00:50.825 --> 00:00:54.096
Then, are you suggesting that we wait
until she's chosen from the waiting list

12
00:00:54.096 --> 00:00:55.747
when she's in such critical condition?

13
00:00:55.747 --> 00:00:58.497
No, we have to find one.

14
00:00:58.497 --> 00:01:00.188
How?

15
00:01:02.912 --> 00:01:04.650
An donor exchange transplant.
(Paired donor exchange.)

16
00:01:12.067 --> 00:01:16.492
An donor exchange transplant is
impossible with our hospital's manpower.

17
00:01:16.492 --> 00:01:17.900
No, it's possible.

18
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.034
In order to operate
on four patients at once

19
00:01:20.034 --> 00:01:23.156
we need two surgeons for the extractions
and two surgeons for the transplants.

20
00:01:23.156 --> 00:01:27.009
We currently have Doctor Lee,
Doctor Hong, and myself.

21
00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:30.858
And we can bring another doctor
on board to fill the last spot.

22
00:01:31.594 --> 00:01:33.233
Who...

23
00:01:37.173 --> 00:01:38.772
It's not...

24
00:01:39.307 --> 00:01:41.108
Doctor Kang In Kyu.

25
00:01:46.018 --> 00:01:49.924
Since you saved her, you should take
full responsibility, don't you think?

26
00:01:49.924 --> 00:01:52.232
I'm not a doctor at Sunrim Hospital

27
00:01:52.232 --> 00:01:55.234
but a medical officer
at Shingwang Prison.

28
00:01:55.234 --> 00:01:58.334
That's why I'm inviting you to help us.

29
00:01:59.101 --> 00:02:00.800
I'll decline.

30
00:02:11.961 --> 00:02:15.747
Are you joking right now?
Do you want to see me lose my mind?

31
00:02:15.747 --> 00:02:18.348
You told me to convince my son.

32
00:02:18.348 --> 00:02:20.473
So I did.

33
00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:23.878
But what now?
A donor exchange transplant?

34
00:02:23.878 --> 00:02:29.578
If your son undergoes the transplant,
his remaining liver will be too small

35
00:02:29.578 --> 00:02:32.578
to undergo the transplant
with Congressman Noh.

36
00:02:33.501 --> 00:02:37.266
But the fact that you have a candidate

37
00:02:37.266 --> 00:02:39.194
for a donor exchange
transplant is a miracle.

38
00:02:39.194 --> 00:02:44.294
There are so many people who
wait to be selected for this program.

39
00:02:45.294 --> 00:02:48.094
But you said that he's a criminal.

40
00:02:48.096 --> 00:02:51.117
Did you forget who my husband is?

41
00:02:51.117 --> 00:02:55.990
He's Congressman Noh Jin Tae.
A congressman in his third term.

42
00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.197
We should be selective of which liver
to give him. How can we possibly...

43
00:03:00.824 --> 00:03:04.375
How can we possibly
give him a criminal's liver?

44
00:03:04.376 --> 00:03:07.776
We don't have a choice in the matter.

45
00:03:07.776 --> 00:03:12.175
I still won't allow it.
Find someone else.

46
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.150
Congressman Noh's condition
will continue to decline.

47
00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.150
Madam...

48
00:03:24.555 --> 00:03:26.300
Fine.

49
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.001
I'll accept that criminal's liver.

50
00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:32.200
You made the right choice.

51
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.700
But I can't give you my son's liver.

52
00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:41.713
In donor exchange transplants

53
00:03:41.713 --> 00:03:45.864
it is only valid when two families
that cannot donate to their own

54
00:03:45.864 --> 00:03:49.401
come to an agreement
and donate the organs to each other.

55
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.859
It's not valid
if it's a one-sided donation.

56
00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:59.442
I don't know. I hate complicated things,
so I don't know about you're saying.

57
00:03:59.442 --> 00:04:03.423
But tell him to donate his liver
to my husband or forget the whole thing.

58
00:04:06.086 --> 00:04:11.086
Then, may I take that as a refusal?

59
00:04:12.935 --> 00:04:17.521
There's another candidate for the
donor exchange transplant, isn't there?

60
00:04:25.101 --> 00:04:28.886
- Yes, there is.
- Then let's do it with them.

61
00:04:28.886 --> 00:04:30.432
Yes, Sir.

62
00:04:31.101 --> 00:04:34.250
Chief Director Son,
did you not understand what I just said?

63
00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.750
I understood.

64
00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.514
Then what are you doing,
instead of trying to convince the donor?

65
00:04:38.514 --> 00:04:41.863
- Do I have to do that?
- Of course.

66
00:04:41.863 --> 00:04:45.125
Whether you get him out of prison
or bribe him with money

67
00:04:45.125 --> 00:04:47.026
you should do
whatever you can to convince him.

68
00:04:47.026 --> 00:04:48.720
Why do I have to do that?

69
00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.646
- Because...
- Madam.

70
00:04:50.646 --> 00:04:52.949
I'm a businessman.

71
00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:56.860
I don't bargain with just one side.

72
00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.504
I always bargain with both sides.

73
00:05:15.115 --> 00:05:17.221
The internet is going crazy
about you right now.

74
00:05:17.221 --> 00:05:19.646
They're praising
the emergency measures you took

75
00:05:19.646 --> 00:05:22.396
and calling you a great doctor
who found her a donor.

76
00:05:22.396 --> 00:05:25.901
A lot of people are posting
compliments on the prison homepage too.

77
00:05:25.901 --> 00:05:28.874
It looks like you're saving
our prison's image, Doctor Kang.

78
00:05:28.874 --> 00:05:30.473
Not at all.

79
00:05:30.988 --> 00:05:34.689
By the way, we received
an official letter from Sunrim Hospital.

80
00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:38.564
When are you going to participate
in Baek Gyu Sang's surgery?

81
00:05:40.901 --> 00:05:44.723
They requested my help,
but I declined the offer.

82
00:05:44.723 --> 00:05:48.189
- You declined?
- Wait, why?

83
00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:52.074
I'm a doctor at Shingwang Prison,
not Sunrim Hospital.

84
00:05:52.074 --> 00:05:56.029
Hey, why do you have to draw a line
when they're asking for help?

85
00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:59.946
That's right. They even
sent an official letter.

86
00:05:59.946 --> 00:06:03.687
We have two of our prisoners
at their hospital right now.

87
00:06:03.687 --> 00:06:07.687
How can we decline, when two
of our family members are over there?

88
00:06:08.752 --> 00:06:10.745
Go help them.

89
00:06:11.851 --> 00:06:14.802
The chief really wants you to.

90
00:06:15.648 --> 00:06:19.298
That's right, Doctor Kang.
It'll look good for us too.

91
00:06:19.298 --> 00:06:21.497
A medical officer
who takes full responsibility

92
00:06:21.497 --> 00:06:23.286
for a patient he saved on the streets.

93
00:06:23.286 --> 00:06:26.701
You know we're in a difficult situation
because of Kim Hyung Bum's rampage.

94
00:06:26.701 --> 00:06:29.401
Help us just this once, Doctor Kang.

95
00:06:36.002 --> 00:06:39.898
Geez, they're asking
for a young kid's help

96
00:06:39.898 --> 00:06:43.021
because they don't even know
that you're here for revenge.

97
00:06:43.021 --> 00:06:46.521
How would they react
if they knew about the real you?

98
00:06:47.021 --> 00:06:49.540
Haven't you heard that saying
about the nature of human beings?

99
00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.476
The belief that people can
change within 10 days

100
00:06:51.476 --> 00:06:54.992
and can't stay the same
for 100 days is this world's logic.

101
00:06:57.156 --> 00:07:00.490
They may love you now

102
00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.990
but who knows when you'll change?

103
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.362
What will happen when they
find out what you're really like?

104
00:07:23.701 --> 00:07:26.201
You must be really happy, Doctor Kang.

105
00:07:26.701 --> 00:07:29.000
Since so many people
come looking for you.

106
00:07:50.351 --> 00:07:52.851
Geez, that quack.

107
00:07:55.088 --> 00:07:58.947
No, I'm not talking about you,
but that chief son of a bitch.

108
00:08:00.721 --> 00:08:02.321
Please show me your hand.

109
00:08:05.709 --> 00:08:09.995
I vomited all night after taking
the medicine that bastard gave me.

110
00:08:09.995 --> 00:08:14.945
I felt uncomfortable,
and kept feeling pain here.

111
00:08:14.945 --> 00:08:16.544
It was really weird.

112
00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:23.017
Do you feel itchy,
but can't tell exactly where it itches?

113
00:08:23.017 --> 00:08:27.817
Have you seen a decrease in the
volume of your urine or a darker color?

114
00:08:27.817 --> 00:08:32.017
Yeah, now that I think about it,
I haven't peed it a while.

115
00:08:32.567 --> 00:08:35.938
Do you sense any swelling in your body?

116
00:08:35.938 --> 00:08:37.139
What?

117
00:08:42.301 --> 00:08:44.000
Let me take a look.

118
00:09:02.049 --> 00:09:04.369
<i>His jaundice has worsened</i>

119
00:09:04.369 --> 00:09:06.369
<i>and his skin is dry.</i>

120
00:09:07.379 --> 00:09:09.328
<i>His hands are yellow.</i>

121
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:13.429
<i>He's starting to show symptoms
of hepatitis and acute renal failure.</i>

122
00:09:14.005 --> 00:09:17.346
Why are you staring at me like that?
You're making me self-conscious.

123
00:09:17.346 --> 00:09:19.745
Oh, it's nothing.

124
00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:29.394
I'm right, aren't I? That bastard
gave me the wrong medicine, didn't he?

125
00:09:29.937 --> 00:09:32.961
There's no way.
Chief Baek is a skilled doctor.

126
00:09:32.961 --> 00:09:33.961
Wait...

127
00:09:35.811 --> 00:09:39.630
Wait, then why can't I pee,
and why did I vomit all night long?

128
00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:42.431
Right after I took
the medicine that bastard gave me.

129
00:09:42.431 --> 00:09:45.115
It wasn't because of
the medicine he gave you

130
00:09:45.115 --> 00:09:47.514
but because of the medicine I gave you.

131
00:09:48.014 --> 00:09:49.215
What?

132
00:09:51.506 --> 00:09:55.256
I'm saying that your body has
became strange because of me.

133
00:09:55.256 --> 00:09:58.582
- Why?
- It's a type of phenomenon.

134
00:09:58.582 --> 00:10:02.383
You can look at it as a side effect
of your body's recovery process.

135
00:10:03.801 --> 00:10:06.250
Ph... ph...

136
00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:09.967
- Are you sure about that?
- Don't go off of it because it's hard.

137
00:10:09.967 --> 00:10:13.418
You must take the medicine
consistently for it to have an effect.

138
00:10:13.418 --> 00:10:15.052
Okay.

139
00:10:15.052 --> 00:10:19.030
I might not trust that son of a bitch,
but I listen to you pretty well.

140
00:10:21.801 --> 00:10:25.568
But you don't know why
that bastard's here, do you?

141
00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:31.791
He's not here for work,
but because of his son.

142
00:10:33.107 --> 00:10:35.508
4817, that fat bastard.

143
00:10:35.508 --> 00:10:37.062
I'm sure you're mistaken.

144
00:10:37.062 --> 00:10:41.062
How am I mistaken?
I can tell, just by looking at them.

145
00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:43.900
You guessed wrong.

146
00:10:44.927 --> 00:10:47.936
Fine. Look at you
defending your superior.

147
00:10:47.936 --> 00:10:49.936
Okay. Okay.

148
00:10:51.851 --> 00:10:55.086
By the way, why are you here?

149
00:10:55.086 --> 00:10:57.086
Do you have a reason?

150
00:10:58.301 --> 00:11:01.500
- I came here to make money.
- Money?

151
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:02.931
Yes.

152
00:11:04.494 --> 00:11:07.193
A man who wants
to make money came to a prison?

153
00:11:08.061 --> 00:11:11.818
Did you lose your mind, by any chance?

154
00:11:12.701 --> 00:11:17.101
I have much more free time here,
compared to other places.

155
00:11:17.701 --> 00:11:20.510
I can work part-time
jobs in my free time too.

156
00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:21.811
Part-time jobs?

157
00:11:26.919 --> 00:11:30.916
People who were stabbed or shot.

158
00:11:30.916 --> 00:11:34.457
There are a lot of people
who can't go to hospitals.

159
00:11:34.457 --> 00:11:36.457
I can make a lot of money from that.

160
00:11:38.349 --> 00:11:41.448
What the heck? That's illegal too.

161
00:11:41.448 --> 00:11:43.448
I didn't think you were like that.

162
00:11:44.801 --> 00:11:48.811
There's one thing I realized after
seeing countless patients in hospitals.

163
00:11:48.811 --> 00:11:51.811
I can't become rich
by making money in a fair way.

164
00:11:52.801 --> 00:11:57.000
Whether it's legal or illegal,
all I care about is making money.

165
00:12:03.121 --> 00:12:05.677
Do you want me to introduce
you to a part-time job?

166
00:12:07.301 --> 00:12:12.000
If you do it just once, you can make
enough money to last you a lifetime.

167
00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:37.000
Taking your medicine is important,
but what you eat is also important.

168
00:12:37.754 --> 00:12:41.754
I'll write down the foods that are
bad for you, so please avoid them.

169
00:12:45.196 --> 00:12:49.220
<i>[Foods to avoid: fried food, red meat,
instant food, artificial flavors.]</i>

170
00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:58.533
I'll make sure to keep that in mind.

171
00:13:02.124 --> 00:13:04.556
It's tiring to do two
examinations, isn't it?

172
00:13:04.556 --> 00:13:08.479
Why would it be hard?
This is for my daughter, after all.

173
00:13:08.479 --> 00:13:11.788
I wondered if I could
finally do my part as a father

174
00:13:11.788 --> 00:13:15.374
but that didn't work out,
so I have to inconvenience someone else.

175
00:13:15.374 --> 00:13:18.274
But this is all for your daughter.

176
00:13:18.274 --> 00:13:20.484
I still want to give her mine.

177
00:13:20.484 --> 00:13:23.984
I did nothing but
give her trouble all my life.

178
00:13:26.032 --> 00:13:28.860
Gyung Seo must be happy.

179
00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:33.085
Since she has
a warm-hearted father like you.

180
00:13:35.324 --> 00:13:39.324
Don't you have a father?

181
00:13:40.771 --> 00:13:45.580
I do. I do, but...

182
00:13:46.791 --> 00:13:49.391
it doesn't feel like I do.

183
00:13:51.224 --> 00:13:53.811
Fathers are usually like that.

184
00:13:53.811 --> 00:13:57.620
But they still care
and think about their children.

185
00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:01.401
It's just that they don't know
how to express it properly.

186
00:14:03.512 --> 00:14:05.296
Do you think so?

187
00:14:07.484 --> 00:14:10.508
- By the way...
- Yes?

188
00:14:10.508 --> 00:14:13.239
Can Doctor Kang...

189
00:14:13.239 --> 00:14:16.237
operate on my daughter?

190
00:14:16.737 --> 00:14:21.139
I heard that he's going
to participate in this surgery.

191
00:14:21.139 --> 00:14:23.013
The rumors sure spread quickly.

192
00:14:23.013 --> 00:14:26.383
How did you find that out
when you were in here the whole time?

193
00:14:26.383 --> 00:14:28.762
I have the prison guard here.

194
00:14:28.762 --> 00:14:31.922
I'll try asking him for you.

195
00:14:31.922 --> 00:14:33.481
Thank you.

196
00:14:35.023 --> 00:14:38.976
He's the only doctor I know.

197
00:14:39.547 --> 00:14:41.346
He's like a son.

198
00:14:52.023 --> 00:14:53.917
Are you really going to be like this?

199
00:14:53.917 --> 00:14:56.620
You said that it's not even
Dad that I'd be giving it to.

200
00:14:56.620 --> 00:15:00.003
Why do I have to donate
my liver to a complete stranger?

201
00:15:00.003 --> 00:15:03.303
That's the only way
they'll donate theirs to your dad.

202
00:15:04.446 --> 00:15:06.647
Everyone dies eventually.

203
00:15:06.647 --> 00:15:09.000
You'll die, and I'll die too.

204
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.411
Do you have to go this far?

205
00:15:10.411 --> 00:15:12.911
If we can save him,
we should do everything we can.

206
00:15:12.911 --> 00:15:14.710
He's your father.

207
00:15:16.691 --> 00:15:18.891
Geez, seriously!

208
00:15:21.596 --> 00:15:24.840
Do you hate it that much?

209
00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:27.040
This isn't about
anyone else, but your father.

210
00:15:27.638 --> 00:15:30.638
Should I like this situation then?

211
00:15:39.481 --> 00:15:41.981
Fine, go.

212
00:15:43.023 --> 00:15:46.124
Go before I change my mind.

213
00:15:48.415 --> 00:15:49.839
Go on.

214
00:15:57.224 --> 00:15:58.923
But...

215
00:15:58.925 --> 00:16:02.362
the moment you leave
this room, our relationship is over.

216
00:16:02.362 --> 00:16:05.066
I'll take you right out
of the family registry.

217
00:16:05.066 --> 00:16:09.088
You know that both your house
and car are under my name, right?

218
00:16:09.088 --> 00:16:12.354
- Mom.
- Don't call me that.

219
00:16:13.532 --> 00:16:15.231

for their examinations.

223
00:16:30.781 --> 00:16:33.200
We'll have both test
results by tomorrow then.

224
00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:36.036
- It'll probably be out by morning.
- What about the operating room?

225
00:16:36.036 --> 00:16:39.018
The operating room
will be vacant after 7:30 p.m.

226
00:16:39.018 --> 00:16:42.490
Then, monitor the donors
and recipients starting today

227
00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:45.051
so that we can operate
as soon as the results come out.

228
00:16:45.051 --> 00:16:46.151
Okay.

229

Has In Kyu replied yet?

230
00:16:52.524 --> 00:16:55.624
I contacted him because Baek Gyung Seo's
guardian wants him as his doctor

231
00:16:55.624 --> 00:16:58.024
but he hasn't responded yet.

- Why do you think?
- What?

It was obviously about money.

240
00:17:55.272 --> 00:17:58.949
Um, Doctor. Sunrim Hospital called again

241
00:17:58.949 --> 00:18:02.249
to ask why you hadn't responded yet.

242

- Please send an official document.

243
00:18:08.524 --> 00:18:10.506
That I can't participate.

we'll be able to

So... start him off with a small job.
