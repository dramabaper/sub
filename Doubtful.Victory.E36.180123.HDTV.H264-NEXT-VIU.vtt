(Episode 36)

4
00:00:26.194 --> 00:00:27.565
Don't get angry at me.

5
00:00:27.606 --> 00:00:28.736
But I am.

6
00:00:29.906 --> 00:00:31.606
I have my reasons.

7
00:00:31.606 --> 00:00:32.635
Is that so?

8
00:00:34.105 --> 00:00:35.745
How much time do you need?

9
00:00:37.845 --> 00:00:39.016
I don't know.

10
00:00:44.756 --> 00:00:45.885
What's that?

11
00:00:52.256 --> 00:00:53.296
Do you think...

12
00:00:55.196 --> 00:00:57.495
we'll be able to send Lee Kwang Ho to jail?

13
00:00:57.495 --> 00:00:59.266
We need to send him to jail.

14
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:01.436
There are laws in this country.

15
00:01:03.975 --> 00:01:04.975
I'm not sure.

16
00:01:33.736 --> 00:01:38.475
Your sitter took the day off today, so I came instead.

17
00:01:39.005 --> 00:01:42.546
I know. My mom told me this morning that you'd come pick me up instead.

18
00:01:42.906 --> 00:01:44.645
Oh, I see.

19
00:01:51.016 --> 00:01:52.115
What do you want to do?

20
00:01:53.285 --> 00:01:57.395
My mom told me that you'll buy me something delicious.

21
00:01:59.356 --> 00:02:03.335
She also told me to spend some time with you.

22
00:02:05.335 --> 00:02:06.466
Didn't you know?

23
00:02:07.166 --> 00:02:09.736
No, I knew.

24
00:02:10.636 --> 00:02:12.435
What do you want to eat?

25
00:02:14.476 --> 00:02:16.106
I haven't decided yet.

26
00:02:18.816 --> 00:02:21.286
Okay. You can take your time.

27
00:02:27.525 --> 00:02:30.125
- We'll order this. - Okay.

28
00:02:32.756 --> 00:02:34.296
Mr. Kang.

29
00:02:34.596 --> 00:02:37.865
- Are you friends with Mr. Park? - Yes.

30
00:02:37.865 --> 00:02:42.805
But why are you spending time with me instead of him?

31
00:02:48.446 --> 00:02:49.705
Your mom...

32
00:02:50.846 --> 00:02:54.745
- and Mr. Park are married, right? - Yes.

33
00:02:55.016 --> 00:02:58.115
That means he's your dad now.

34
00:02:58.555 --> 00:03:00.226
Why do you keep calling him "Mr. Park"?

35
00:03:00.226 --> 00:03:02.856
I told my teacher that he's my dad.

36
00:03:03.555 --> 00:03:05.196
I know that much.

37
00:03:05.495 --> 00:03:10.435
But he's not my real dad. That's why.

38
00:03:11.365 --> 00:03:12.766
My real dad's name is Kang Chul Gi.

39
00:03:13.465 --> 00:03:15.236
I told you about him last time.

40
00:03:15.865 --> 00:03:19.435
I heard you know both my dad and mom.

41
00:03:28.416 --> 00:03:31.185
But if you keep calling him "Mr. Park",

42
00:03:31.585 --> 00:03:33.955
don't you think he'll feel upset?

43
00:03:34.925 --> 00:03:37.726
- Are you okay with that? - No.

44
00:03:39.296 --> 00:03:42.666
But Mr. Park told me that he's fine with that.

45
00:03:44.666 --> 00:03:47.766
He may be fine with that right now.

46
00:03:49.405 --> 00:03:53.375
But if you keep calling him that, I think it could upset him.

47
00:03:53.375 --> 00:03:56.846
You're saying exactly what my mom said.

48
00:03:58.076 --> 00:04:00.185
She said the same thing.

49
00:04:00.846 --> 00:04:04.486
That's why I promised my mom that I'll call him "Mr. Park"...

50
00:04:05.256 --> 00:04:06.316
just until I'm 10.

51
00:04:06.726 --> 00:04:07.856
Good job.

52
00:04:10.995 --> 00:04:14.925
You should keep that promise. Su Chil's a great guy.

53
00:04:14.925 --> 00:04:16.466
I know that.

54
00:04:16.466 --> 00:04:20.435
He's good at making robots, and he teaches me soccer.

55
00:04:20.435 --> 00:04:23.706
On top of that, we had a race on sports day, and he came in first.

56
00:04:24.406 --> 00:04:28.046
My mom's a slow runner, but Mr. Park runs like this.

57
00:04:28.046 --> 00:04:29.875
He's really fast. He's the best.

58
00:04:31.716 --> 00:04:33.716
You must've been really happy.

59
00:04:34.115 --> 00:04:38.015
But please don't tell Mr. Park...

60
00:04:39.356 --> 00:04:41.226
that I said this.

61
00:04:42.086 --> 00:04:44.026
- Why not? - Here's your pizza.

62
00:04:44.026 --> 00:04:45.026
Okay.

63
00:04:46.195 --> 00:04:47.425
It looks delicious.

64
00:04:49.466 --> 00:04:51.736
- Enjoy. - Okay. Thank you.

65
00:04:51.995 --> 00:04:53.065
Here.

66
00:05:00.075 --> 00:05:02.375
Is it delicious? Eat as much as you want.

67
00:05:03.276 --> 00:05:07.945
By the way, are you going to meet my dad soon?

68
00:05:08.846 --> 00:05:09.856
Why do you ask?

69
00:05:12.086 --> 00:05:14.255
Can you tell him this when you meet him?

70
00:05:15.055 --> 00:05:18.055
- What should I tell him? - Tell him that I haven't forgotten.

71
00:05:19.656 --> 00:05:23.026
If he ever sees me in the future...

72
00:05:24.195 --> 00:05:27.166
and notices that I call Mr. Park my dad,

73
00:05:28.106 --> 00:05:29.635
please tell him that...

74
00:05:31.036 --> 00:05:32.736
it's not because I forgot about him.

75
00:05:51.956 --> 00:05:53.125
Mom.

76
00:05:55.865 --> 00:05:57.336
- Did you have fun? - Yes.

77
00:05:58.495 --> 00:05:59.495
We had fun, right?

78
00:06:00.265 --> 00:06:01.265
Of course.

79
00:06:01.765 --> 00:06:04.675
- Mom, I need to go to the bathroom. - Okay. Let's go.

80
00:06:05.575 --> 00:06:07.075
I can go by myself.

81
00:06:15.815 --> 00:06:16.885
It was hard, wasn't it?

82
00:06:18.815 --> 00:06:20.456
He's not easy to look after.

83
00:06:21.755 --> 00:06:22.956
No, it was fine.

84
00:06:24.096 --> 00:06:25.596
It was my first time spending time with a kid.

85
00:06:26.526 --> 00:06:32.336
I told him a lot of stories about his dad until he was four.

86
00:06:34.005 --> 00:06:37.276
Because back then, I thought you'd come back.

87
00:06:38.536 --> 00:06:39.945
But one day,

88
00:06:40.976 --> 00:06:43.716
I suddenly realized that you were never going to return.

89
00:06:45.646 --> 00:06:48.615
So I hid all your photos and stopped talking about you.

90
00:06:50.185 --> 00:06:52.055
He doesn't remember having seen your photos,

91
00:06:53.185 --> 00:06:55.255
but he must've remembered your name.

92
00:06:57.055 --> 00:06:58.296
I see.

93
00:07:05.096 --> 00:07:09.365
You went through so much by having to raise him all by yourself.

94
00:07:10.706 --> 00:07:11.706
No.

95
00:07:12.106 --> 00:07:15.046
I was able to live because of Kang.

96
00:07:22.416 --> 00:07:25.956
I'm glad Kang had a good time.

97
00:07:27.456 --> 00:07:34.026
Okay. I'll see you later at home. Okay. Bye.

98
00:07:34.995 --> 00:07:35.995
What is it?

99
00:07:36.065 --> 00:07:37.065
Well...

100
00:07:37.765 --> 00:07:41.236
Inspector Park, where's Jang Pil Sung?

101
00:07:41.236 --> 00:07:42.305
What are you talking about?

102
00:07:42.305 --> 00:07:45.175
You guys were supposed to take him to Prosecutor Kim.

103
00:07:45.175 --> 00:07:47.346
I know, but he's gone.

104
00:07:47.346 --> 00:07:48.976
We were told that someone from our team took him.

105
00:07:48.976 --> 00:07:50.216
Who?

106
00:08:04.995 --> 00:08:06.425
What's going on right now?

107
00:08:08.365 --> 00:08:09.966
I'm going to corner you.

108
00:08:11.865 --> 00:08:13.635
Do you even have anything to corner me with?

109
00:08:18.276 --> 00:08:19.435
(Certificate of Admission)

110
00:08:19.435 --> 00:08:21.276
Your daughter who's currently studying abroad in Australia...

111
00:08:22.675 --> 00:08:25.115
You sent her abroad after forging her academic background.

112
00:08:25.115 --> 00:08:26.375
Kim Jong Sam.

113
00:08:29.245 --> 00:08:31.015
What are you doing?

114
00:08:31.015 --> 00:08:33.755
Don't you know that messing with my kids is crossing the line?

115
00:08:33.755 --> 00:08:34.826
No, I don't.

116
00:08:38.956 --> 00:08:42.795
Your daughter's going to be so ashamed if this becomes public.

117
00:08:43.836 --> 00:08:45.336
She won't be able to get a job either.

118
00:08:45.836 --> 00:08:46.966
You jerk.

119
00:08:53.035 --> 00:08:54.275
What do you want?

120
00:09:04.255 --> 00:09:05.316
Talk.

121
00:09:06.486 --> 00:09:07.956
Who ordered you to...

122
00:09:09.056 --> 00:09:10.326
murder Chairman Jin Jung Gil?

123
00:09:10.326 --> 00:09:12.155
Don't you know that a testimony based on threat or coercion...

124
00:09:12.155 --> 00:09:13.365
has no legal force whatsoever?

125
00:09:13.365 --> 00:09:15.566
That's more of a reason why you should talk.

126
00:09:18.566 --> 00:09:19.596
Go on.

127
00:09:30.615 --> 00:09:32.076
(Certificate of Admission)

128
00:09:35.415 --> 00:09:36.556
Wait.

129
00:09:48.665 --> 00:09:50.336
President Lee Kwang Ho...

130
00:09:50.336 --> 00:09:51.336
Wait.

131
00:09:53.566 --> 00:09:55.336
You used to be a cop.

132
00:09:56.836 --> 00:09:58.306
Do it properly.

133
00:09:59.005 --> 00:10:00.076
Say it again.

134
00:10:01.905 --> 00:10:06.686
I, Jang Pil Sung, tried to murder Chairman Jin by pushing him from...

135
00:10:06.686 --> 00:10:10.385
the rooftop of Jinsung Group at around 11pm on November 29, 2007.

136
00:10:11.755 --> 00:10:15.456
And I was given orders to murder him...

137
00:10:15.456 --> 00:10:17.525
by Lee Kwang Ho himself.

138
00:10:24.066 --> 00:10:25.135
How easy.

139
00:10:34.005 --> 00:10:35.045
What are you doing?

140
00:10:35.645 --> 00:10:36.816
I got his statement.

141
00:10:37.115 --> 00:10:38.515
Aren't you his boss?

142
00:10:38.816 --> 00:10:41.015
You should train your staff better.

143
00:10:41.015 --> 00:10:42.216
Be quiet.

144
00:10:44.115 --> 00:10:46.556
You won't ever come back here,

145
00:10:47.785 --> 00:10:49.326
so say your goodbyes.

146
00:10:50.096 --> 00:10:51.926
- Hand him over to Prosecution. - Okay.

147
00:11:05.476 --> 00:11:06.706
Don't get too excited.

148
00:11:07.176 --> 00:11:09.045
The tables can turn at any minute.

149
00:11:29.795 --> 00:11:31.165
What were you thinking?

150
00:11:32.336 --> 00:11:34.005
What is the statement you got?

151
00:11:34.535 --> 00:11:38.306
That Lee Kwang Ho gave him orders to murder Chairman Jin.

152
00:11:44.216 --> 00:11:46.245
There is no way he would have volunteered.

153
00:11:47.415 --> 00:11:48.915
What will you use that for?

154
00:11:49.285 --> 00:11:51.316
He will deny it during interrogation.

155
00:11:51.856 --> 00:11:53.056
It doesn't matter.

156
00:11:53.625 --> 00:11:57.025
I just needed him to admit that it was true.

157
00:11:57.025 --> 00:11:58.025
Hey.

158
00:11:58.295 --> 00:12:02.395
Why would an officer want something that has no legal force?

159
00:12:03.966 --> 00:12:05.165
I'm sorry, sir.

160
00:12:07.635 --> 00:12:08.966
I'm going to quit my job.

161
00:12:09.535 --> 00:12:12.236
- What? - I just handed in my resignation.

162
00:12:13.645 --> 00:12:16.676
Mr. Oh. What are you doing?

163
00:12:17.446 --> 00:12:19.476
I understand why you might be doing this, but...

164
00:12:19.476 --> 00:12:20.515
That's why...

165
00:12:22.015 --> 00:12:23.316
you should just let me go.

166
00:12:24.686 --> 00:12:25.856
What is he talking about?

167
00:12:30.196 --> 00:12:31.226
I'm...

168
00:12:33.326 --> 00:12:34.525
Lee Kwang Ho's son.

169
00:12:36.495 --> 00:12:37.495
His biological son.

170
00:12:39.765 --> 00:12:41.306
I already had a DNA test.

171
00:12:52.576 --> 00:12:53.816
Mr. Oh!

172
00:13:31.486 --> 00:13:32.556
I got it.

173
00:13:34.155 --> 00:13:35.155
Yes.

174
00:13:38.426 --> 00:13:39.495
Hey,

175
00:13:40.196 --> 00:13:42.025
why did you take so long...

176
00:13:42.025 --> 00:13:44.895
to hand in such an important document?

177
00:13:44.895 --> 00:13:46.096
Because it's important.

178
00:13:46.905 --> 00:13:50.106
As you can see, it was hard to collect.

179
00:13:50.836 --> 00:13:51.905
I bet.

180
00:13:54.806 --> 00:13:56.576
Have some before it gets cold.

181
00:14:00.045 --> 00:14:01.285
So,

182
00:14:01.645 --> 00:14:05.115
this is the list of assets Lee Kwang Ho snuck out to Macao?

183
00:14:05.556 --> 00:14:07.186
This must have been hard work...

184
00:14:07.826 --> 00:14:10.795
since you had to work with locals.

185
00:14:10.795 --> 00:14:12.326
At the end of all the deals,

186
00:14:12.655 --> 00:14:15.025
you'll find Lee Kwang Ho.

187
00:14:15.696 --> 00:14:16.765
Still,

188
00:14:17.865 --> 00:14:20.106
you should have finished it yourself.

189
00:14:21.206 --> 00:14:22.606
Looking at this...

190
00:14:22.606 --> 00:14:25.936
makes me want to arrest Lee Kwang Ho right away.

191
00:14:25.936 --> 00:14:27.946
My heart is bouncing.

192
00:14:27.946 --> 00:14:30.716
Now, I have to hold it down while investigating.

193
00:14:31.745 --> 00:14:33.915
I don't even know anyone in Macao.

194
00:14:34.115 --> 00:14:35.216
That's you're problem.

195
00:14:37.885 --> 00:14:39.115
I gave you one,

196
00:14:39.885 --> 00:14:41.125
so you owe me one.

197
00:14:41.226 --> 00:14:45.556
Right. I don't like being in debt.

198
00:14:49.966 --> 00:14:51.165
Would it be all right...

199
00:14:51.466 --> 00:14:53.635
if I gave you one with an expired statute of limitations?

200
00:14:54.106 --> 00:14:55.165
Of course.

201
00:15:05.875 --> 00:15:08.045
This has no legal force,

202
00:15:08.645 --> 00:15:11.056
but it's a hot one.

203
00:15:11.856 --> 00:15:13.556
I found out just this morning.

204
00:15:14.056 --> 00:15:15.486
The ones involved are quite impressive.

205
00:15:16.326 --> 00:15:18.795
It might make you feel sentimental.

206
00:15:28.819 --> 00:15:33.819
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E36 Doubtful Victory "I'm His Biological Son"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

207
00:15:42.785 --> 00:15:44.356
Chul Gi, Mr. Oh...

208
00:15:44.556 --> 00:15:48.486
No, Kim Jong Sam resigned. Go and see him right away.

209
00:15:55.926 --> 00:15:57.466
What are you thinking?

210
00:16:00.236 --> 00:16:01.806
Did Inspector Park call you?

211
00:16:03.706 --> 00:16:04.806
I knew it.

212
00:16:07.245 --> 00:16:08.245
But...

213
00:16:08.676 --> 00:16:10.446
I was a fake to begin with.

214
00:16:10.716 --> 00:16:12.275
What is your plan?

215
00:16:13.086 --> 00:16:16.615
I've been collecting evidence related to Lee Kwang Ho.

216
00:16:17.856 --> 00:16:19.885
I won't make things complicated and go through the law.

217
00:16:20.255 --> 00:16:21.856
I'm going to release it to the media.

218
00:16:23.426 --> 00:16:26.926
I recorded Jang Pil Sung's statement too.

219
00:16:28.525 --> 00:16:29.525
Jong Sam.

220
00:16:30.165 --> 00:16:31.696
What you're trying to do...

221
00:16:32.295 --> 00:16:34.035
is something I've been preparing for a long time.

222
00:16:34.635 --> 00:16:36.336
You don't have to get involved.

223
00:16:36.336 --> 00:16:38.936
Chul Gi. I have to.

224
00:16:40.976 --> 00:16:43.076
I must resolve it with Lee Kwang Ho myself...

225
00:16:44.415 --> 00:16:46.515
so that I can find my place.

226
00:16:52.486 --> 00:16:53.655
Let's meet with the press.

227
00:16:57.125 --> 00:16:59.826
Mr. Cha's notes, evidence from Odong Blowfish House,

228
00:16:59.826 --> 00:17:01.295
and Jang Pil Sung's statement.

229
00:17:01.426 --> 00:17:03.665
That's enough to draw in interest, right?

230
00:17:03.665 --> 00:17:07.136
Sure, but it won't be easy. I would have done it already.

231
00:17:08.805 --> 00:17:10.876
Here. Add this to your list.

232
00:17:11.605 --> 00:17:15.105
It proves Lee Kwang Ho murdered Gook Su Ran's son.

233
00:17:19.345 --> 00:17:20.386
Wait.

234
00:17:21.785 --> 00:17:25.255
Then the buried child in the notes...

235
00:17:33.126 --> 00:17:35.795
Where is the end to this? No...

236
00:17:36.866 --> 00:17:38.595
Where did it even start?

237
00:17:40.065 --> 00:17:41.136
Lee Kwang Ho.

238
00:17:42.666 --> 00:17:43.805
Did you get anything?

239
00:17:43.805 --> 00:17:45.605
They told me to report it as false.

240
00:17:45.605 --> 00:17:47.005
Lee Kwang Ho's in trouble.

241
00:17:47.105 --> 00:17:48.775
Reporter Park is on it.

242
00:17:54.486 --> 00:17:55.815
They contacted the press?

243
00:17:56.285 --> 00:17:57.616
What's happening?

244
00:17:57.916 --> 00:17:59.255
We told them it's a false accusation,

245
00:17:59.255 --> 00:18:01.186
and that it'll be war if they release anything.

246
00:18:01.486 --> 00:18:03.126
We're trying to block it,

247
00:18:03.956 --> 00:18:05.595
but you might have to get involved.

248
00:18:07.226 --> 00:18:10.866
Call all the editors.

249
00:18:11.136 --> 00:18:12.565
Prepare a dinner.

250
00:18:12.765 --> 00:18:13.805
Yes, sir.

251
00:18:13.805 --> 00:18:16.236
Prepare something else for the reporters.

252
00:18:17.035 --> 00:18:20.845
They must be salivating. They will be sad to go empty-handed.

253
00:18:22.305 --> 00:18:25.545
There is Jang Pil Sung. He'll be released soon.

254
00:18:25.815 --> 00:18:28.446
A Korean police chief was involved in a murder.

255
00:18:29.315 --> 00:18:30.656
They can go with that.

256
00:18:31.716 --> 00:18:34.855
But, Kim Jong Sam released Jang Pil Sung's testimony.

257
00:18:34.855 --> 00:18:37.156
That's why his news should come out first.

258
00:18:37.595 --> 00:18:41.126
That will make it look like he made it up to get out of it.

259
00:18:41.396 --> 00:18:42.565
I'll get to it right away.

260
00:18:45.736 --> 00:18:47.035
One more thing.

261
00:18:48.535 --> 00:18:51.136
Kill Kim Jong Sam right away.

262
00:18:52.305 --> 00:18:54.605
He lived for too long.

263
00:18:57.015 --> 00:18:58.045
Yes, sir.

264
00:19:17.466 --> 00:19:18.535
Well?

265
00:19:19.166 --> 00:19:20.535
Do you find anything uncomfortable?

266
00:19:20.535 --> 00:19:23.176
- We're obviously uncomfortable. - Stay put.

267
00:19:23.636 --> 00:19:26.035
You should go if it's uncomfortable.

268
00:19:28.176 --> 00:19:30.176
Unfortunately, only one of you can go.

269
00:19:30.476 --> 00:19:31.946
What do you mean?

270
00:19:31.946 --> 00:19:34.785
I need one of you to take care of someone.

271
00:19:35.085 --> 00:19:37.156
If we hear the news that you're arrested,

272
00:19:37.156 --> 00:19:39.755
the other person will be released.

273
00:19:39.926 --> 00:19:41.085
Arrested?

274
00:19:41.325 --> 00:19:42.986
Don't get pressured.

275
00:19:43.095 --> 00:19:45.426
It'll be just a simple car accident.

276
00:19:49.366 --> 00:19:50.835
What if we don't agree?

277
00:19:51.035 --> 00:19:54.035
You'll both be stuck here.

278
00:19:55.366 --> 00:19:57.575
- Does Chairwoman Gook know? - I'm not sure.

279
00:19:58.906 --> 00:20:00.305
She has no time to look after you.

280
00:20:00.775 --> 00:20:03.815
Also, this is Manager Lee's order.

281
00:20:10.486 --> 00:20:12.916
I'll do it. But Assistant Manager Ki...

282
00:20:12.916 --> 00:20:15.285
No. You have a family.

283
00:20:16.025 --> 00:20:17.226
I'll do it.

284
00:20:17.226 --> 00:20:18.226
Ki Myun Joong.

285
00:20:19.696 --> 00:20:20.726
Sir.

286
00:20:21.366 --> 00:20:22.825
You have to promise you'll release him.

287
00:20:23.335 --> 00:20:24.636
If you don't...

288
00:20:43.186 --> 00:20:44.216
General Manager Kwak.

289
00:20:45.616 --> 00:20:46.886
Stay focused.

290
00:20:47.755 --> 00:20:50.755
I'll finish up, so you better get out.

291
00:20:53.666 --> 00:20:55.025
I'm sorry, sir.

292
00:20:55.466 --> 00:20:56.535
It's okay.

293
00:20:59.835 --> 00:21:02.236
Who is the person getting hit by the car?

294
00:21:06.605 --> 00:21:08.505
That's it for News Nine today.

295
00:21:08.505 --> 00:21:10.476
Here. Let's eat.

296
00:21:11.646 --> 00:21:12.716
Today...

297
00:21:12.716 --> 00:21:14.116
It's not coming out.

298
00:21:18.616 --> 00:21:21.886
You should dress warmer tomorrow.

299
00:21:21.886 --> 00:21:24.525
You should be dressed for the cold.

300
00:21:24.626 --> 00:21:28.095
There is a cold wave warning throughout the country.

301
00:21:28.196 --> 00:21:29.396
Jong Sam.

302
00:21:29.396 --> 00:21:31.436
The cold will stay with us for a while.

303
00:21:31.436 --> 00:21:33.035
We'll get a low of minus 10°C...

304
00:21:33.035 --> 00:21:36.166
Something has been on my mind for the last few days.

305
00:21:37.906 --> 00:21:41.646
I think I was too greedy before.

306
00:21:42.706 --> 00:21:44.245
You were just a child.

307
00:21:46.176 --> 00:21:49.085
I only thought of myself while trying to catch Lee Kwang Ho.

308
00:21:49.085 --> 00:21:51.015
Don't be like that.

309
00:21:52.315 --> 00:21:54.325
Ever since my mom died,

310
00:21:54.325 --> 00:21:56.285
you were the only person...

311
00:21:56.956 --> 00:21:58.355
who treated me like a human.

312
00:21:59.295 --> 00:22:01.825
I lived on the streets as if that was my home.

313
00:22:02.166 --> 00:22:03.765
Then, I got a real room.

314
00:22:05.736 --> 00:22:06.866
I remember those days.

315
00:22:07.406 --> 00:22:10.676
Ddak Ji and I were so excited to have a room.

316
00:22:13.775 --> 00:22:16.616
Anyway, I would be a burglar now if it wasn't for you.

317
00:22:19.075 --> 00:22:21.015
I passed the police exam...

318
00:22:21.845 --> 00:22:22.986
and got to work too.

319
00:22:24.416 --> 00:22:28.555
I could have taken care of you without making you do work.

320
00:22:31.956 --> 00:22:33.366
If you never met me...

321
00:22:33.366 --> 00:22:34.495
Forget it.

322
00:22:35.995 --> 00:22:39.736
I had so much fun catching the bad guys with you.

323
00:22:40.765 --> 00:22:42.966
Let's just eat ramyeon.

324
00:22:45.736 --> 00:22:47.775
A chief of Korean police...

325
00:22:47.775 --> 00:22:51.315
was found to have been involved in a murder 10 years ago.

326
00:22:51.575 --> 00:22:54.315
The victim is Chairman Jin Jung Gil of Jinsung Group...

327
00:22:54.315 --> 00:22:56.085
who was thought to have committed suicide.

328
00:22:56.216 --> 00:22:58.716
We have yet to find out the reason for the murder.

329
00:22:59.156 --> 00:23:02.156
As a current acting chief was involved in the murder...

330
00:23:02.156 --> 00:23:04.095
What is this? What about Lee Kwang Ho?

331
00:23:04.095 --> 00:23:06.055
They're using a trick.

332
00:23:06.565 --> 00:23:08.726
They're trying to cover up everything we handed it,

333
00:23:08.726 --> 00:23:10.295
and make the public focus on Jang Pil Sung.

334
00:23:10.295 --> 00:23:12.765
What's wrong with the press?

335
00:23:12.765 --> 00:23:15.535
With Lee Kwang Ho's wealth, connections, and power,

336
00:23:15.666 --> 00:23:17.005
it's not impossible.

337
00:23:18.335 --> 00:23:21.275
Is everything going to get buried like this?

338
00:23:21.305 --> 00:23:22.376
No.

339
00:23:23.515 --> 00:23:24.976
They can't cover it all.

340
00:23:30.986 --> 00:23:32.116
(Restricted Number)

341
00:23:51.136 --> 00:23:53.976
(Chief Jang Pil Sung Arrested for Engaging in Murder)

342
00:23:56.416 --> 00:23:57.515
Turn it off.

343
00:24:00.085 --> 00:24:01.815
That's all I needed to know.

344
00:24:03.015 --> 00:24:05.555
It's all the same story everywhere.

345
00:24:11.095 --> 00:24:13.495
It would have been better if we arrested him earlier.

346
00:24:15.595 --> 00:24:17.396
Also, we...

347
00:24:17.936 --> 00:24:19.265
It's fine as long as he's arrested.

348
00:24:20.236 --> 00:24:24.075
Your dad will be proud of you.

349
00:24:24.605 --> 00:24:25.835
I bet he's happy.

350
00:24:27.605 --> 00:24:31.015
How about some makgeolli...

351
00:24:31.176 --> 00:24:32.446
with your dad's wine glasses?

352
00:24:33.416 --> 00:24:34.416
I'm in.

353
00:24:46.156 --> 00:24:47.226
Mom.

354
00:24:47.396 --> 00:24:48.466
Yes?

355
00:24:52.966 --> 00:24:55.466
It must have been tough on you.

356
00:24:58.676 --> 00:25:01.005
I can't seem to shake it right today.

357
00:25:13.626 --> 00:25:14.626
Here.

358
00:25:16.656 --> 00:25:20.466
What if I knew a family member...

359
00:25:20.896 --> 00:25:24.136
of the person who did that to Dad? What should I do?

360
00:25:24.966 --> 00:25:26.366
Do what?

361
00:25:27.706 --> 00:25:30.206
It's not their fault they're his family.

362
00:25:30.736 --> 00:25:32.636
Just act as you normally would.

363
00:25:33.245 --> 00:25:36.616
However, that person will feel uncomfortable and sorry.

364
00:25:36.646 --> 00:25:39.176
That's their problem.

365
00:25:39.916 --> 00:25:41.446
What can you do about their feelings?

366
00:25:43.285 --> 00:25:46.085
By the way, who is it?

367
00:25:47.755 --> 00:25:49.426
The bad guy's family.

368
00:25:50.396 --> 00:25:52.025
I don't know.

369
00:25:53.055 --> 00:25:54.995
I was just asking.

370
00:26:12.376 --> 00:26:14.585
Who is the person getting hit by the car?

371
00:26:15.515 --> 00:26:16.585
Kim Jong Sam.

372
00:26:54.426 --> 00:26:55.956
Are you sure you can meet him alone?

373
00:26:56.226 --> 00:26:58.995
He was Lee Kwang Ho's hostage just a moment ago.

374
00:26:59.966 --> 00:27:01.295
He was released...

375
00:27:01.595 --> 00:27:03.396
in exchange for blowing the whistle on Chairwoman Gook.

376
00:27:05.366 --> 00:27:06.835
What if it's a trap?

377
00:27:07.265 --> 00:27:10.105
He would never betray Chairwoman Gook.

378
00:27:11.176 --> 00:27:13.376
Also, he abducted Ddak Ji.

379
00:27:13.646 --> 00:27:17.216
I have to record his testimony saying Lee Kwang Ho ordered it.

380
00:27:18.716 --> 00:27:20.845
Anyway, come back if you smell anything fishy.

381
00:27:20.845 --> 00:27:21.946
I'll wait here.

382
00:27:23.686 --> 00:27:24.716
Okay.

383
00:27:38.866 --> 00:27:39.936

386

387

392
00:28:31.785 --> 00:28:33.825

Chul Gi!

394
00:28:42.795 --> 00:28:44.666
Chul Gi! Wake up!

395
00:28:45.795 --> 00:28:49.206
911... 911! 911!

Chul Gi. Chul Gi.

399
00:28:57.015 --> 00:28:58.745
Chul Gi, don't die!

400
00:28:59.886 --> 00:29:02.446

401
00:29:05.686 --> 00:29:07.825
Please call 911!
