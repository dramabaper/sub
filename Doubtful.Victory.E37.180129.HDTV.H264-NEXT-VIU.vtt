1
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.399
(All the characters, organizations, places, and happenings...)

2
00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:07.760
(in this drama are all fake and are not based on a true story.)

3
00:00:08.268 --> 00:00:09.837
How can you even call yourself a human being?

4
00:00:09.837 --> 00:00:11.167
Since when did you know that...

5
00:00:11.167 --> 00:00:13.237
Kim Jong Sam is your son?

6
00:00:13.237 --> 00:00:14.507
I'm whose son?

7
00:00:14.507 --> 00:00:16.677
What kind of nonsense is that?

8
00:00:16.677 --> 00:00:18.648
- Are you sure he's his son? - It's probably true.

9
00:00:18.648 --> 00:00:19.677
I'm here to warn you.

10
00:00:19.677 --> 00:00:21.848
I'm going to take you down myself.

11
00:00:21.848 --> 00:00:25.247
The nail clippings from Odong Blowfish House belongs to Ms. Hong.

12
00:00:25.247 --> 00:00:28.657
And the extra DNA found on it was confirmed as Lee Kwang Ho's.

13
00:00:28.657 --> 00:00:30.888
Here's Jang Pil Sung's weakness. Use this to make him confess that...

14
00:00:30.888 --> 00:00:33.228
he killed Chairman Jin on Lee Kwang Ho's orders,

15
00:00:33.228 --> 00:00:34.297
and record that.

16
00:00:34.297 --> 00:00:36.867
Where's Jang Pil Sung? We were told that someone from our team took him.

17
00:00:36.867 --> 00:00:38.367
Your daughter who's currently studying abroad in Australia...

18
00:00:38.367 --> 00:00:40.238
You sent her abroad after forging her academic background.

19
00:00:40.238 --> 00:00:41.768
You jerk. What do you want?

20
00:00:41.768 --> 00:00:44.738
Talk. Who ordered you to murder Chairman Jin Jung Gil?

21
00:00:44.738 --> 00:00:45.738
What are you doing?

22
00:00:45.738 --> 00:00:49.308
Why would an officer want something that has no legal force?

23
00:00:49.308 --> 00:00:51.848
I'm going to quit my job. I just handed in my resignation.

24
00:00:51.848 --> 00:00:52.878
What are you talking about?

25
00:00:52.878 --> 00:00:55.617
I'm Lee Kwang Ho's biological son.

26
00:00:55.617 --> 00:00:56.988
What are you thinking?

27
00:00:56.988 --> 00:01:00.217
I've been collecting evidence related to Lee Kwang Ho.

28
00:01:00.217 --> 00:01:01.357
I'm going to release it to the media.

29
00:01:01.357 --> 00:01:03.658
Mr. Cha's notebook, evidence from Odong Blowfish House,

30
00:01:03.658 --> 00:01:04.928
and Jang Pil Sung's statement.

31
00:01:04.928 --> 00:01:08.558
Add this. It proves that he also murdered Gook Su Ran's son.

32
00:01:08.558 --> 00:01:11.028
They contacted the press? There's Jang Pil Sung.

33
00:01:11.028 --> 00:01:13.497
A Korean police chief was involved in a murder.

34
00:01:13.497 --> 00:01:14.568
They can go with that.

35
00:01:14.568 --> 00:01:17.868
One more thing. Kill Kim Jong Sam right away.

36
00:01:17.868 --> 00:01:20.377
I need one of you to take care of someone.

37
00:01:20.377 --> 00:01:22.478
If we hear that you got arrested,

38
00:01:22.478 --> 00:01:24.577
the other person will be released.

39
00:01:24.577 --> 00:01:27.478
- Who do I need to kill? - Kim Jong Sam.

40
00:01:41.228 --> 00:01:42.228
Jong Sam!

41
00:01:55.778 --> 00:01:56.808
Chul Gi.

42
00:01:59.747 --> 00:02:01.448
Chul Gi.

43
00:02:01.717 --> 00:02:02.747
Chul Gi!

44
00:02:06.588 --> 00:02:07.687
Chul Gi.

45
00:02:09.188 --> 00:02:10.188
Chul Gi.

46
00:02:11.427 --> 00:02:13.698
- Chul Gi. - Jong...

47
00:02:16.198 --> 00:02:17.498
Jong Sam.

48
00:02:17.927 --> 00:02:20.098
Chul Gi...

49
00:02:22.968 --> 00:02:25.938
Chul Gi! Wake up!

50
00:02:26.938 --> 00:02:29.438
Chul Gi!

51
00:02:32.408 --> 00:02:37.517
(Ambulance)

52
00:02:51.527 --> 00:02:54.267
(Operating Room)

53
00:02:54.498 --> 00:02:56.168
You must wait out here.

54
00:03:07.948 --> 00:03:09.647
(Kang Chul Gi, in operation)

55
00:03:09.647 --> 00:03:11.047
(In Surgery)

56
00:03:25.867 --> 00:03:26.867
Il Seung.

57
00:03:30.767 --> 00:03:32.508
What's going on? What did the doctor say?

58
00:03:32.968 --> 00:03:34.677
They'll know for sure after the surgery.

59
00:03:35.307 --> 00:03:36.908
Right. He needs surgery.

60
00:03:37.908 --> 00:03:38.948
Gosh.

61
00:03:39.448 --> 00:03:42.147
Are you okay?

62
00:03:42.418 --> 00:03:44.147
- Yes. - Good.

63
00:03:44.888 --> 00:03:46.718
Right. Everything is fine.

64
00:03:47.087 --> 00:03:49.688
Chul Gi will get better quickly.

65
00:03:50.158 --> 00:03:51.688
- Inspector Park. - Yes?

66
00:03:52.487 --> 00:03:53.698
What about General Manager Kwak?

67
00:03:54.998 --> 00:03:56.827
He confessed at the scene.

68
00:03:57.668 --> 00:04:00.698
It's clear that it wasn't an accident,

69
00:04:00.698 --> 00:04:03.538
so our team will take care of the case.

70
00:04:06.008 --> 00:04:08.207
Let's sit down and wait.

71
00:04:14.077 --> 00:04:15.147
(Episode 37)

72
00:04:15.147 --> 00:04:18.748
So you stepped on the gas instead of the brake...

73
00:04:18.748 --> 00:04:20.688
by mistake.

74
00:04:20.917 --> 00:04:23.988
And the one you were after was Officer Oh.

75
00:04:25.758 --> 00:04:27.698
Do you expect us to believe that?

76
00:04:28.827 --> 00:04:30.467
Why did you do it?

77
00:04:30.827 --> 00:04:33.897
Were you really trying to kill Officer Oh?

78
00:04:34.837 --> 00:04:36.397
Please save someone first.

79
00:04:37.167 --> 00:04:38.238
What?

80
00:04:39.368 --> 00:04:40.407
Who?

81
00:04:40.407 --> 00:04:41.907
- Assistant Manager Ki. - Assistant Manager Ki?

82
00:04:42.138 --> 00:04:44.808
He's been abducted. He's probably still held as captive.

83
00:04:44.808 --> 00:04:46.917
Why are you asking us to save him?

84
00:04:46.917 --> 00:04:48.147
Didn't you forget what you've done?

85
00:04:48.147 --> 00:04:50.017
Isn't that what the police does?

86
00:04:50.017 --> 00:04:51.787
Save people, and help people.

87
00:04:51.787 --> 00:04:53.517
Assistant Manager Ki has been abducted.

88
00:04:54.017 --> 00:04:56.517
- We don't know what'll happen. - So tell us everything.

89
00:04:56.988 --> 00:04:59.258
If you tell us everything, we'll go save him.

90
00:05:09.498 --> 00:05:12.438
Let's go get Assistant Manager Ki first.

91
00:05:12.438 --> 00:05:13.907
What are you saying?

92
00:05:13.907 --> 00:05:16.077
He might be tricking us.

93
00:05:16.748 --> 00:05:19.748
If it's urgent, he's going to confess first.

94
00:05:19.748 --> 00:05:21.347
Whether he's tricking us or not,

95
00:05:21.347 --> 00:05:23.448
a man's life might be at stake.

96
00:05:24.048 --> 00:05:25.587
If we try to make a deal now,

97
00:05:25.587 --> 00:05:27.618
we are no different from them.

98
00:05:30.287 --> 00:05:32.428
This is why it's so hard to be a police officer.

99
00:05:32.787 --> 00:05:36.227
Even if he's the worst criminal, we have to save him.

100
00:05:36.227 --> 00:05:38.897
Even if we get tricked, we have to go.

101
00:05:39.568 --> 00:05:40.597
Gosh.

102
00:05:43.068 --> 00:05:44.238
So where is he?

103
00:05:45.537 --> 00:05:47.938
It's hard to explain. We have to go together.

104
00:05:52.477 --> 00:05:53.618
(Interrogation Room)

105
00:05:54.517 --> 00:05:58.147
Sergeant Kim. You should've told me sooner.

106
00:05:58.388 --> 00:06:01.287
You haven't been home early in so long.

107
00:06:01.287 --> 00:06:02.688
I felt bad about calling you.

108
00:06:02.688 --> 00:06:04.457
It doesn't matter.

109
00:06:05.128 --> 00:06:06.858
Are you going to be okay? Just the two of you?

110
00:06:08.698 --> 00:06:10.167
I'll go to the office then.

111
00:06:10.498 --> 00:06:12.267
Call me if anything happens.

112
00:06:13.167 --> 00:06:15.438
Okay. Bye.

113
00:06:16.738 --> 00:06:19.138
I thought it was strange how you came home so early.

114
00:06:19.508 --> 00:06:22.138
Why do you have so much work?

115
00:06:22.638 --> 00:06:24.548
Mom. I have to go.

116
00:06:24.707 --> 00:06:26.678
Can't you just quit?

117
00:06:27.217 --> 00:06:28.948
You already caught the one who killed your dad.

118
00:06:28.948 --> 00:06:32.087
You became a cop to find the murderer, so...

119
00:06:32.087 --> 00:06:35.488
Mom. This isn't the time to talk about that.

120
00:06:35.488 --> 00:06:36.558
I have to go.

121
00:06:37.188 --> 00:06:39.358
- Bye. - Be careful.

122
00:06:45.568 --> 00:06:47.798
Gosh. Why isn't it working?

123
00:06:48.498 --> 00:06:50.337
Why can't I break lose?

124
00:07:02.277 --> 00:07:03.347
General Manager...

125
00:07:05.188 --> 00:07:08.118
Knife... Won't you put it away?

126
00:07:08.688 --> 00:07:11.657
I'm not scared. Where's General Manager Kwak?

127
00:07:11.657 --> 00:07:13.957
I'm not scared. Where's General Manager Kwak?

128
00:07:13.957 --> 00:07:17.327
Stop it. Don't do it.

129
00:07:26.308 --> 00:07:27.407
What?

130
00:07:28.438 --> 00:07:29.477
Move.

131
00:07:30.048 --> 00:07:31.678
Okay. Sure.

132
00:07:58.267 --> 00:08:00.277
- What are you doing? Let's go. - Okay.

133
00:08:01.508 --> 00:08:03.577
Hey! Stop!

134
00:08:08.147 --> 00:08:09.217
General Manager Kwak.

135
00:08:18.488 --> 00:08:20.897
- I'll take care of this. Wait. - We have no time for that.

136
00:08:21.457 --> 00:08:22.628
- Are you okay? - Yes.

137
00:08:22.727 --> 00:08:24.568
- Run away. Quickly. - Pardon?

138
00:08:24.568 --> 00:08:26.897
Who will help Chairwoman Gook if you get caught too?

139
00:08:26.897 --> 00:08:28.267
- You can't be caught. - No.

140
00:08:28.498 --> 00:08:31.108
Chairwoman Gook has to do something, so I can too.

141
00:08:31.108 --> 00:08:32.567
- Run away. - Let's go together.

142
00:08:32.567 --> 00:08:35.177
There's no time. Hurry.

143
00:08:35.907 --> 00:08:37.008
Hurry up!

144
00:08:38.447 --> 00:08:40.947
Hang in there. I'll find a way.

145
00:08:40.947 --> 00:08:42.917
Okay. Run away.

146
00:08:43.718 --> 00:08:44.787
Go!

147
00:08:57.228 --> 00:08:58.868
Hey. Where's Assistant Manager Ki?

148
00:09:00.167 --> 00:09:01.437
Gosh.

149
00:09:02.437 --> 00:09:06.267
I had a bad feeling about this.

150
00:09:06.267 --> 00:09:07.638
He really ran away.

151
00:09:08.078 --> 00:09:09.738
I knew it.

152
00:09:09.807 --> 00:09:12.547
I was stupid to think we were on the same side.

153
00:09:14.017 --> 00:09:17.118
Sergeant Kim. It's too dark, and the place is too big.

154
00:09:17.118 --> 00:09:18.618
I don't know what's where.

155
00:09:19.147 --> 00:09:21.157
That's why it's a hide out.

156
00:09:21.488 --> 00:09:23.057
It's his home ground.

157
00:09:23.057 --> 00:09:25.027
You can't possibly catch him.

158
00:09:25.027 --> 00:09:26.458
Just shut it.

159
00:09:27.358 --> 00:09:29.328
Anyway, where's Assistant Manager Ki?

160
00:09:33.767 --> 00:09:37.208
What a traitor! Why didn't you run away too?

161
00:09:38.508 --> 00:09:40.008
I would've loved to.

162
00:09:40.937 --> 00:09:44.177
You should be thankful that I didn't escape.

163
00:09:44.177 --> 00:09:46.177
- Let's just go. - Gosh.

164
00:09:48.348 --> 00:09:50.588
(Operating Room)

165
00:09:50.588 --> 00:09:52.047
It's not your fault.

166
00:09:52.618 --> 00:09:53.718
I know.

167
00:09:54.718 --> 00:09:55.817
I should kill...

168
00:09:56.317 --> 00:09:58.358
General Manager Kwak and Lee Kwang Ho who instigated it.

169
00:10:00.157 --> 00:10:03.667
We aren't sure if Lee Kwang Ho actually ordered him.

170
00:10:04.098 --> 00:10:06.128
Don't make an assumption.

171
00:10:07.868 --> 00:10:09.697
It was General Manager Kwak,

172
00:10:09.697 --> 00:10:11.708
so it could've been Chairwoman Gook.

173
00:10:17.208 --> 00:10:19.677
- How is he? - The worst is over.

174
00:10:19.978 --> 00:10:21.378
The surgery went well.

175
00:10:22.017 --> 00:10:23.078
- Thank you. - Thank you.

176
00:10:23.888 --> 00:10:26.787
It'll take time for him to regain consciousness.

177
00:10:26.787 --> 00:10:28.588
We also need to watch his progress.

178
00:10:30.088 --> 00:10:31.828
Please be patient and wait.

179
00:10:31.828 --> 00:10:33.358
- Thank you. - Thank you.

180
00:10:37.968 --> 00:10:40.267
What did I tell you?

181
00:10:40.567 --> 00:10:43.508
Chul Gi will wake up. He's a strong guy.

182
00:10:43.508 --> 00:10:44.537
I'll go...

183
00:10:45.368 --> 00:10:46.777
get some fresh air.

184
00:10:47.437 --> 00:10:49.037
You'll be right back, won't you?

185
00:10:50.848 --> 00:10:52.547
Wait. I'll come with you.

186
00:10:53.848 --> 00:10:56.588
We can't both go. One of us should stay.

187
00:10:56.588 --> 00:10:58.147
Come right back after you get some fresh air.

188
00:10:58.147 --> 00:11:00.458
Don't go anywhere else. Don't cause any trouble.

189
00:11:09.598 --> 00:11:11.527
Why are you here? Why didn't you stay in the office?

190
00:11:11.828 --> 00:11:14.537
It felt stuffy. Where is Assistant Manager Ki?

191
00:11:18.567 --> 00:11:20.708
- Hey. - You.

192
00:11:25.447 --> 00:11:26.508
Let me go!

193
00:11:28.618 --> 00:11:30.618
Who was it? Who made you?

194
00:11:30.618 --> 00:11:32.147
Who made you do it?

195
00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.157
Isn't it obvious?

196
00:11:36.287 --> 00:11:38.728
You're running around trying to take him down.

197
00:11:38.728 --> 00:11:40.858
Lee Kwang Ho wouldn't stay put, would he?

198
00:11:43.027 --> 00:11:44.567
Was he really the one?

199
00:11:44.998 --> 00:11:46.897
Yes. Then who else?

200
00:11:48.598 --> 00:11:50.767
Chairwoman Gook was frustrated because she couldn't get him.

201
00:11:50.767 --> 00:11:52.307
That's why she decided to join forces with you.

202
00:11:54.838 --> 00:11:56.108
Let's go.

203
00:11:56.108 --> 00:11:58.248
You need to calm down.

204
00:11:59.848 --> 00:12:02.777
I'm going to kill you if anything bad happens to Chul Gi.

205
00:12:02.777 --> 00:12:04.488
I'm going to kill you!

206
00:12:05.017 --> 00:12:07.218
Officer Oh! Hey!

207
00:12:09.687 --> 00:12:10.728
Let's go.

208
00:12:39.017 --> 00:12:40.388
What's your name?

209
00:13:17.027 --> 00:13:18.027
I'm sorry.

210
00:13:19.388 --> 00:13:21.128
I never meant to push you.

211
00:13:21.427 --> 00:13:22.797
Is that all you're sorry about?

212
00:13:28.437 --> 00:13:29.838
Help me find my necklace before you go.

213
00:13:32.067 --> 00:13:34.277
I lost it when I fell down earlier.

214
00:13:35.838 --> 00:13:37.578
It's a gift I got from my dad.

215
00:13:39.547 --> 00:13:41.917
It's really important to me.

216
00:13:42.147 --> 00:13:44.547
You can leave, but help me find it first.

217
00:13:46.447 --> 00:13:47.557
What are you doing?

218
00:13:48.017 --> 00:13:49.157
Look for it with me.

219
00:13:52.787 --> 00:13:53.828
Did you hurt yourself?

220
00:13:55.397 --> 00:13:56.498
Let's find your necklace.

221
00:14:07.907 --> 00:14:08.907
So...

222
00:14:10.978 --> 00:14:12.677
So what are you going to do now?

223
00:14:14.718 --> 00:14:17.047
I think we should step aside and see how things turn out.

224
00:14:17.047 --> 00:14:19.547
What good is that going to do?

225
00:14:20.017 --> 00:14:22.618
General Manager Kwak got arrested, and we lost Assistant Manager Ki.

226
00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.927
We've lost control of Gook Su Ran, so she's going to do what she wants.

227
00:14:26.358 --> 00:14:29.998
And Kim Jong Sam is probably furious since he knows he was the target.

228
00:14:29.998 --> 00:14:32.397
So how can I just sit back and see how things go?

229
00:14:33.197 --> 00:14:36.238
Then what do you think about going abroad for a while?

230
00:14:36.968 --> 00:14:39.708
You can say you're going to look into the trend of virtual money.

231
00:14:40.138 --> 00:14:43.138
Or you could say you got invited for a lecture.

232
00:14:43.138 --> 00:14:44.677
Have you gone mad?

233
00:14:44.848 --> 00:14:46.078
Then who's going to get the money?

234
00:14:46.307 --> 00:14:48.118
Tunisia is already upset because...

235
00:14:48.118 --> 00:14:50.647
they're not sure if we're going to accept their waste or not.

236
00:14:50.647 --> 00:14:52.447
But if we even delay the schedule of receiving their money,

237
00:14:52.447 --> 00:14:54.687
this deal will get canceled!

238
00:14:55.017 --> 00:14:57.888
And we already received some money. What are we going to do about that?

239
00:14:58.027 --> 00:15:00.958
How can you even think about telling me to go abroad in this situation?

240
00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:03.868
I'm sorry, sir. I didn't think that far.

241
00:15:04.067 --> 00:15:06.368
You're running for the by-election to seal the deal with Tunisia.

242
00:15:06.368 --> 00:15:08.338
How can you not think that far?

243
00:15:08.937 --> 00:15:09.968
I apologize, sir.

244
00:15:12.868 --> 00:15:14.008
Nothing else matters.

245
00:15:14.777 --> 00:15:17.348
Just do whatever you can to put things back to normal.

246
00:15:18.177 --> 00:15:19.547
Make the police back off.

247
00:15:20.417 --> 00:15:22.017
Make sure Gook Su Ran can't act out.

248
00:15:22.547 --> 00:15:24.218
And get rid of Kim Jong Sam!

249
00:15:24.447 --> 00:15:26.348
Yes, sir. I'll do my best.

250
00:15:26.348 --> 00:15:29.687
I don't need your best! I just need results!

251
00:15:30.057 --> 00:15:31.128
Yes, sir.

252
00:15:32.652 --> 00:15:37.652
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E37 Doubtful Victory "I Want to Kill Him"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

253
00:15:39.728 --> 00:15:42.098
Chairwoman Gook. Chairwoman Gook.

254
00:15:42.437 --> 00:15:44.708
- What happened? - I escaped.

255
00:15:44.708 --> 00:15:46.537
I came to see you as soon as I escaped.

256
00:15:47.037 --> 00:15:48.638
Please help General Manager Kwak.

257
00:15:48.638 --> 00:15:50.177
He really didn't have any other choice.

258
00:15:50.177 --> 00:15:52.147
What are you talking about?

259
00:15:52.547 --> 00:15:53.547
Pardon?

260
00:15:54.718 --> 00:15:56.447
The fact that he tried to kill Kim Jong Sam.

261
00:15:57.017 --> 00:16:00.287
But please know that he never meant to betray you.

262
00:16:00.287 --> 00:16:01.718
He only did that to save me.

263
00:16:02.118 --> 00:16:05.187
So did he kill Kim Jong Sam?

264
00:16:05.287 --> 00:16:06.527
I don't think so.

265
00:16:06.858 --> 00:16:08.758
He got caught by the Hidden Crime Team.

266
00:16:09.157 --> 00:16:12.067
Chairwoman Gook, please help him.

267
00:16:12.297 --> 00:16:13.368
So you're saying that...

268
00:16:13.767 --> 00:16:16.907
General Manager Kwak is locked up, and you managed to escape.

269
00:16:17.338 --> 00:16:20.978
He failed to kill Kim Jong Sam, and you both got out.

270
00:16:21.978 --> 00:16:23.647
Lee Kwang Ho must be in a pickle.

271
00:16:24.578 --> 00:16:25.608
But...

272
00:16:26.208 --> 00:16:28.848
why did he suddenly want Kim Jong Sam dead?

273
00:16:30.417 --> 00:16:33.417
The person he'd want to kill the most right now should be me.

274
00:16:42.157 --> 00:16:43.897
Hey, forget it. Let's stop looking.

275
00:16:47.738 --> 00:16:49.197
I said, forget it.

276
00:16:55.407 --> 00:16:56.437
I'm sorry.

277
00:16:57.208 --> 00:16:59.708
I'll accept your apology for now.

278
00:17:03.447 --> 00:17:05.717
Is there anything else you should apologize to me for?

279
00:17:07.818 --> 00:17:10.628
Are you sorry that you're Lee Kwang Ho's son?

280
00:17:11.487 --> 00:17:13.927
Because he's the guy who gave orders to kill my dad?

281
00:17:15.657 --> 00:17:18.298
You fool. Why would you be sorry about that?

282
00:17:18.368 --> 00:17:19.727
Don't be sorry.

283
00:17:20.098 --> 00:17:22.638
It doesn't matter. He doesn't even treat you like his own son.

284
00:17:23.737 --> 00:17:24.808
Listen to me carefully.

285
00:17:25.407 --> 00:17:27.677
Not all biological fathers deserve to be fathers.

286
00:17:27.808 --> 00:17:29.808
So just forget it, and ignore him. Just like he does to you.

287
00:17:33.878 --> 00:17:35.177
I want to ignore him.

288
00:17:37.348 --> 00:17:39.048
But I seriously want to kill him,

289
00:17:40.618 --> 00:17:41.717
so I can't.

290
00:17:45.288 --> 00:17:47.028
Even I want to kill him,

291
00:17:47.997 --> 00:17:49.128
so I'm sure it'll be worse for you.

292
00:17:51.167 --> 00:17:54.068
Let's catch him together. I'll help you.

293
00:17:54.798 --> 00:17:55.838
I'll take care of it myself.

294
00:17:55.838 --> 00:17:57.467
Were you not listening to me?

295
00:17:57.667 --> 00:17:59.868
I'm not trying to catch him because of you.

296
00:18:00.138 --> 00:18:01.878
I want to kill him too.

297
00:18:02.538 --> 00:18:04.548
He's the one who killed my dad.

298
00:18:05.548 --> 00:18:08.247
I also have a reason to catch him and lock him up.

299
00:18:12.987 --> 00:18:14.118
It's too dangerous.

300
00:18:14.818 --> 00:18:16.187
It's just as dangerous for you.

301
00:18:22.157 --> 00:18:23.157
Help me.

302
00:18:27.368 --> 00:18:29.268
Help me lock Lee Kwang Ho up...

303
00:18:30.437 --> 00:18:32.707
so that I can take revenge on behalf of my dad.

304
00:18:40.278 --> 00:18:41.278
Okay.

305
00:18:45.388 --> 00:18:46.717
You promised, okay?

306
00:18:47.858 --> 00:18:50.257
And stop ignoring me from now on.

307
00:18:50.628 --> 00:18:52.187
That's being pathetic.

308
00:18:54.598 --> 00:18:56.927
Okay. I won't.

309
00:18:59.528 --> 00:19:02.268
How's Detective Kang? Is he okay now?

310
00:19:14.018 --> 00:19:15.247
Hey, you're here.

311
00:19:18.118 --> 00:19:19.187
You must be tired.

312
00:19:19.348 --> 00:19:20.717
No, I'm fine.

313
00:19:20.717 --> 00:19:23.457
- Did you eat? - Yes, I did.

314
00:19:23.957 --> 00:19:26.598
I need to go to the National Police Agency.

315
00:19:26.598 --> 00:19:28.727
So please stay here for a while.

316
00:19:29.657 --> 00:19:32.667
I'll be right back. My team members might come,

317
00:19:32.667 --> 00:19:34.868
so please stay here at least until then.

318
00:19:34.868 --> 00:19:36.937
- I'll be right back. - Okay.

319
00:20:40.868 --> 00:20:42.368
Gosh, I'm so glad to see you.

320
00:20:44.868 --> 00:20:46.838
We might become best friends soon.

321
00:20:47.578 --> 00:20:50.947
How much of Detective Kang's information did you gather?

322
00:20:51.647 --> 00:20:54.548
Why do you always get straight to the point?

323
00:20:55.348 --> 00:20:58.518
You should know how to joke around a little...

324
00:20:58.518 --> 00:21:00.088
and relax.

325
00:21:00.088 --> 00:21:01.217
Do you have enough...

326
00:21:01.818 --> 00:21:03.388
to catch Lee Kwang Ho?

327
00:21:04.588 --> 00:21:05.628
Not yet.

328
00:21:06.628 --> 00:21:09.528
I can see where the money's going.

329
00:21:14.897 --> 00:21:17.707
But I can't seem to find who this person is.

330
00:21:18.207 --> 00:21:20.707
Every time he makes a bank account under someone else's name,

331
00:21:20.707 --> 00:21:22.538
this guy's name pops up.

332
00:21:25.048 --> 00:21:26.647
But I can't get a grasp of who he is.

333
00:21:31.018 --> 00:21:34.157
Detective Kang would've been able to find him right away.

334
00:21:35.987 --> 00:21:37.628
- Mr. Kang... - I already heard.

335
00:21:38.457 --> 00:21:40.427
I called him earlier because of this.

336
00:21:41.298 --> 00:21:43.058
But Inspector Park picked up instead.

337
00:21:45.298 --> 00:21:49.368
He needs to wake up quickly for my sake.

338
00:21:55.608 --> 00:21:57.207
Do you want to get Lee Kwang Ho fast?

339
00:21:58.108 --> 00:22:00.447
Then try to shake Chairwoman Gook up.

340
00:22:00.917 --> 00:22:04.118
The testimony I got from Jang Pil Sung is sloppy,

341
00:22:04.118 --> 00:22:06.147
and these Macao transaction records...

342
00:22:07.157 --> 00:22:09.457
can't be investigated without Detective Kang.

343
00:22:09.457 --> 00:22:10.558
Right now...

344
00:22:11.927 --> 00:22:14.798
Chairwoman Gook is the quickest solution.

345
00:22:15.028 --> 00:22:18.298
Haven't you been working with Chairwoman Gook?

346
00:22:20.467 --> 00:22:23.638
Well, when we found the remains,

347
00:22:24.167 --> 00:22:26.638
she seemed like she was going to confess everything.

348
00:22:26.638 --> 00:22:29.308
But now she's quiet like she's been tied down.

349
00:22:31.407 --> 00:22:34.647
Don't just stand there.

350
00:22:36.278 --> 00:22:38.717
Go and see what's going on.

351
00:22:39.318 --> 00:22:42.388
Let me know if it looks like she'd blow something up.

352
00:22:44.927 --> 00:22:48.157
The bomb explodes best when a prosecutor is involved.

353
00:22:49.497 --> 00:22:50.628
Got it?

354
00:22:54.997 --> 00:22:56.608
He'd never tell, right?

355
00:22:57.467 --> 00:22:58.568
Probably not.

356
00:22:59.977 --> 00:23:02.437
If he tells, it's attempted murder. If he doesn't, it's an accident.

357
00:23:03.308 --> 00:23:04.778
He wouldn't tell easily.

358
00:23:06.947 --> 00:23:08.048
I...

359
00:23:08.917 --> 00:23:11.447
told Officer Oh...

360
00:23:13.088 --> 00:23:14.388
that it was Lee Kwang Ho.

361
00:23:15.487 --> 00:23:16.888
Was he here?

362
00:23:17.828 --> 00:23:21.157
Yes. He came and beat General Manager Kwak up.

363
00:23:24.268 --> 00:23:25.727
Of course.

364
00:23:27.268 --> 00:23:30.007
Still, he must've been hurt.

365
00:23:30.907 --> 00:23:33.437
Because he found out that his real father...

366
00:23:33.437 --> 00:23:35.638
ordered someone to kill him.

367
00:23:36.338 --> 00:23:38.207
He's not even human.

368
00:23:38.608 --> 00:23:40.647
Regardless of the situation, Jong Sam is still his son.

369
00:23:41.278 --> 00:23:42.548
That scumbag.

370
00:23:48.457 --> 00:23:50.788
You can't come in here as you please.

371
00:23:51.828 --> 00:23:53.397
Where's security?

372
00:23:53.828 --> 00:23:57.268
Is coming to a police agency such a difficult thing to do?

373
00:23:57.268 --> 00:23:58.628
No, it's not.

374
00:23:58.828 --> 00:24:01.838
But you're the suspect of Prosecutor Joo's murder.

375
00:24:02.368 --> 00:24:03.638
Are you here to confess?

376
00:24:04.308 --> 00:24:05.507
Why are you here?

377
00:24:07.108 --> 00:24:09.477
- General Manager Kwak. - What about him?

378
00:24:09.878 --> 00:24:12.278
Won't you get his statement?

379
00:24:12.477 --> 00:24:13.977
We'll take care of that.

380
00:24:14.947 --> 00:24:17.647
That's your wishful thinking.

381
00:24:19.848 --> 00:24:23.088
You can record it. Just give me five minutes.

382
00:24:36.467 --> 00:24:38.167
I'll be frank.

383
00:24:38.707 --> 00:24:40.677
Neither the chief director of NIS nor I...

384
00:24:41.177 --> 00:24:42.707
can save you.

385
00:24:43.348 --> 00:24:44.477
Pardon?

386
00:24:44.947 --> 00:24:46.818
The chief director washed his hands of this matter,

387
00:24:47.318 --> 00:24:48.378
and I...

388
00:24:49.217 --> 00:24:51.318
need to get Lee Kwang Ho first.

389
00:24:52.917 --> 00:24:56.757
Chairwoman Gook. Are you discarding me?

390
00:24:57.657 --> 00:25:00.598
No. I'm just doing what I've always done.

391
00:25:02.657 --> 00:25:05.197
Making a sacrifice for the great cause.

392
00:25:05.197 --> 00:25:06.568
That's our inviolable rule.

393
00:25:12.368 --> 00:25:13.838
What do you want from me?

394
00:25:14.078 --> 00:25:15.608
Tell the truth.

395
00:25:16.608 --> 00:25:19.177
Say that Lee Kwang Ho instigated murder.

396
00:25:25.487 --> 00:25:26.717
What if I won't?

397
00:25:26.987 --> 00:25:30.588
I'll have to reveal how much you've done...

398
00:25:30.828 --> 00:25:34.298
for the great cause over the years.

399
00:25:34.497 --> 00:25:36.568
You'll get hurt too.

400
00:25:36.927 --> 00:25:39.227
I wouldn't have come all the way here without knowing that.

401
00:25:46.237 --> 00:25:47.707
Just tell the facts.

402
00:25:47.707 --> 00:25:49.108
(Recording)

403
00:25:49.308 --> 00:25:51.548
Say what Lee Kwang Ho ordered you to do.

404
00:25:52.447 --> 00:25:55.848
You can confess all the details to the officers here.

405
00:26:00.088 --> 00:26:01.318
What about Assistant Manager Ki?

406
00:26:01.888 --> 00:26:05.227
Assistant Manager Ki? Whatever you wish.

407
00:26:08.997 --> 00:26:10.028
Okay.

408
00:26:10.028 --> 00:26:11.028
(Interrogation Room)

409
00:26:15.798 --> 00:26:17.338
Thanks for your cooperation.

410
00:26:17.507 --> 00:26:19.638
You can go in and get his confession.

411
00:26:20.078 --> 00:26:22.177
You make the police look so incompetent.

412
00:26:22.578 --> 00:26:24.308
The police isn't incompetent.

413
00:26:25.247 --> 00:26:27.078
The law...

414
00:26:27.078 --> 00:26:28.717
and the principle are.

415
00:26:29.717 --> 00:26:32.647
The law and the principle can be ignored...

416
00:26:32.647 --> 00:26:34.558
if you have power and money.

417
00:26:34.558 --> 00:26:37.028
Those times are over already.

418
00:26:37.657 --> 00:26:41.227
So you will be going to jail...

419
00:26:41.697 --> 00:26:43.528
following the law and the principle.

420
00:26:50.538 --> 00:26:51.638
Who is this?

421
00:26:59.707 --> 00:27:01.647
(Erim Food)

422
00:27:20.068 --> 00:27:22.737
Good. You're here. Follow me.

423
00:27:33.778 --> 00:27:37.348
This is a document regarding the bribe given to Manager Lee...

424
00:27:37.348 --> 00:27:39.048
from the NIS.

425
00:27:39.318 --> 00:27:42.388
And this is a document regarding corporate slush funds.

426
00:27:42.388 --> 00:27:43.558
(Slush Fund Document)

427
00:27:43.687 --> 00:27:45.687
Combined with my testimony,

428
00:27:46.328 --> 00:27:48.457
the rumors will become facts.

429
00:27:48.457 --> 00:27:51.727
So you can charge him for bribery without a problem.

430
00:27:51.727 --> 00:27:54.497
What about the other crimes?

431
00:27:54.638 --> 00:27:56.737
Once the court turns its back on Manager Lee,

432
00:27:56.907 --> 00:27:59.768
the Odong Blowfish House murder case...

433
00:28:00.338 --> 00:28:02.707
and Chairman Jin's murder case...

434
00:28:02.707 --> 00:28:04.447
will all be reinvested.

435
00:28:04.947 --> 00:28:07.217
The statute of limitations is a problem.

436
00:28:07.618 --> 00:28:10.717
Still, his morality will get a huge blow.

437
00:28:11.647 --> 00:28:12.818
Plus,

438
00:28:13.618 --> 00:28:17.457
I have General Manager Kwak's testimony that...

439
00:28:17.457 --> 00:28:18.987
he instigated your murder.

440
00:28:22.328 --> 00:28:25.427
Let's release the 100-million-dollar slush funds first.

441
00:28:27.497 --> 00:28:29.838
Chairwoman Gook. I'll take care of him.

442
00:28:31.207 --> 00:28:33.578
I guess I came here too late.

443
00:28:34.937 --> 00:28:36.477
But not too late.

444
00:28:37.048 --> 00:28:38.808
Everything I need is still here.

445
00:28:41.518 --> 00:28:43.018
What are you doing?

446
00:28:43.687 --> 00:28:45.217
Can't you see what's going on?

447
00:28:50.588 --> 00:28:51.727
What are you doing?

448
00:28:51.727 --> 00:28:53.628
I think these people already know...

449
00:28:53.727 --> 00:28:55.227
how the table has turned.

450
00:28:55.227 --> 00:28:57.068
Are you really going to do this?

451
00:28:57.927 --> 00:29:00.598
The employees know very well...

452
00:29:00.598 --> 00:29:02.197
who the real owner of this company is.

453
00:29:03.138 --> 00:29:05.768
I'll get going now.

454
00:29:09.838 --> 00:29:10.977
Stop right there, An Tae Jung.

455
00:29:17.217 --> 00:29:19.747
Everyone get out. You too.

456
00:29:32.028 --> 00:29:33.638
Put those down.

457
00:29:34.338 --> 00:29:37.608
Go tell Lee Kwang Ho that everything is over.

458
00:29:39.308 --> 00:29:40.378
Assistant Manager Ki.

459
00:29:40.578 --> 00:29:42.878
What are you doing? Escort this man out.

460
00:29:43.407 --> 00:29:44.447
Okay.

461
00:30:29.157 --> 00:30:30.227
Did you get a good look?

462
00:30:32.427 --> 00:30:33.757
Who knows?

463
00:30:33.897 --> 00:30:36.358
You might really want to kill someone.

464
00:30:47.007 --> 00:30:49.947
Manager Lee can never know about what happened.

465
00:30:50.147 --> 00:30:52.747
- Yes, sir. - Chairwoman Gook has gone berserk.

466
00:30:53.647 --> 00:30:55.818
We need to persuade Kim Jong Sam.

467
00:31:01.588 --> 00:31:04.257
Sign this. It's over.

468
00:31:05.257 --> 00:31:07.328
I guess she has no sense of honor.

469
00:31:07.328 --> 00:31:10.598
All the frustration I had has been washed away.

470
00:31:10.598 --> 00:31:13.098
I feel bad for you.

471
00:31:14.838 --> 00:31:16.138
Be quiet.

472
00:31:16.768 --> 00:31:19.937
Okay. I will if you sign with your thumbprint here.

473
00:31:33.088 --> 00:31:34.457
Okay.

474
00:31:36.417 --> 00:31:37.558
What are you doing?

475
00:31:37.927 --> 00:31:39.558
It's time for a tour of your holding cell.

476
00:31:56.682 --> 00:31:59.682
(Episode 38 will air shortly.)
