1
00:00:06.923 --> 00:00:09.190
By the way, Theresa,

2
00:00:11.695 --> 00:00:14.700
I'm not sure if it's okay for me to date you,

3
00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:18.300
I thought your husband wouldn't like it,

4
00:00:18.301 --> 00:00:21.110
You don't need to worry about it,

5
00:00:21.171 --> 00:00:22.510
Actually,,,

6
00:00:23.073 --> 00:00:25.310
I got a divorce five years ago,

7
00:00:26.443 --> 00:00:28.210
Did you live alone until now?

8
00:00:28.211 --> 00:00:30.350
Why didn't you meet someone better?

9
00:00:30.947 --> 00:00:34.220
I did, I had a relationship until recently,

10
00:00:34.451 --> 00:00:37.560
I see, What kind of man was he?

11
00:00:37.587 --> 00:00:39.460
A physiatrist,

12
00:00:39.623 --> 00:00:42.390
I was actually forced,,,

13
00:00:42.392 --> 00:00:43.960
to date someone last year,

14
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.030
Goodness, Really? What kind of woman was she?

15
00:00:47.764 --> 00:00:49.930
She got a divorce five years ago,

16
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:52.030
She was tall and had big eyes,

17
00:00:52.035 --> 00:00:54.370
She had long legs, She was a divorced woman,

18
00:00:55.372 --> 00:00:58.140
She must've been very beautiful,

19
00:00:58.842 --> 00:01:01.310
She sometimes sang as a hobby,

20
00:01:01.812 --> 00:01:03.880
That was very attractive,

21
00:01:04.214 --> 00:01:06.710
He was handsome and well-mannered,

22
00:01:06.716 --> 00:01:09.420
He was gentle and had a lot of money,

23
00:01:10.253 --> 00:01:14.190
Really? He must've been a very good man,

24
00:01:15.158 --> 00:01:17.730
He knew how to love a woman,

25
00:01:18.695 --> 00:01:21.060
But the thing is,,,

26
00:01:21.064 --> 00:01:23.760
he bought me a car a month after we met,

27
00:01:23.767 --> 00:01:25.600
What? A car?

28
00:01:25.735 --> 00:01:29.740
Is it popular for men these days to buy a car for women?

29
00:01:30.307 --> 00:01:31.610
But,,,

30
00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:34.880
wasn't she the one for you?

31
00:01:35.212 --> 00:01:38.980
Well, I feel bad to say this about the woman I broke up with,

32
00:01:39.983 --> 00:01:41.490
but in short,

33
00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:43.760
she was a swindler,

34
00:01:46.156 --> 00:01:47.590
A swindler?

35
00:01:48.658 --> 00:01:52.060
It sounds like his conditions were more than good enough,

36
00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.870
Why didn't you marry him?

37
00:01:54.598 --> 00:01:55.900
I'm not sure,

38
00:01:56.466 --> 00:01:59.940
I feel bad to say this about the man I broke up with,

39
00:02:01.805 --> 00:02:03.540
but he was,,,

40
00:02:04.174 --> 00:02:06.470
such a bad swindler,

41
00:02:06.476 --> 00:02:09.310
What? A swindler?

42
00:02:10.347 --> 00:02:12.050
What did he do to you?

43
00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:14.310
I received,,,

44
00:02:14.317 --> 00:02:16.820
a building in Sinsa-dong as alimony when I got a divorce,

45
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.920
I think that attracted him to me,

46
00:02:20.157 --> 00:02:22.890
After getting in trouble with that man,

47
00:02:23.026 --> 00:02:25.230
I became afraid to meet people,

48
00:02:27.063 --> 00:02:29.700
That must have been hard for you,

49
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.900
How could a man rip off,,,

50
00:02:32.903 --> 00:02:35.140
a delicate woman?

51
00:02:35.238 --> 00:02:39.080
I don't know who he is, but if I get to meet him,

52
00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:42.680
I'll make sure that it's his last day on Earth,

53
00:02:45.448 --> 00:02:46.750
Why?

54
00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:48.990
Are you upset about that?

55
00:02:50.687 --> 00:02:53.160
I'm just sorry for my pathetic love,

56
00:02:54.124 --> 00:02:56.330
Things always go wrong,

57
00:02:57.027 --> 00:02:58.120
Go wrong?

58
00:02:58.128 --> 00:02:59.960
I really hate you,

59
00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.970
How happy would I be now if you had noticed,,,

60
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.970
my feelings toward you when we were students?

61
00:03:06.203 --> 00:03:08.800
Theresa,

62
00:03:08.805 --> 00:03:13.550
But I'm thankful for finding you,

63
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.910
Being rich isn't important,

64
00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:17.880
I have no meaning in life,

65
00:03:19.683 --> 00:03:23.460
Whenever I was lonely, I would imagine,,,

66
00:03:24.421 --> 00:03:28.430
how happy I would be if I married you,

67
00:03:31.428 --> 00:03:33.430
I'm so silly,

68
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.630
I need to wash my hands,

69
00:03:50.046 --> 00:03:51.950
She thinks,,,

70
00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:54.690
that she would have been happy if she had married me?

71
00:03:57.153 --> 00:04:02.990
- Mid pleasures and palaces - Mid pleasures and palaces

72
00:04:02.993 --> 00:04:08.560
- though we may roam - though we may roam

73
00:04:08.565 --> 00:04:14.900
- Be it ever so humble, - Be it ever so humble,

74
00:04:14.904 --> 00:04:19.780
- there's no place like home - there's no place like home

75
00:04:20.844 --> 00:04:23.010
Honey, you're home,

76
00:04:23.013 --> 00:04:25.620
What are you doing?

77
00:04:26.916 --> 00:04:29.280
Don't you know that the neighbors will complain,,,

78
00:04:29.286 --> 00:04:31.320
if you play piano late at night?

79
00:04:31.321 --> 00:04:33.450
But we can't let today go by without celebrating,

80
00:04:33.456 --> 00:04:34.890
There's something to celebrate,

81
00:04:34.891 --> 00:04:37.530
Celebrate? Is it someone's birthday?

82
00:04:38.328 --> 00:04:40.590
So Won, bring it to your dad,

83
00:04:40.597 --> 00:04:41.830
Yes, Mom,

84
00:04:41.831 --> 00:04:43.100
Please sit down,

85
00:04:54.778 --> 00:04:57.980
(Marriage Graduation Contract)

86
00:04:57.981 --> 00:04:59.210
Marriage graduation?

87
00:04:59.215 --> 00:05:02.080
Do you want a marriage graduation?

88
00:05:02.085 --> 00:05:03.290
Yes,

89
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.530
You worked hard to support our family until now,

90
00:05:07.891 --> 00:05:11.220
I'll earn money by teaching piano,

91
00:05:11.227 --> 00:05:14.600
Enjoy your freedom and do whatever you want to do,

92
00:05:14.898 --> 00:05:17.660
That's right, That's why we found,,,

93
00:05:17.667 --> 00:05:20.210
your first love who used to go to a teachers college,

94
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.710
My first love?

95
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.770
Did you know about this?

96
00:05:25.775 --> 00:05:27.350
Of course,

97
00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:31.580
I'm ready to share you with others,

98
00:05:31.581 --> 00:05:33.420
We have to share what is good,

99
00:05:34.217 --> 00:05:35.490
Sister?

100
00:05:35.885 --> 00:05:37.720
- Madam? - Madam?

101
00:05:41.024 --> 00:05:42.160
Oh, my,

102
00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.600
Shin Mo, it's been a long time,

103
00:05:46.663 --> 00:05:49.830
Hong Young Hye, what is happening?

104
00:05:50.533 --> 00:05:53.330
Honey, this isn't right,

105
00:05:53.336 --> 00:05:55.530
She must have a family,

106
00:05:55.538 --> 00:05:57.640
I got a divorce five years ago,

107
00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.610
He was just a smooth talker who bought me a car,

108
00:06:03.513 --> 00:06:08.450
I should've married an energetic man like you,

109
00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:10.150
I was stupid,

110
00:06:10.653 --> 00:06:14.360
This isn't right,

111
00:06:15.091 --> 00:06:16.790
Gosh,

112
00:06:20.663 --> 00:06:23.070
It's time to turn my life around,

113
00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.900
Hong Young Hye,

114
00:06:25.668 --> 00:06:28.770
See?

115
00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:31.780
I'm still good,

116
00:06:33.276 --> 00:06:39.050
Theresa has good taste in men,

117
00:06:43.887 --> 00:06:46.460
Oh, my goodness,

118
00:06:47.323 --> 00:06:50.800
I'm so moved, my heart is exploding,

119
00:06:52.028 --> 00:06:55.030
Isn't the first time that you drove for me?

120
00:06:55.265 --> 00:06:58.400
It's nice to go for a drive with you,

121
00:06:58.401 --> 00:07:00.400
In the past,

122
00:07:00.403 --> 00:07:03.770
you would just go back to the hospital,

123
00:07:03.773 --> 00:07:06.500
I guess you're starting to care for me now,

124
00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:10.110
I need to repay you for a long time for letting us reunite,

125
00:07:11.648 --> 00:07:12.920
So Won,

126
00:07:13.016 --> 00:07:16.720
What is the most important thing for you?

127
00:07:16.886 --> 00:07:18.090
Well,,,

128
00:07:18.922 --> 00:07:20.890
In the past, I wanted to earn a lot of money,,,

129
00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:22.590
and become famous,

130
00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:25.100
I know what's important now,

131
00:07:25.728 --> 00:07:29.030
Making the woman he loves the happiest,,,

132
00:07:29.032 --> 00:07:30.600
is a man's job,

133
00:07:31.401 --> 00:07:33.830
That's my goal in life,

134
00:07:33.837 --> 00:07:36.530
Oh, my goodness,

135
00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:39.640
You're the best,

136
00:07:39.642 --> 00:07:41.780
It's a pity that I'm the only person to hear this,

137
00:07:42.011 --> 00:07:44.420
That's right, What you said is right,

138
00:07:44.848 --> 00:07:49.090
From my experience, everything else is useless,

139
00:07:49.652 --> 00:07:51.150
Married couples fight,,,

140
00:07:51.154 --> 00:07:54.020
because of their problems and want to separate,

141
00:07:54.023 --> 00:07:57.860
70 percent say that they can't live with each other because of money,

142
00:07:57.894 --> 00:07:59.520
That's not true,

143
00:07:59.529 --> 00:08:02.900
The most important thing is love between a couple,

144
00:08:03.333 --> 00:08:07.840
I have almost everything I need,,,

145
00:08:08.204 --> 00:08:09.840
except one thing,

146
00:08:10.073 --> 00:08:12.980
The only thing I never had was,,,

147
00:08:13.142 --> 00:08:15.110
a loving husband,

148
00:08:15.278 --> 00:08:19.680
I hope that you, Yeon Ju, and Han Gyul live,,,

149
00:08:19.682 --> 00:08:23.090
a happy life for me,,,

150
00:08:23.286 --> 00:08:25.290
and resolve my sorrow,

151
00:08:25.522 --> 00:08:28.090
Yes, don't worry,

152
00:08:28.892 --> 00:08:31.960
And tonight,

153
00:08:31.961 --> 00:08:35.660
one couple is going to come to an end,

154
00:08:35.665 --> 00:08:37.100
Coming soon,

155
00:08:40.403 --> 00:08:42.040
Who are they?

156
00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:47.170
Go have a meal tonight,

157
00:08:47.176 --> 00:08:50.280
Relieve your stress tonight,

158
00:08:52.148 --> 00:08:56.550
Your mother has to go to 7080 tonight,

159
00:09:15.171 --> 00:09:16.900
Butter Story Season 5,

160
00:09:16.906 --> 00:09:18.780
There's no betting limit,

161
00:09:20.743 --> 00:09:23.820
I really want to play a game,

162
00:09:25.048 --> 00:09:27.020
But I don't have any money,

163
00:09:56.212 --> 00:09:59.550
How did she scam you?

164
00:10:00.516 --> 00:10:02.390
It started with a watch,

165
00:10:02.919 --> 00:10:04.150
A watch?

166
00:10:04.153 --> 00:10:06.460
She celebrated a lot of anniversaries,

167
00:10:07.023 --> 00:10:09.690
Birthdays, 100th day anniversary, White Day,

168
00:10:09.692 --> 00:10:11.000
and Christmas,

169
00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.830
Anyway, she liked getting presents,

170
00:10:13.863 --> 00:10:17.770
That's not really scamming, It's more of a preference,

171
00:10:18.034 --> 00:10:21.910
I was happy, and it was rewarding when the presents made her happy,

172
00:10:22.105 --> 00:10:26.080
The problem was that she sold those presents for cash,

173
00:10:26.509 --> 00:10:27.680
What?

174
00:10:28.811 --> 00:10:32.410
My gosh, could it have been that she was struggling?

175
00:10:32.415 --> 00:10:33.750
Not at all,

176
00:10:34.417 --> 00:10:37.160
Later on, I found out that she got a 10-story building,,,

177
00:10:37.186 --> 00:10:39.760
in Sinsa-dong for alimony,

178
00:10:39.922 --> 00:10:43.660
My goodness, Then why did she do such a thing?

179
00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:46.200
She told me that she could never meet me on weekends,

180
00:10:46.262 --> 00:10:47.900
At first, I didn't think much of it,

181
00:10:48.031 --> 00:10:52.670
But one day, my insurance company called to verify the request,,,

182
00:10:52.735 --> 00:10:54.770
to mortgage the car I lent her for a loan,

183
00:10:54.904 --> 00:10:56.300
For what?

184
00:10:56.305 --> 00:10:59.510
She blew up all her money at the casino in Jeongseon,,,

185
00:10:59.776 --> 00:11:02.150
and tried to play one more round after pawning the car,

186
00:11:02.378 --> 00:11:03.820
My goodness,

187
00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:05.920
She was a lost cause,

188
00:11:06.382 --> 00:11:09.150
I'm sure she's probably looking for a guy,,,

189
00:11:09.152 --> 00:11:11.120
who can be her banker,

190
00:11:12.922 --> 00:11:16.160
Shin Mo, do you know what today is?

191
00:11:16.759 --> 00:11:18.000
I'm not sure,

192
00:11:19.629 --> 00:11:21.770
Is it your birthday?

193
00:11:22.632 --> 00:11:25.770
My gosh, how did you know that?

194
00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:29.670
It happened to be my birthday,

195
00:11:29.806 --> 00:11:31.510
but I had no one to celebrate it with,

196
00:11:31.808 --> 00:11:34.310
I was about to cry because I was so lonely,

197
00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:36.910
It'd be great if you can celebrate it with me,

198
00:11:37.547 --> 00:11:40.520
Of course, That's not that hard,

199
00:11:41.484 --> 00:11:42.790
I'll celebrate it with you,

200
00:11:44.287 --> 00:11:45.560
Is there anything you want?

201
00:11:45.888 --> 00:11:48.190
Just tell me, I'll buy you a gift,

202
00:11:48.424 --> 00:11:50.030
A bouquet of flowers? A cake? What do you think?

203
00:11:50.159 --> 00:11:52.160
That's all right, Shin Mo,

204
00:11:52.161 --> 00:11:53.690
You're not well-off,

205
00:11:53.696 --> 00:11:56.130
Hey, why would you say that?

206
00:11:56.132 --> 00:11:57.660
I have a lot of money,

207
00:11:57.667 --> 00:11:59.060
Just tell me,

208
00:11:59.068 --> 00:12:00.810
What do you want? Tell me,

209
00:12:01.104 --> 00:12:02.670
I said I don't want anything,

210
00:12:03.139 --> 00:12:06.180
Spending time with you like this is a present to me,

211
00:12:07.376 --> 00:12:09.950
Shin Mo, do you want to get going and sing a few songs?

212
00:12:10.747 --> 00:12:12.080
What time is it?

213
00:12:13.282 --> 00:12:16.020
My gosh, why is this cracked?

214
00:12:17.653 --> 00:12:19.260
What? What is it?

215
00:12:21.858 --> 00:12:23.560
How,,,

216
00:12:23.793 --> 00:12:26.760
My gosh, I have a bad feeling about this,

217
00:12:27.897 --> 00:12:29.870
This is my favorite watch,

218
00:12:30.166 --> 00:12:32.170
What should I do?

219
00:12:38.174 --> 00:12:40.180
- What am I going to do? - Okay,

220
00:12:41.043 --> 00:12:42.450
Let's get out of here,

221
00:12:43.146 --> 00:12:44.420
I will,,,

222
00:12:45.181 --> 00:12:47.020
buy you a new one for your present,

223
00:12:47.283 --> 00:12:48.550
I'll buy you one, Let's go,

224
00:12:49.919 --> 00:12:51.120
Let's go,

225
00:12:55.258 --> 00:12:57.060
This is so pretty,

226
00:12:57.894 --> 00:12:59.600
I love it,

227
00:12:59.629 --> 00:13:01.860
Shin Mo, you're really buying me this for my birthday, right?

228
00:13:01.864 --> 00:13:03.160
Of course, you got it,

229
00:13:03.166 --> 00:13:06.540
It's your birthday, How could I possibly ignore it?

230
00:13:09.138 --> 00:13:11.400
Then I will think about you,,,

231
00:13:11.407 --> 00:13:13.880
every time I look at my watch,

232
00:13:14.143 --> 00:13:15.810
What a beauty,

233
00:13:16.379 --> 00:13:18.320
Goodness, you're acting like a kid,

234
00:13:19.415 --> 00:13:20.790
It's just a watch,

235
00:13:22.151 --> 00:13:23.490
How much is it?

236
00:13:23.619 --> 00:13:25.390
It's 2,480 dollars, sir,

237
00:13:29.492 --> 00:13:30.660
How much?

238
00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:32.500
It's 2,480 dollars, sir,

239
00:13:32.562 --> 00:13:33.930
How could a watch be so expensive?

240
00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:37.400
This watch is a new product for 2018,

241
00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:41.040
As you can see, it's lined with white crystals and is luxurious,

242
00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:43.810
Even if that's the case, it's just a watch,

243
00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:45.580
- Shin Mo, what's wrong with you? - Sorry?

244
00:13:45.908 --> 00:13:47.450
I mean,,,

245
00:13:47.777 --> 00:13:49.050
I was just,,,

246
00:13:49.512 --> 00:13:53.150
Is there another watch you like?

247
00:13:54.183 --> 00:13:56.050
Do you have a pretty electronic watch?

248
00:13:56.052 --> 00:13:58.560
No, I don't want that, This is the prettiest,

249
00:13:58.621 --> 00:14:00.290
Why are you acting like this?

250
00:14:00.656 --> 00:14:03.660
It's just that,,, I don't think,,,

251
00:14:04.894 --> 00:14:06.130
I got it,

252
00:14:06.762 --> 00:14:10.230
I'm all right, Buy me a birthday gift some other time,,,

253
00:14:10.233 --> 00:14:11.640
when you have money,

254
00:14:12.802 --> 00:14:16.040
- Let's just leave, - Should we? Okay,

255
00:14:17.139 --> 00:14:18.380
Wait,

256
00:14:21.177 --> 00:14:23.810
But since I'm really sad to leave it behind,

257
00:14:23.813 --> 00:14:25.420
let me wear it one last time,

258
00:14:25.548 --> 00:14:27.550
- Can I do that? - Of course,

259
00:14:29.952 --> 00:14:31.420
This is so beautiful,

260
00:14:35.157 --> 00:14:38.120
Watch, although it was brief,

261
00:14:38.127 --> 00:14:41.270
I was so happy because he almost bought you for me,

262
00:14:43.266 --> 00:14:45.400
I'm very sad to let you go,

263
00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:51.910
You do monthly installments, right?

264
00:14:51.941 --> 00:14:53.180
Yes,

265
00:14:55.278 --> 00:14:57.050
Thank you, Shin Mo!

266
00:14:59.015 --> 00:15:00.220
How beautiful,

267
00:15:16.165 --> 00:15:18.300
I know all about Han Gyul's birth,

268
00:15:18.401 --> 00:15:21.810
Unless you want to be humiliated in the kindergarten, do as I say,

269
00:15:24.774 --> 00:15:26.810
Who did this?

270
00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:29.650
And do what? What am I supposed to do?

271
00:15:34.517 --> 00:15:36.990
(Restricted Caller ID)

272
00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.430
Hello?

273
00:15:45.895 --> 00:15:47.160
Ms, Ha Yeon Ju?

274
00:15:48.397 --> 00:15:51.170
This is she, Who is this?

275
00:15:57.673 --> 00:15:58.910
I told you already,

276
00:15:59.342 --> 00:16:02.010
I'm someone who knows a lot about Han Gyul,

277
00:16:02.011 --> 00:16:03.380
whom you claim to have given birth to,

278
00:16:03.512 --> 00:16:05.180
What nonsense are you talking about?

279
00:16:05.448 --> 00:16:08.290
I don't know what it is that you know, but you're mistaken,

280
00:16:08.384 --> 00:16:10.920
Han Gyul is a daughter I gave birth to!

281
00:16:11.253 --> 00:16:13.820
Is that so? Okay,

282
00:16:14.023 --> 00:16:17.030
Then I can spread the news to the kindergarten that,,,

283
00:16:17.259 --> 00:16:19.060
your husband brought her out of wedlock, right?

284
00:16:19.695 --> 00:16:20.930
I'm hanging up now,

285
00:16:21.364 --> 00:16:22.970
Wait, Hold on,

286
00:16:23.799 --> 00:16:25.400
What is it that you want?

287
00:16:25.868 --> 00:16:27.810
Why are you doing this to me?

288
00:16:27.903 --> 00:16:30.410
Put together 69,000 dollars by tomorrow,

289
00:16:30.906 --> 00:16:33.240
That shouldn't take long for you to put together, correct?

290
00:16:35.011 --> 00:16:37.180
Hello? Hello?

291
00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:46.160
69,000 dollars?

292
00:16:48.657 --> 00:16:49.930
Who is this?

293
00:16:53.529 --> 00:16:55.170
Let's do this again some other time,

294
00:17:02.171 --> 00:17:04.510
What are you staring at?

295
00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:05.670
Was there a ghost?

296
00:17:05.674 --> 00:17:07.240
Here comes a ghost!

297
00:17:07.777 --> 00:17:09.010
No,

298
00:17:09.412 --> 00:17:10.710
Why don't you go inside first?

299
00:17:10.713 --> 00:17:12.610
I'll get some medicine for Han Gyul's cold,

300
00:17:12.615 --> 00:17:14.450
Okay, Hurry back,

301
00:17:36.806 --> 00:17:40.040
If you tell your mom that you saw me,

302
00:17:40.242 --> 00:17:43.010
I'm going to take you away again, Do you understand?

303
00:17:43.412 --> 00:17:46.140
No! No, no!

304
00:17:46.148 --> 00:17:49.050
I don't want to! No!

305
00:17:49.051 --> 00:17:51.560
- No! No,,, - Han Gyul, Han Gyul,

306
00:17:53.522 --> 00:17:55.990
What's wrong? Did you have a nightmare?

307
00:18:00.863 --> 00:18:02.800
It's all right, It's okay,

308
00:18:02.932 --> 00:18:06.400
Don't be scared, Mommy and Daddy are right here for you,

309
00:18:06.402 --> 00:18:08.370
Nothing will happen, all right?

310
00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:15.280
Han Gyul, let me ask you a question,

311
00:18:16.212 --> 00:18:18.250
Did you see anyone,,,

312
00:18:18.714 --> 00:18:21.190
who seemed strange at the kindergarten?

313
00:18:22.651 --> 00:18:27.490
You've never seen someone from your old life,,,

314
00:18:27.756 --> 00:18:29.760
before you came to live with Dad?

315
00:18:31.794 --> 00:18:33.360
If you have,

316
00:18:33.362 --> 00:18:35.970
you must tell me the truth,

317
00:18:36.899 --> 00:18:38.070
Have you seen anyone?

318
00:18:38.834 --> 00:18:42.110
If you tell your mom that you saw me,

319
00:18:42.338 --> 00:18:43.810
I'm going to take you away again,

320
00:18:46.108 --> 00:18:49.350
No, I haven't, I haven't seen anyone,

321
00:18:51.747 --> 00:18:53.020
Is that so?

322
00:18:54.049 --> 00:18:56.480
If you do see anyone from your old life,

323
00:18:56.485 --> 00:18:59.560
you must tell me no matter what, okay?

324
00:19:01.957 --> 00:19:03.230
Come here,

325
00:19:06.595 --> 00:19:08.970
I don't think Jung Su Mi has come back,

326
00:19:09.431 --> 00:19:11.240
Then who is behind this?

327
00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:15.810
What are you doing?

328
00:19:18.707 --> 00:19:20.780
Answer my question truthfully,

329
00:19:22.645 --> 00:19:23.850
Why are you here?

330
00:19:24.046 --> 00:19:25.740
What is it to you?

331
00:19:25.748 --> 00:19:27.380
This is a free country, I can go anywhere I want,

332
00:19:27.416 --> 00:19:29.050
Answer my question!

333
00:19:30.319 --> 00:19:32.360
I'm asking you why you are here!

334
00:19:32.421 --> 00:19:35.860
Are you saying that I can't come to this area?

335
00:19:36.292 --> 00:19:38.560
Why can't I? What's special about this place?

336
00:19:38.694 --> 00:19:40.330
Are you really that clueless?

337
00:19:40.362 --> 00:19:41.570
Yes, I am,

338
00:19:41.664 --> 00:19:45.240
It's me who's flustered running into you here,

339
00:19:46.001 --> 00:19:48.040
Seeing how you're all riled up,,,

340
00:19:48.571 --> 00:19:50.140
Do you live around here?

341
00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:52.170
What?

342
00:19:52.174 --> 00:19:53.580
It's obvious, isn't it?

343
00:19:53.809 --> 00:19:56.140
Aren't you shaking all over,,,

344
00:19:56.145 --> 00:19:58.080
because you think I'm here to meet Han Gyul?

345
00:19:59.648 --> 00:20:02.320
You can't answer my question, So what I asked is true,

346
00:20:02.751 --> 00:20:05.550
Since I'm here, why don't I see if,,,

347
00:20:05.554 --> 00:20:07.160
Han Gyul is doing well?

348
00:20:07.323 --> 00:20:09.550
There are a lot of stories on TV,,,

349
00:20:09.558 --> 00:20:12.300
about parents abusing their children,

350
00:20:12.962 --> 00:20:15.290
You've abandoned her for six years,

351
00:20:15.297 --> 00:20:17.300
I wonder if you're treating her well,

352
00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:19.540
Watch your mouth,

353
00:20:19.668 --> 00:20:21.930
Don't you remember what you did to her?

354
00:20:21.937 --> 00:20:24.840
You left her in some trashy room, How dare you come again!

355
00:20:25.574 --> 00:20:27.080
I'm warning you,

356
00:20:27.743 --> 00:20:30.280
I'll call the police,,,

357
00:20:30.479 --> 00:20:33.450
if you ever come here again,

358
00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:41.530
Gosh, I'm scared, I should get going,

359
00:20:42.391 --> 00:20:46.260
By the way, you should remember one thing,

360
00:20:46.862 --> 00:20:50.230
Nothing is free in life,

361
00:20:52.401 --> 00:20:53.740
Hold on,

362
00:20:56.672 --> 00:20:59.510
Has your sister been released from prison?

363
00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:06.680
I'm asking you,

364
00:21:07.349 --> 00:21:09.250
Is Jung Su Mi out?

365
00:21:09.652 --> 00:21:11.050
I don't know!

366
00:21:11.053 --> 00:21:13.380
I'm not so free to care about,,,

367
00:21:13.389 --> 00:21:15.460
a criminal sister,

368
00:21:15.624 --> 00:21:16.960
Are we done now?

369
00:21:33.742 --> 00:21:37.140
Oh, no, What should we do? Your fever's 37,5°C,

370
00:21:37.146 --> 00:21:40.320
We have to go to the hospital now,

371
00:21:40.683 --> 00:21:42.310
Mrs, Yang,

372
00:21:42.318 --> 00:21:45.750
You've raised a kid yourself, You should know this by now,

373
00:21:45.754 --> 00:21:48.990
It's rather normal for kids who are about seven,

374
00:21:48.991 --> 00:21:52.390
Do you mean she doesn't have fever?

375
00:21:52.394 --> 00:21:54.030
She doesn't,

376
00:21:54.163 --> 00:21:56.430
You don't know about temperatures,

377
00:21:56.432 --> 00:21:59.300
Why don't you measure yourself? I'll see for you,

378
00:21:59.301 --> 00:22:03.270
Go on, I'm having a headache,

379
00:22:06.375 --> 00:22:09.380
Goodness, 34,7°C?

380
00:22:09.845 --> 00:22:13.110
Gosh, There are people who have such low body temperatures,

381
00:22:13.115 --> 00:22:15.310
Isn't she about to die?

382
00:22:15.317 --> 00:22:16.850
What do you mean by dying?

383
00:22:16.852 --> 00:22:19.650
It means you're on an express train to the underworld,

384
00:22:19.655 --> 00:22:21.890
Body temperature tells how healthy you are,

385
00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:24.890
Your body temperature is so low that there could be some tumors,

386
00:22:24.893 --> 00:22:27.220
Or your thyroid is not functioning well that all of your body parts,,,

387
00:22:27.229 --> 00:22:29.530
are not working at all,

388
00:22:30.366 --> 00:22:32.970
Gosh, maybe you're already sick,

389
00:22:34.336 --> 00:22:37.470
Mrs, Yang, you should go for a checkup tomorrow,

390
00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:40.580
Yeon Ju, Yeon Ju,

391
00:22:41.143 --> 00:22:42.570
Yes, Mom?

392
00:22:42.578 --> 00:22:45.910
Can you bring the sewing machine from the basement?

393
00:22:45.914 --> 00:22:50.290
Mrs, Yang, the body temperature is 37 degrees Celsius now,

394
00:22:50.652 --> 00:22:54.730
I'll sew your mouth, Watch your words,

395
00:22:55.591 --> 00:22:58.460
Han Gyul, if you're not feeling sick,

396
00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:00.720
do you want to go to school today?

397
00:23:00.729 --> 00:23:04.570
No, I don't want to go to school, I'm sick,

398
00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:08.610
Catch her, She's pretending to be sick,

399
00:23:08.637 --> 00:23:11.170
I'm really sick!

400
00:23:11.173 --> 00:23:13.100
I don't have any energy!

401
00:23:13.108 --> 00:23:15.040
I can't even walk!

402
00:23:15.043 --> 00:23:17.110
Don't you deceive me, you little girl,

403
00:23:17.112 --> 00:23:21.590
You can even catch a cow with your loud voice and power,

404
00:23:21.683 --> 00:23:25.420
You have to finish the elementary school, at least,

405
00:23:25.421 --> 00:23:28.690
What will you do when you grow up if you skip school so much?

406
00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:31.890
I know you didn't go to school either,

407
00:23:31.894 --> 00:23:33.760
I'll grow up to be just like you,

408
00:23:33.762 --> 00:23:38.130
I'm successful now because I'm good at cooking,

409
00:23:38.133 --> 00:23:40.140
But you can't cook!

410
00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:43.810
Mom, stop fighting with a kid,

411
00:23:44.373 --> 00:23:47.240
Han Gyul, why don't you want to go to school?

412
00:23:47.242 --> 00:23:49.210
You don't like studying?

413
00:23:49.378 --> 00:23:51.840
No, I like studying,

414
00:23:51.847 --> 00:23:53.320
Then why are you acting like this?

415
00:23:53.415 --> 00:23:56.650
Han Gyul, is that friend who came to our house,,,

416
00:23:56.652 --> 00:23:58.920
bullying you?

417
00:23:58.921 --> 00:24:00.950
Or does your teacher bother you?

418
00:24:00.956 --> 00:24:05.130
No, I like my teacher and my friends too,

419
00:24:05.394 --> 00:24:06.820
So what's the matter then?

420
00:24:06.829 --> 00:24:09.330
You liked going to school at first,

421
00:24:09.331 --> 00:24:11.070
Why are you pretending to be sick now?

422
00:24:13.502 --> 00:24:16.940
It's okay, You can tell me, Why don't you want to go?

423
00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:22.310
Mom, don't go there,

424
00:24:22.811 --> 00:24:24.680
That place you drink coffee,,,

425
00:24:25.414 --> 00:24:27.020
You mean that kid's cafe?

426
00:24:27.549 --> 00:24:28.990
Don't you like it there?

427
00:24:32.254 --> 00:24:35.960
Okay, I won't go there if you don't like it,

428
00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:40.660
Okay, don't go there,

429
00:24:40.662 --> 00:24:44.560
Han Gyul, if you don't like your school,,,

430
00:24:44.566 --> 00:24:47.660
or the kid's cafe, I'll build a bigger school,,,

431
00:24:47.669 --> 00:24:49.670
and a bigger,,,

432
00:24:49.671 --> 00:24:54.140
kid's cafe for you,

433
00:24:54.142 --> 00:24:56.880
So don't worry about it, Go to school tomorrow, okay?

434
00:24:59.648 --> 00:25:01.050
Kid's cafe?

435
00:25:04.853 --> 00:25:06.560
(New store opening for SC Food and Beverage)

436
00:25:10.058 --> 00:25:11.420
Mr, Kim!

437
00:25:11.426 --> 00:25:14.530
Let me go, Please,

438
00:25:29.711 --> 00:25:31.950
Is this Sungyoga Hospital?

439
00:25:32.047 --> 00:25:35.050
I'm calling because of that patient who went through surgery yesterday,

440
00:25:35.851 --> 00:25:39.690
It's about Kim Dong Il, a patient who went in for head injuries,

441
00:25:40.422 --> 00:25:41.560
Yes,

442
00:25:43.859 --> 00:25:45.800
He's not awake yet?

443
00:25:46.395 --> 00:25:49.270
Could you give me a call when he wakes up?

444
00:25:49.364 --> 00:25:51.330
Yes, please, Thank you,

445
00:25:56.271 --> 00:25:57.770
Ru Ri,

446
00:25:58.140 --> 00:25:59.810
It's finally here,

447
00:25:59.908 --> 00:26:03.450
The poster for the new store, Ta-da,

448
00:26:04.913 --> 00:26:07.180
We have to make a poster for new menu too,

449
00:26:07.182 --> 00:26:08.850
You will give me the design layout, right?

450
00:26:09.918 --> 00:26:12.720
Manager Jung is so busy these days,

451
00:26:12.721 --> 00:26:14.860
I'll finish it up by this week,

452
00:26:16.091 --> 00:26:18.420
You're going through a tough time, aren't you?

453
00:26:18.427 --> 00:26:19.860
You don't look well,

454
00:26:19.861 --> 00:26:21.030
You're right,

455
00:26:22.164 --> 00:26:24.470
There's something really complicated these days,

456
00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:27.560
So could you and Sung Tan please work,,,

457
00:26:27.569 --> 00:26:29.310
on the internal work?

458
00:26:29.605 --> 00:26:31.780
- Please, - Okay,

459
00:26:31.907 --> 00:26:33.810
Don't worry,

460
00:26:33.875 --> 00:26:36.210
But don't lose your gratitude,

461
00:26:36.244 --> 00:26:38.480
If you get promoted,

462
00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.920
Sung Tan and I'll take care of here,

463
00:26:41.383 --> 00:26:43.050
Let's get this done!

464
00:26:43.852 --> 00:26:45.820
Sure, we're a team,

465
00:26:48.824 --> 00:26:50.090
Doesn't it look good?

466
00:26:50.092 --> 00:26:51.800
It's so pretty,

467
00:27:16.118 --> 00:27:18.150
I don't think he's dead because I haven't,,,

468
00:27:18.153 --> 00:27:19.720
heard about anything on the news,

469
00:27:20.322 --> 00:27:21.830
Where did he go to?

470
00:27:26.161 --> 00:27:27.300
(Inaugural Consent)

471
00:27:31.299 --> 00:27:33.140
This is the inaugural consent for you to be the next executive,

472
00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:37.340
I'll announce it to the board as soon as the paperwork is done,

473
00:27:40.242 --> 00:27:42.310
You can sign here,

474
00:27:46.915 --> 00:27:48.290
(Jung Tae Yang)

475
00:27:53.955 --> 00:27:58.060
Congratulations, You're now the next successor,

476
00:27:58.894 --> 00:28:00.100
Thank you,

477
00:28:01.196 --> 00:28:02.870
Get it done right now,

478
00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:14.080
I have a question,

479
00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:18.580
How is Director Park related to Joo Ae Ri?

480
00:28:18.847 --> 00:28:20.820
Why are you asking about it now?

481
00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:23.590
I have to know about them, We're a family now,

482
00:28:24.086 --> 00:28:26.220
How close are they?

483
00:28:26.354 --> 00:28:27.690
As you know,,,

484
00:28:28.657 --> 00:28:31.430
Director Park is a very lonely man,

485
00:28:31.827 --> 00:28:33.830
He barely talks about himself,

486
00:28:33.895 --> 00:28:36.230
He doesn't have family because he is not married,

487
00:28:36.431 --> 00:28:40.040
So that's why he thinks Ae Ri as his real daughter,

488
00:28:40.902 --> 00:28:43.740
If you felt bad about how he tried to set you guys up,

489
00:28:44.106 --> 00:28:45.780
forget about that now,

490
00:28:45.874 --> 00:28:48.550
He probably did that because he cares about you and her,

491
00:28:48.877 --> 00:28:51.980
Does Mr, Park also have some share in this company?

492
00:28:52.147 --> 00:28:54.080
Ae Ri is the only one that has shares,

493
00:28:54.082 --> 00:28:58.820
And that was only done after her mother died,

494
00:28:59.154 --> 00:29:03.030
So you and I are the biggest shareholders for now,

495
00:29:05.127 --> 00:29:07.930
This means Director Park won't have a chance to,,,

496
00:29:08.497 --> 00:29:11.390
be the president even if the position is missing?

497
00:29:11.399 --> 00:29:12.740
You're right,

498
00:29:12.901 --> 00:29:15.710
Why would you want to know about it all of sudden?

499
00:29:16.138 --> 00:29:19.780
Are you trying to take my place already?

500
00:29:20.942 --> 00:29:22.180
Come on,

501
00:29:22.744 --> 00:29:26.220
I now realize how lonely it must be to be a leader,

502
00:29:27.349 --> 00:29:28.580
Be careful at all times,

503
00:29:28.583 --> 00:29:31.110
I will, I feel better now since,,,

504
00:29:31.119 --> 00:29:33.220
you are here with me,

505
00:29:33.255 --> 00:29:34.720
Thank you, Tae Yang,

506
00:29:38.193 --> 00:29:39.800
- Just a second, - Yes,

507
00:29:41.997 --> 00:29:43.660
Mr, Kim is awake now,

508
00:29:43.665 --> 00:29:46.200
I think we should go to Sungyoga Hospital,

509
00:29:49.471 --> 00:29:50.940
How did it go?

510
00:29:51.206 --> 00:29:53.810
Did you find Mr, Kim?

511
00:29:53.975 --> 00:29:57.280
I looked everywhere and barely found him,

512
00:29:57.746 --> 00:30:00.820
I'm at Sungyoga Hospital, so hurry up and come here,

513
00:30:02.884 --> 00:30:04.090
Okay,

514
00:30:04.553 --> 00:30:05.820
I'll see you there,

515
00:30:42.691 --> 00:30:44.730
(Sungyoga Hospital)

516
00:30:49.197 --> 00:30:50.530
How did it go?

517
00:30:50.866 --> 00:30:52.600
Is he alive?

518
00:30:52.601 --> 00:30:55.640
I'm not sure if it's good or bad, but he woke up after the surgery,

519
00:30:57.405 --> 00:31:00.680
That means he could reveal the truth anytime,

520
00:31:01.376 --> 00:31:03.710
Did you do as I said and get rid of the cellphone?

521
00:31:04.145 --> 00:31:08.620
I got rid of anything that could be considered as evidence,

522
00:31:10.051 --> 00:31:12.860
All we have to do is keep Mr, Kim quiet,

523
00:31:13.388 --> 00:31:14.560
What will you do?

524
00:31:15.924 --> 00:31:17.330
Don't you know what I will do?

525
00:31:17.926 --> 00:31:20.760
I risked my entire life for this,

526
00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:24.530
I'm going to send him to a sanatorium,

527
00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:26.840
so he can't say a word until everything is settled,

528
00:31:47.856 --> 00:31:49.190
Don't worry,

529
00:31:49.591 --> 00:31:51.550
Since Mr, Kim woke up,

530
00:31:51.559 --> 00:31:54.000
we will find out who is behind Joo Ae Ri,

531
00:32:14.416 --> 00:32:15.990
What brings you here?

532
00:32:16.117 --> 00:32:17.910
We are Kim Dong Il's family,

533
00:32:17.919 --> 00:32:19.220
We got a call about him,

534
00:32:20.221 --> 00:32:21.960
He just woke up,

535
00:32:22.991 --> 00:32:24.330
That's good,

536
00:32:24.726 --> 00:32:27.930
We want to move him to a bigger hospital,

537
00:32:27.996 --> 00:32:29.330
Please proceed the procedure for us,

538
00:32:29.431 --> 00:32:31.730
He still needs rest,

539
00:32:31.733 --> 00:32:34.270
We have an ambulance waiting, Please do it for us,

540
00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:36.640
Yes, follow me,

541
00:32:56.658 --> 00:32:59.100
Hey, Kim Dong Il,

542
00:32:59.794 --> 00:33:01.330
Did you wake up?

543
00:33:08.970 --> 00:33:11.470
Can you understand me or not?

544
00:33:24.619 --> 00:33:27.290
That means he's regained his consciousness,

545
00:33:31.226 --> 00:33:32.630
Kim Dong Il,

546
00:33:33.628 --> 00:33:36.070
I think we have met before,

547
00:33:36.631 --> 00:33:37.930
Do you remember me?

548
00:33:49.744 --> 00:33:51.250
Room 602 is over there,

549
00:33:53.681 --> 00:33:57.620
(Ward 62, Room 6201-6212)

550
00:33:58.186 --> 00:33:59.460
Answer me,

551
00:34:00.655 --> 00:34:02.090
Do you remember me?

552
00:34:21.242 --> 00:34:23.680
Answer me, Do you remember me?

553
00:34:23.945 --> 00:34:25.520
Can you understand me or not?

554
00:34:32.921 --> 00:34:34.760
I think this is his room,

555
00:34:44.799 --> 00:34:46.640
Mr, Kim, did you wake up?

556
00:34:47.302 --> 00:34:48.640
Do you know where you are?

557
00:34:51.372 --> 00:34:54.870
That's right, You came here after you fell,

558
00:34:54.876 --> 00:34:56.080
You remember that, don't you?

559
00:35:00.715 --> 00:35:02.220
Answer my questions,

560
00:35:03.451 --> 00:35:05.720
Why did you remove the chairman's respirator?

561
00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:08.730
No, who pushed you last night?

562
00:35:09.924 --> 00:35:11.830
Who did this to you?

563
00:35:14.395 --> 00:35:16.600
We don't have time, Answer me,

564
00:35:17.398 --> 00:35:20.200
Tell me who ordered you to do all those things!

565
00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:23.510
Is it Director Park?

566
00:35:24.472 --> 00:35:25.810
Did he make you do it?

567
00:35:31.913 --> 00:35:33.180
Answer me,

568
00:35:33.982 --> 00:35:35.890
Tell me who is behind you?

569
00:35:43.091 --> 00:35:45.090
It's useless to do that right now,

570
00:35:45.293 --> 00:35:48.200
Let's meet the doctor first to ask about his current condition,

571
00:35:48.329 --> 00:35:50.770
If you don't tell the truth now,

572
00:35:52.233 --> 00:35:54.470
I'll hand you over to the police,

573
00:36:09.751 --> 00:36:12.660
We need to find out who is behind Joo Ae Ri and Mr, Kim,

574
00:36:17.592 --> 00:36:21.260
Honey, I just had a phone call with Choi Sun Young, who is in Japan,

575
00:36:21.563 --> 00:36:22.800
What did she say?

576
00:36:22.964 --> 00:36:24.970
Did she instigate Mr, Kim?

577
00:36:25.667 --> 00:36:26.970
I don't think so,

578
00:36:27.335 --> 00:36:30.740
She told me everything because she was upset with Mr, Kim,

579
00:36:31.072 --> 00:36:33.270
A few months ago,

580
00:36:33.274 --> 00:36:35.370
she asked him to work with her in Japan,

581
00:36:35.376 --> 00:36:36.610
He refused her on the spot,

582
00:36:36.611 --> 00:36:38.920
He was her right-hand man, Why did he do that?

583
00:36:39.047 --> 00:36:41.580
According to Choi Sun Young, he was very excited,

584
00:36:41.816 --> 00:36:45.490
She said that he boasted finding,,,

585
00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:47.260
someone who was powerful enough to ruin SC,

586
00:36:47.855 --> 00:36:49.530
What do you mean by,,,

587
00:36:50.124 --> 00:36:52.160
ruining SC?

588
00:36:53.161 --> 00:36:55.830
It probably means that Joo Ae Ri didn't do this,,,

589
00:36:56.231 --> 00:36:58.530
to marry Tae Yang,

590
00:36:58.967 --> 00:37:00.840
but she did this for a bigger goal,

591
00:37:01.236 --> 00:37:02.510
A bigger goal?

592
00:37:03.471 --> 00:37:04.710
What is that?

593
00:37:05.173 --> 00:37:10.080
Everything will become clear if Mr, Kim wakes up,

594
00:37:15.583 --> 00:37:17.190
The surgery went well,

595
00:37:17.318 --> 00:37:20.760
But he has defects in his memory due to that accident,

596
00:37:21.155 --> 00:37:22.430
Defects in his memory?

597
00:37:23.691 --> 00:37:27.400
Does that mean that he doesn't remember anything?

598
00:37:27.428 --> 00:37:30.830
Brain function defects are like a black box,

599
00:37:31.232 --> 00:37:33.100
His condition looks stable on his CT scan,

600
00:37:33.201 --> 00:37:35.470
but we can't guarantee when his memory will come back,

601
00:37:35.570 --> 00:37:38.310
He has to go through rehabilitation even if he moves hospitals,

602
00:37:41.776 --> 00:37:43.010
Here,

603
00:37:44.212 --> 00:37:45.450
Okay,

604
00:37:50.752 --> 00:37:52.990
I'm done with the procedure, I'll be there,

605
00:38:03.631 --> 00:38:04.830
Yes?

606
00:38:13.508 --> 00:38:16.780
Please hurry, Jung Tae Yang sensed something,

607
00:38:16.911 --> 00:38:18.150
I already know,

608
00:38:18.279 --> 00:38:20.280
The ambulance is here, Take him with you,

609
00:38:23.084 --> 00:38:24.550
What's the patient's name?

610
00:38:25.086 --> 00:38:26.290
Kim Dong Il,

611
00:38:26.521 --> 00:38:27.890
He was hospitalized last night,

612
00:38:27.989 --> 00:38:31.230
His family came and finished the procedure to move hospitals,

613
00:38:31.626 --> 00:38:33.900
What? That can't be,

614
00:38:34.262 --> 00:38:36.300
Are you sure that it was Kim Dong Il?

615
00:38:36.331 --> 00:38:39.540
I'm sure, He received urgent surgery for head damage,

616
00:38:39.901 --> 00:38:41.140
I can't believe this,

617
00:38:41.669 --> 00:38:42.870
What should we do?

618
00:38:43.338 --> 00:38:46.010
They must still be in the hospital,

619
00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:07.160
We don't have time, Hurry,

620
00:39:10.798 --> 00:39:12.640
Please be careful with him,

621
00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:14.870
Don't worry, Thank you,

622
00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:53.510
I'm sorry,

623
00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:08.120
Where did the patient go?

624
00:40:08.122 --> 00:40:09.150
Didn't you see him?

625
00:40:09.157 --> 00:40:12.430
His guardian just took him home,

626
00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:14.960
His guardian? What did they look like?

627
00:40:14.962 --> 00:40:17.790
She was a woman in her mid-40s,

628
00:40:17.799 --> 00:40:20.100
She had a burn scar on her face,

629
00:40:23.771 --> 00:40:25.170
I'm sorry,

630
00:40:28.042 --> 00:40:30.350
I saw her in the hallway just a few moments ago,

631
00:40:34.048 --> 00:40:37.050
I'm sorry, Please make a room, I'm sorry,

632
00:40:49.564 --> 00:40:51.830
There's no time, Let's take the stairs,

633
00:41:15.923 --> 00:41:17.160
Wait,

634
00:41:21.696 --> 00:41:22.970
What do we do now?

635
00:41:23.664 --> 00:41:26.140
We missed them right in front of us,

636
00:41:26.734 --> 00:41:28.470
You said you saw her face, right?

637
00:41:29.103 --> 00:41:30.240
Yes,

638
00:41:30.605 --> 00:41:33.680
But I've never seen her before,

639
00:41:34.041 --> 00:41:37.910
She has a vivid burn scar on her face,

640
00:41:38.312 --> 00:41:39.620
A burn scar?

641
00:41:51.692 --> 00:41:52.930
Ms, Choi,

642
00:41:54.462 --> 00:41:56.560
- Ms, Choi! - You scared me,

643
00:41:56.564 --> 00:41:58.100
Yes,

644
00:42:00.234 --> 00:42:04.170
You're always worried about getting fat,

645
00:42:04.171 --> 00:42:06.870
You're getting fat,,,

646
00:42:06.874 --> 00:42:09.640
because you're always sitting down,

647
00:42:09.644 --> 00:42:12.580
Be honest with me, What size do you wear?

648
00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:14.620
Is it 77? Or 88?

649
00:42:15.349 --> 00:42:18.350
Didn't you know?

650
00:42:18.352 --> 00:42:22.220
This is all muscles,

651
00:42:23.257 --> 00:42:25.620
This is a muscle?

652
00:42:25.626 --> 00:42:27.560
Flopping and squashy,

653
00:42:27.562 --> 00:42:30.230
It's all celluliter,

654
00:42:30.231 --> 00:42:33.960
Other people would think you smoke,

655
00:42:33.968 --> 00:42:37.730
It's not celluliter but cellulite,

656
00:42:37.738 --> 00:42:40.240
Gosh, You're driving me crazy,

657
00:42:40.241 --> 00:42:43.810
You must be always hungry because you know a lot,

658
00:42:43.811 --> 00:42:46.140
and you're always so curious,

659
00:42:46.147 --> 00:42:49.580
Hurry up and make a few snacks for soju,

660
00:42:49.584 --> 00:42:52.850
Goodness, Are you going to drink again?

661
00:42:52.853 --> 00:42:55.350
No, It's not me,

662
00:42:55.356 --> 00:42:59.020
There's a man who's going to drink soju today,

663
00:42:59.026 --> 00:43:00.800
Hurry up and do it,

664
00:43:00.895 --> 00:43:02.100
Yes, ma'am,

665
00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:09.510
How should I make Shin Mo mature?

666
00:43:10.671 --> 00:43:12.240
What's going to happen,,,

667
00:43:13.774 --> 00:43:15.410
tonight?

668
00:43:15.943 --> 00:43:18.310
Four people's meeting,

669
00:43:19.313 --> 00:43:23.120
I wonder how it will go,

670
00:43:23.484 --> 00:43:25.150
(Concert 7080)

671
00:43:25.152 --> 00:43:27.860
Don't hold back anymore

672
00:43:28.689 --> 00:43:31.660
Don't hide your heart

673
00:43:32.426 --> 00:43:35.660
Don't pretend you don't know

674
00:43:36.130 --> 00:43:38.800
It only burdens you

675
00:43:39.567 --> 00:43:42.400
You have to endure

676
00:43:43.170 --> 00:43:46.940
In life

677
00:43:46.941 --> 00:43:50.640
It's okay to be greedy

678
00:43:50.645 --> 00:43:54.220
Everyone does that

679
00:43:56.417 --> 00:43:57.990
This must be it,

680
00:43:59.153 --> 00:44:00.490
Yes,

681
00:44:00.588 --> 00:44:02.520
Let's go,

682
00:44:02.523 --> 00:44:06.330
You don't need to treat me like a princess,

683
00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:09.200
Really? If you don't want to be treated like a princess,

684
00:44:09.563 --> 00:44:12.100
I'll treat you like a queen, After you, Your Highness,

685
00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:15.340
Actually,,,

686
00:44:16.671 --> 00:44:20.000
I've got free tickets, Are you okay with that?

687
00:44:20.007 --> 00:44:23.650
Of course, You said it's the playground for middle-aged people,

688
00:44:24.812 --> 00:44:27.180
There may be someone who never visited here,

689
00:44:27.181 --> 00:44:30.250
but no one has visited here only once, I'm looking forward to it,

690
00:44:30.251 --> 00:44:32.350
Sing as much as you want today,

691
00:44:32.353 --> 00:44:34.150
I'll be your audience,

692
00:44:34.155 --> 00:44:36.760
Sure, But don't fall in love,

693
00:44:37.925 --> 00:44:39.330
- Let's go, - Yes,

694
00:44:41.462 --> 00:44:42.700
What's wrong?

695
00:44:43.464 --> 00:44:47.870
That voice sounds familiar,

696
00:44:48.969 --> 00:44:51.810
Many old singers come to places like this,

697
00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:54.980
That must be it,

698
00:44:55.676 --> 00:44:57.350
- Let's go, - Sure,

699
00:45:21.235 --> 00:45:23.270
You're still alive,

700
00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:24.970
Your voice still sounds like a boy,

701
00:45:24.972 --> 00:45:29.010
You've gone too far, Let's say a young man,

702
00:45:30.177 --> 00:45:31.310
Okay, Shin Mo,

703
00:45:31.312 --> 00:45:34.680
Then young Shin Mo is the best,

704
00:45:34.982 --> 00:45:38.050
I feel great today,

705
00:45:38.152 --> 00:45:39.720
You know there are people,,,

706
00:45:40.254 --> 00:45:43.750
who make you feel depressed,

707
00:45:43.758 --> 00:45:45.160
and people who cheer you up,

708
00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:49.560
I feel great when I meet you, Theresa,

709
00:45:49.563 --> 00:45:52.800
and I feel like I'm flying in the air,

710
00:45:53.801 --> 00:45:55.660
What was your wife like?

711
00:45:55.669 --> 00:45:57.270
Did she cheer you up or depress you?

712
00:45:57.271 --> 00:46:00.510
Don't even talk about her, She ruins my appetite,

713
00:46:01.275 --> 00:46:04.670
Goodness, You're known for having a good wife,

714
00:46:04.678 --> 00:46:06.950
Wasn't she a quiet good wife?

715
00:46:07.381 --> 00:46:11.290
A woman like her is scarier when she turns her back,

716
00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:15.790
I wasn't going to say this,

717
00:46:17.124 --> 00:46:20.660
but she's gotten into something that we recently graduated from marriage,

718
00:46:20.661 --> 00:46:22.030
Goodness, Shin Mo,

719
00:46:22.329 --> 00:46:25.390
Don't worry, It's good to be graduated from marriage,

720
00:46:25.399 --> 00:46:28.460
I'm free to meet you too,

721
00:46:28.469 --> 00:46:29.600
It's no problem,

722
00:46:29.603 --> 00:46:32.510
Really? Then,,,

723
00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:36.250
do you want to go to Jeju Island to see the ocean?

724
00:46:36.777 --> 00:46:38.680
Jeju Island?

725
00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:43.490
It's too far to go there for one day,

726
00:46:43.751 --> 00:46:45.620
Of course,

727
00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:49.120
We should go for at least three days,

728
00:46:49.123 --> 00:46:50.630
Book the flight for me,

729
00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:53.930
For three days?

730
00:46:56.330 --> 00:46:59.440
You want to sleep there for two nights?

731
00:47:08.175 --> 00:47:11.080
We can order food here,

732
00:47:11.378 --> 00:47:12.850
You can order something,

733
00:47:17.318 --> 00:47:19.560
I have a favor to ask you,

734
00:47:20.421 --> 00:47:21.560
What is it?

735
00:47:21.622 --> 00:47:23.790
I'm going on a business trip to Ulaanbaatar next month,

736
00:47:23.791 --> 00:47:25.160
I need company,

737
00:47:25.793 --> 00:47:28.530
I'm going to three days, Will you come with me?

738
00:47:28.696 --> 00:47:30.960
How could I go there?

739
00:47:30.965 --> 00:47:32.660
My local business partner,,,

740
00:47:32.666 --> 00:47:35.660
wants a party with spouses, That's why I'm asking,

741
00:47:35.669 --> 00:47:38.610
How can I go when it's for spouses?

742
00:47:38.873 --> 00:47:40.780
Actually that was an excuse,

743
00:47:40.875 --> 00:47:43.450
Did you know that Gobi Desert at night is beautiful?

744
00:47:44.678 --> 00:47:47.080
I don't want to see the Milky Way alone,

745
00:47:47.081 --> 00:47:48.350
Come with me,

746
00:48:02.329 --> 00:48:05.970
Mom, don't go there,

747
00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:08.230
That place you drink coffee,,,

748
00:48:08.235 --> 00:48:09.910
You mean that kid's cafe?

749
00:48:10.404 --> 00:48:11.810
Don't you like it there?

750
00:48:21.282 --> 00:48:23.580
What brings you all the way here?

751
00:48:23.584 --> 00:48:27.420
Se Ra's mother told me to give this to you,,,

752
00:48:27.421 --> 00:48:28.920
because Han Gyul missed kindergarten today,

753
00:48:31.191 --> 00:48:35.620
You know this cookie is handmade,,,

754
00:48:35.629 --> 00:48:38.200
with French organic flour,

755
00:48:38.899 --> 00:48:40.900
Hello,

756
00:48:40.901 --> 00:48:44.810
I'm here because I want to see Han Gyul,

757
00:48:45.773 --> 00:48:47.270
Sure, Welcome,

758
00:48:47.274 --> 00:48:49.810
She's in her room, You can go,

759
00:48:49.810 --> 00:48:52.920
What if I get sick too?

760
00:48:53.447 --> 00:48:54.780
Let's go,

761
00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:58.890
Hurry up, We have to go,

762
00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:02.930
Have some tea since you came all the way here,

763
00:49:04.391 --> 00:49:08.060
Is Han Gyul's dad coming home soon?

764
00:49:08.662 --> 00:49:09.930
No,

765
00:49:19.273 --> 00:49:20.640
Hello,

766
00:49:20.641 --> 00:49:22.310
I have a question,

767
00:49:22.543 --> 00:49:25.980
Is there someone named Jung Su Mi working here?

768
00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:29.050
Are you sure you didn't confuse the name?

769
00:49:29.083 --> 00:49:31.790
It's not Jung Su Mi, but Jung Su Ji,

770
00:49:33.153 --> 00:49:34.620
Jung Su Ji?

771
00:49:34.621 --> 00:49:36.930
Yes, She works here,

772
00:49:39.026 --> 00:49:40.420
Where is she now?

773
00:49:40.427 --> 00:49:42.320
The boss told her to,,,

774
00:49:42.329 --> 00:49:44.970
visit her daughter's friend from kindergarten,

775
00:49:45.966 --> 00:49:48.200
What's the matter?

776
00:49:52.673 --> 00:49:54.640
Are you okay?

777
00:49:55.175 --> 00:49:57.080
I feel better now,

778
00:49:57.277 --> 00:50:00.620
The school seems empty without you,

779
00:50:01.081 --> 00:50:02.280
Hold on,

780
00:50:02.983 --> 00:50:04.220
This is a gift for you,

781
00:50:04.918 --> 00:50:06.260
Can you open up for me?

782
00:50:10.524 --> 00:50:12.430
- Here, - Hey, Kim Do Yoon,

783
00:50:12.659 --> 00:50:14.690
She's suffering from sore throat,

784
00:50:14.695 --> 00:50:17.100
How can you give her this?

785
00:50:17.231 --> 00:50:18.470
Give me that,

786
00:50:22.770 --> 00:50:26.280
Kim Se Ra! I brought it for her,

787
00:50:29.943 --> 00:50:31.680
Drink up some milk,

788
00:50:32.146 --> 00:50:33.140
What?

789
00:50:33.147 --> 00:50:35.720
Your stomach will get upset if you eat it too fast,

790
00:50:36.050 --> 00:50:37.390
Drink it,

791
00:50:37.985 --> 00:50:40.990
I have more than 100 sausages at home,

792
00:50:41.255 --> 00:50:43.830
If you want more of it, you can tell me,

793
00:50:45.259 --> 00:50:46.530
100?

794
00:50:50.798 --> 00:50:52.200
They're cute,

795
00:50:56.837 --> 00:50:59.410
Your name is Su Ji, right?

796
00:51:00.441 --> 00:51:04.050
Do you always bring Se Ra around, Su Ji?

797
00:51:04.144 --> 00:51:05.670
Because her mother is busy,

798
00:51:05.679 --> 00:51:08.220
I bring her to school, and I play with her sometimes,

799
00:51:09.083 --> 00:51:10.550
Is that so?

800
00:51:10.818 --> 00:51:14.390
I have to ask you to look after Han Gyul, when I'm busy,

801
00:51:15.255 --> 00:51:17.930
Sure, I'm good with kids,

802
00:51:21.628 --> 00:51:22.830
Excuse me,

803
00:51:22.830 --> 00:51:27.660
Han Gyul is generous just like me,

804
00:51:27.668 --> 00:51:29.640
She's not stingy at all,

805
00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:32.070
I'll teach her about real estate business,,,

806
00:51:32.072 --> 00:51:35.480
once she's done with school,

807
00:51:35.542 --> 00:51:38.810
She's just like me,

808
00:51:38.812 --> 00:51:40.220
including her generosity,

809
00:51:40.681 --> 00:51:42.780
Mom, stop it,

810
00:51:44.451 --> 00:51:47.360
She's your granddaughter, It's natural she's like you,

811
00:51:51.024 --> 00:51:52.590
Have fun here,

812
00:51:57.397 --> 00:51:58.670
Honey,

813
00:52:00.834 --> 00:52:02.200
I have a question,

814
00:52:02.402 --> 00:52:04.110
What's Han Gyul doing now?

815
00:52:05.105 --> 00:52:08.780
She's playing with her friends at home,

816
00:52:09.042 --> 00:52:10.710
Are just the kids there?

817
00:52:10.711 --> 00:52:14.120
The part-timer from the kid's cafe brought them here,

818
00:52:15.182 --> 00:52:16.390
Really?

819
00:52:17.351 --> 00:52:18.550
Okay,

820
00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:21.860
She's insane,

821
00:52:27.694 --> 00:52:29.730
I am a sinner,

822
00:52:29.730 --> 00:52:32.730
(Speaking Chinese: Advanced Business Level)

823
00:52:32.733 --> 00:52:34.970
I have to find my son,

824
00:52:39.239 --> 00:52:42.910
His name is Ha Eun Jo,

825
00:52:46.947 --> 00:52:51.390
I thought Dr, Lee is looking for Eun Jo,

826
00:52:55.756 --> 00:53:00.160
Goodness, Well I'll be,

827
00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:02.930
I was just talking about you,

828
00:53:02.930 --> 00:53:05.430
You're home early,

829
00:53:05.432 --> 00:53:07.040
How was work?

830
00:53:07.668 --> 00:53:09.300
Yes, How was your day?

831
00:53:09.603 --> 00:53:11.640
Where is Yeon Ju?

832
00:53:12.439 --> 00:53:15.580
She's having a tea with a guest in the kitchen,

833
00:53:23.250 --> 00:53:24.480
You're home early,

834
00:53:24.484 --> 00:53:26.360
Yes, I heard there's a guest?

835
00:53:26.853 --> 00:53:28.060
A guest?

836
00:53:28.121 --> 00:53:30.430
You mean the part-timer?

837
00:53:31.358 --> 00:53:33.060
She's in Han Gyul's room,

838
00:53:37.564 --> 00:53:38.800
Honey,

839
00:53:42.169 --> 00:53:43.410
What's wrong with him?

840
00:53:45.872 --> 00:53:49.580
Honey, what did you do at home the whole day?

841
00:53:49.610 --> 00:53:51.280
You let the baby catch cold!

842
00:53:51.311 --> 00:53:54.820
Why don't you stay at home looking after the baby?

843
00:53:55.549 --> 00:53:58.290
You think it's easy to raise two kids?

844
00:53:59.753 --> 00:54:02.350
Guys, stop fighting,

845
00:54:02.356 --> 00:54:05.350
Why can't you live like my mom and dad?

846
00:54:05.359 --> 00:54:07.700
How do your mom and dad live?

847
00:54:09.730 --> 00:54:12.330
They love each other like this,

848
00:54:16.103 --> 00:54:18.410
Se Ra, let's go home now,

849
00:54:24.311 --> 00:54:28.320
You remember what I told you, right?

850
00:54:31.318 --> 00:54:32.720
Stop acting so arrogant,

851
00:54:34.855 --> 00:54:36.830
- Let's go now, - Okay,

852
00:54:41.561 --> 00:54:42.860
Dad,

853
00:54:44.164 --> 00:54:45.370
It's okay,

854
00:54:46.733 --> 00:54:49.140
- Can I speak to you? - I'm busy,

855
00:54:51.772 --> 00:54:53.010
Follow me,

856
00:54:59.579 --> 00:55:01.080
What's wrong with you?

857
00:55:01.181 --> 00:55:02.980
I warned you,

858
00:55:03.450 --> 00:55:05.790
I told you I won't leave you be if you continue to show up around here,

859
00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:08.120
Didn't you see Han Gyul's face?

860
00:55:08.355 --> 00:55:10.930
- She was scared, - Lower your voice,

861
00:55:11.191 --> 00:55:13.500
What if your wife hears you?

862
00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:15.100
You're out of control,

863
00:55:16.830 --> 00:55:18.470
Why are you doing this?

864
00:55:19.032 --> 00:55:20.800
How dare you come here!

865
00:55:20.801 --> 00:55:22.800
I need 69,000 dollars,

866
00:55:23.170 --> 00:55:26.580
Give me the money, and I will never come again,

867
00:55:28.542 --> 00:55:30.180
You're out of your mind,

868
00:55:36.049 --> 00:55:39.350
Please give me the marinated crabs for So Won,

869
00:55:39.353 --> 00:55:40.620
Yes,

870
00:55:43.423 --> 00:55:44.660
Ma'am,

871
00:55:45.092 --> 00:55:48.430
We have to go home, Where is Su Ji?

872
00:55:48.628 --> 00:55:50.170
Isn't she in Han Gyul's room?

873
00:55:50.197 --> 00:55:53.600
No, she and Han Gyul's dad went out together,

874
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.240
What did you say?

875
00:55:57.904 --> 00:56:00.310
I knew you were shameless,

876
00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:02.480
But why should I give you the money?

877
00:56:03.043 --> 00:56:04.580
Do you think that makes sense?

878
00:56:04.678 --> 00:56:06.110
I need the money,

879
00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:09.080
I'll swear, If you give me the money,,,

880
00:56:09.349 --> 00:56:10.990
I'll disappear from your life,

881
00:56:11.151 --> 00:56:12.620
This conversation is over,

882
00:56:13.420 --> 00:56:16.020
I'll call the police right now, so that's that,

883
00:56:16.022 --> 00:56:17.390
Your wife,,,

884
00:56:18.125 --> 00:56:21.200
will be okay if she finds out whose daughter Han Gyul is?

885
00:56:21.661 --> 00:56:23.060
I think she'll suffer,

886
00:56:23.663 --> 00:56:25.100
Is that okay with you?

887
00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:27.800
Gosh,

888
00:56:27.801 --> 00:56:29.800
So give me the money,

889
00:56:31.772 --> 00:56:32.970
Honey,

890
00:56:34.441 --> 00:56:35.810
What are you doing here?

891
00:56:36.810 --> 00:56:39.010
Well,,,

892
00:56:39.946 --> 00:56:42.550
Ma'am, I'm sorry,

893
00:56:42.582 --> 00:56:45.050
He was scolding me because I made some mistakes,

894
00:56:45.952 --> 00:56:47.560
I'll be careful next time,

895
00:56:52.359 --> 00:56:55.700
What did she do?

896
00:56:57.030 --> 00:56:58.570
I don't think she's nice,

897
00:56:59.032 --> 00:57:00.440
Don't let her in ever again,

898
00:57:01.201 --> 00:57:04.910
Hold on, You have to tell me what she did,

899
00:57:05.372 --> 00:57:06.870
She looked nice,

900
00:57:06.873 --> 00:57:10.010
I was just getting close to her to hear about school too,

901
00:57:10.143 --> 00:57:12.010
Don't get close to her!

902
00:57:12.212 --> 00:57:13.450
That girl!

903
00:57:18.351 --> 00:57:22.390
Yeon Ju, just listen to me, and do as I say,

904
00:57:23.857 --> 00:57:25.930
Don't let her in, I mean,,,

905
00:57:26.193 --> 00:57:28.030
Don't let her get near Han Gyul,

906
00:57:29.729 --> 00:57:31.700
Honey,

907
00:57:34.301 --> 00:57:35.600
I'm doing this for you,

908
00:57:36.336 --> 00:57:39.410
So please do as I said,

909
00:57:59.693 --> 00:58:02.830
What's taking so long?

910
00:58:07.167 --> 00:58:10.510
Let's go on a three-day trip to Jeju Island,

911
00:58:14.875 --> 00:58:18.780
Is she saying,,,

912
00:58:19.880 --> 00:58:21.450
that she wants,,,

913
00:58:22.282 --> 00:58:25.220
go to that island and spend two days,,,

914
00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:30.760
walking the beach, just the two of us?

915
00:58:33.126 --> 00:58:36.600
Hold on, Which hotel should I book?

916
00:58:37.564 --> 00:58:39.430
An inn? No,

917
00:58:39.599 --> 00:58:43.810
I have to book a five-star hotel for her,

918
00:58:44.104 --> 00:58:45.310
That's right,

919
00:58:46.673 --> 00:58:50.310
So that watch is,,,

920
00:58:51.444 --> 00:58:54.550
2,480 dollars,

921
00:58:55.382 --> 00:58:57.890
I'll put it on installment for 12 months,

922
00:58:59.619 --> 00:59:02.360
So,,, that is,,,

923
00:59:05.525 --> 00:59:06.800
A month,,,

924
00:59:17.904 --> 00:59:21.580
I don't want to see the beautiful Gobi Desert alone,

925
00:59:25.545 --> 00:59:27.950
It's really pretty, though,

926
00:59:29.182 --> 00:59:30.720
How can I go there with him,,,

927
00:59:31.151 --> 00:59:32.790
even if it's a business trip?

928
00:59:38.425 --> 00:59:42.460
You've stolen my heart

929
00:59:42.462 --> 00:59:44.970
When we just came across

930
00:59:45.532 --> 00:59:47.640
Why is he singing that song?

931
00:59:47.801 --> 00:59:49.140
It reminds me of someone,

932
00:59:49.836 --> 00:59:52.740
You've stolen my heart

933
00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:58.940
I'm your light

934
00:59:58.945 --> 01:00:05.690
Why am I so shy

935
01:00:08.021 --> 01:00:11.890
I want to date her, but I don't feel confident

936
01:00:11.891 --> 01:00:15.100
My heart only pounds

937
01:00:15.762 --> 01:00:19.560
My oppressed heart

938
01:00:19.566 --> 01:00:24.400
I'll have it blown off in the wind

939
01:00:24.404 --> 01:00:27.140
Isn't he hot? He's my brother's friend,

940
01:00:27.674 --> 01:00:29.870
Shin Mo, It's me,

941
01:00:29.876 --> 01:00:32.080
Yes, Hi,

942
01:00:36.983 --> 01:00:39.150
This is my friend, Hong Young Hye,

943
01:00:39.152 --> 01:00:41.960
She's the beauty of education major, Isn't she beautiful?

944
01:00:45.925 --> 01:00:48.660
Let's have bread together,

945
01:00:53.833 --> 01:00:55.300
Gosh,

946
01:00:56.102 --> 01:00:59.310
That song's ruining my appetite,

947
01:01:02.042 --> 01:01:03.810
Accidentally met

948
01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:22.260
That woman,

949
01:01:23.196 --> 01:01:24.830
This is absurd,

950
01:01:32.672 --> 01:01:33.910
Theresa?

951
01:01:34.874 --> 01:01:37.450
What are you doing here?

952
01:01:37.811 --> 01:01:39.410
You must've changed your stage,

953
01:01:39.412 --> 01:01:42.080
You used to play in Suji, Is it Hongdae now?

954
01:01:43.650 --> 01:01:45.790
I can't stand anything boring,

955
01:01:46.019 --> 01:01:48.390
I need to change my playground from time to time,

956
01:01:49.589 --> 01:01:51.560
Is it a playground or a hunting ground?

957
01:01:54.194 --> 01:01:56.460
You must've found a new sugar daddy,

958
01:01:56.896 --> 01:01:59.430
The model for the watch is always the same,

959
01:02:02.302 --> 01:02:04.740
You aren't probably here alone,

960
01:02:05.271 --> 01:02:08.410
Let's be polite and ignore one another,

961
01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:22.360
Are you out of your mind?

962
01:02:22.522 --> 01:02:26.560
How dare you come to here at this hour?

963
01:02:26.793 --> 01:02:31.270
You're not here with your boss, are you?

964
01:02:31.965 --> 01:02:33.730
Look who's talking,

965
01:02:33.733 --> 01:02:35.600
What are you doing here?

966
01:02:35.602 --> 01:02:37.100
You aren't probably here alone,

967
01:02:37.103 --> 01:02:38.910
It's different for men and women,

968
01:02:39.472 --> 01:02:42.510
What? Gosh,

969
01:02:43.209 --> 01:02:44.550
Look at this,

970
01:02:44.811 --> 01:02:47.420
You even drink with him now?

971
01:02:48.214 --> 01:02:51.190
How dare you?

972
01:02:51.985 --> 01:02:53.660
Get up now,

973
01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:56.260
Go home before you get drunk,

974
01:02:57.023 --> 01:02:58.490
Ridiculous,

975
01:02:59.392 --> 01:03:01.760
Your words don't match your action,

976
01:03:01.861 --> 01:03:04.530
You said you won't care,,,

977
01:03:04.531 --> 01:03:08.160
whether I have some tea with him or get a ride from him,

978
01:03:08.168 --> 01:03:11.140
Are you saying you can't leave?

979
01:03:11.504 --> 01:03:14.480
Are you saying you're going to drink until you pass out?

980
01:03:14.941 --> 01:03:16.440
Keep your voice down,

981
01:03:16.442 --> 01:03:19.910
The woman I saw you with last time in the parking lot is back,

982
01:03:23.650 --> 01:03:25.550
Fine,

983
01:03:25.552 --> 01:03:28.890
Hong Young Hye, If you're going to do this,

984
01:03:29.255 --> 01:03:31.630
I'm going to film a romance comedy movie,,,

985
01:03:31.925 --> 01:03:34.100
for the last time in my life,

986
01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:38.830
It's going to be with a romantic girl,,,

987
01:03:38.832 --> 01:03:42.040
who's been waiting for me for 25 years,

988
01:03:52.979 --> 01:03:54.450
What are you looking at?

989
01:03:55.215 --> 01:03:58.720
Your voice is hot, so I'm going to request a song,

990
01:03:59.352 --> 01:04:00.990
Not at all,

991
01:04:01.754 --> 01:04:04.120
I often hear that I have,,,

992
01:04:04.123 --> 01:04:07.060
a low sweet tone,

993
01:04:08.561 --> 01:04:11.170
Give it to me, I'll take a look,

994
01:04:11.698 --> 01:04:13.740
- Here, - Okay,

995
01:04:28.882 --> 01:04:30.950
Is something wrong?

996
01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:32.620
You don't look good,

997
01:04:32.819 --> 01:04:34.720
Let's leave,

998
01:04:35.655 --> 01:04:36.920
Why?

999
01:04:37.023 --> 01:04:39.830
I met the swindler woman I told you about here,

1000
01:04:40.927 --> 01:04:42.930
She must've met another sugar daddy,

1001
01:04:43.229 --> 01:04:45.200
She's already wearing a new watch,

1002
01:04:45.298 --> 01:04:46.630
Where,,,

1003
01:04:46.966 --> 01:04:48.740
Where is she?

1004
01:04:49.102 --> 01:04:52.510
You don't need to feel uncomfortable,

1005
01:04:52.972 --> 01:04:55.480
- Let's go, - Sure,

1006
01:04:56.276 --> 01:04:59.510
I was actually feeling uncomfortable,

1007
01:05:13.459 --> 01:05:15.460
- I'm sorry, - Why?

1008
01:05:15.461 --> 01:05:19.300
I told you that swindler's met a new sugar daddy,

1009
01:05:21.334 --> 01:05:22.540
That is,,,

1010
01:05:23.102 --> 01:05:24.410
Well,,,

1011
01:05:24.771 --> 01:05:26.470
I think it's Lee Shin Mo,

1012
01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:28.180
Pardon?

1013
01:05:55.802 --> 01:05:58.040
(Man Who Sets the Table)

1014
01:05:58.104 --> 01:05:59.730
I got a call from the detective agency,

1015
01:05:59.739 --> 01:06:01.600
They've found a possible guy,

1016
01:06:01.607 --> 01:06:03.540
I don't know if she is my sister or mother,

1017
01:06:03.543 --> 01:06:05.940
I remember a young woman,

1018
01:06:05.945 --> 01:06:07.280
We'll look for her,

1019
01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:08.540
69,000 dollars?

1020
01:06:08.548 --> 01:06:11.080
I need that money, Hurry up,

1021
01:06:11.084 --> 01:06:12.480
What is it for?

1022
01:06:12.485 --> 01:06:13.510
Say it,

1023
01:06:13.519 --> 01:06:14.920
Let them enjoy it,

1024
01:06:14.921 --> 01:06:17.920
The father and son will collapse like a tsunami,

1025
01:06:17.924 --> 01:06:19.790
You sold your child for parole,

1026
01:06:19.792 --> 01:06:21.390
How dare you blackmail us for money?

1027
01:06:21.394 --> 01:06:22.860
Are you even a human?

1028
01:06:22.862 --> 01:06:25.530
If she's playing with someone's life, it's probably very serious,

1029
01:06:25.531 --> 01:06:27.540
I have to find out what it is,
