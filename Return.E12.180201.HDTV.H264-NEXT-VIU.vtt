(Episode 12)

2
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:17.839
Why did Ms. Choi send me a text?

3
00:00:19.879 --> 00:00:24.109
"You must have come there because you somewhat knew what is going on."

4
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.480
What is this?

5
00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:35.090
(Gangdong Precinct)

6
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.329
Dong Bae. Shoot.

7
00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.369
So that's why she gave me the cold shoulder.

8
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.930
(Robbery and Injury, Kim Joon Woo)

9
00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:18.569
What are you doing over there?

10
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.909
Were you talking to me just now?

11
00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:28.609
Why did you put gum on the face of the wanted criminal?

12
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.549
Do you not know that's a violation of the law too?

13
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.480
What's going on with the training of officers at this precinct?

14
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.090
They seem inadequate in respecting their seniors.

15
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.959
You're all working hard.

16
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.859
I can't remember the last time I smelled sweat.

17
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.030
For decades, I only smelled perfume, but smelling sweat...

18
00:01:48.129 --> 00:01:49.659
energizes me. Don't you agree?

19
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.200
What brings you here?

20
00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:56.969
My car brought me here.

21
00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:05.010
Who's in charge of the murder case from Paju?

22
00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:08.580
He's not here at the moment.

23
00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:16.389
It's all right.

24
00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:18.759
My gosh. Seriously.

25
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.229
Mister. You cannot read the case file.

26
00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:23.370
"Mister"?

27
00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:25.129
My gosh.

28
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.400
It's all right. You can consider me as one of you.

29
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.439
Go back to work.

30
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.180
(DNA Test Result)

31
00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.449
What are you doing?

32
00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:45.719
Have all of you gone blind?

33
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.120
How can you just sit there and watch? How can you?

34
00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:58.300
Why is an outsider reading a police report without permission?

35
00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:02.500
Your eyes are gleaming.

36
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.509
You used to whine and cry when you were working for me.

37
00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:10.310
You grew up all right.

38
00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:15.020
This isn't even your district. Why are you here?

39
00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.689
You should stick to your turf.

40
00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:18.590
Mr. Ahn?

41
00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:21.419
Long time no see.

42
00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:24.830
My gosh, how long has it been?

43
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:26.360
Look at you.

44
00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:29.800
I heard that you were promoted. You look quite dashing now.

45
00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.330
What brings you here?

46
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:32.900
I came here for a visit.

47
00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:37.840
I can't show you my gratitude due to the anti-bribery and graft act.

48
00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.340
My officers aren't comfortable with you around.

49
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.039
Let's go to the lounge.

50
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.310
Sure.

51
00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:48.979
Hey, Rookie.

52
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:51.750
See you around.

53
00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:55.860
Let's get going.

54
00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.729
If you don't want to live like him,

55
00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:00.930
let's stay focused.

56
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.129
Get back to work.

57
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.169
(Detective Notebook)

58
00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.860
Where can I find that jerk, Dong Bae?

59
00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:31.730
- My gosh, be careful. - Okay.

60
00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.100
This way.

61
00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.300
All right. Please get in.

62
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.069
Thank you.

63
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.540
This is a small gift.

64
00:04:42.399 --> 00:04:43.769
You're very beautiful.

65
00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:47.240
Please be careful. Let me get the door for you.

66
00:04:51.709 --> 00:04:52.750
Please come back.

67
00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.819
That mutt.

68
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:01.990
Did you see him wagging his tail?

69
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.689
I really talked a lot to flatter that customer.

70
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.569
He used to flatter me just like that.

71
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.100
So...

72
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.800
what do you want to do?

73
00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.110
Isn't it obvious?

74
00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:20.279
I want to run him over with a car.

75
00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:24.579
Hak Bum, when you talk,

76
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.379
you should use your brain to filter what you say. Got that?

77
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:29.680
What?

78
00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:31.389
He's blackmailing us.

79
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.220
Should I leave him alone then?

80
00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:34.459
Say that you do run him over,

81
00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:37.829
what about the dash cam video that shows that we moved the body?

82
00:05:37.829 --> 00:05:38.990
You think he just left it alone?

83
00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:40.660
So what then?

84
00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:43.430
Should we pay him off?

85
00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:44.629
We can't do that either.

86
00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:48.639
How should I know if he made extra copies?

87
00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.240
Are you serious?

88
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.279
Then what do you want to do?

89
00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:55.810
First off,

90
00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:58.350
check on Joon Hee.

91
00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.019
(Daemyung Hospital)

92
00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:17.529
Hey.

93
00:06:18.829 --> 00:06:20.139
Don't you know who I am?

94
00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:23.610
The director ordered to stop anyone from visiting except his doctors.

95
00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:24.610
What?

96
00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:27.639
How dare you shoot your mouth off?

97
00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:30.550
What? Have you gone mad?

98
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:31.550
Hey.

99
00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.480
What did you say? Who ordered what?

100
00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.819
Say that again. Who did you say?

101
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:41.089
You just ran your mouth. Why are you keeping quiet now?

102
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.360
Have you lost your marbles?

103
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:44.790
You're not going to move?

104
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:48.360
Hey!

105
00:06:50.899 --> 00:06:53.699
I just memorized...

106
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.699
your faces.

107
00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.410
Lead the life...

108
00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.509
of the lowlife, jerks.

109
00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:05.910
Darn you.

110
00:07:06.949 --> 00:07:09.449
You good-for-nothing morons. Seriously.

111
00:07:20.259 --> 00:07:22.300
I couldn't meet Joon Hee.

112
00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:26.329
Nobody is allowed to meet him except his assigned doctor.

113
00:07:26.899 --> 00:07:28.399
How is Mr. Seo Joon Hee?

114
00:07:28.439 --> 00:07:29.740
They didn't tell me about that either.

115
00:07:30.339 --> 00:07:32.910
The date for our first trial has been set. We're in trouble then.

116
00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:36.649
The only card we can play to overturn the trial is Seo Joon Hee.

117
00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:38.550
Yes, I know.

118
00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:42.019
Okay. First off, try to persuade Mr. Seo Chan Jong, the director.

119
00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:44.790
We must win him over to our side by any means necessary.

120
00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:46.250
Okay. I will try.

121
00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.959
- Okay. - Are you ready to order?

122
00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:50.290
A cup of mocha coffee, please.

123
00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:51.959
That will be four dollars.

124

(Kim Jung Soo, Daemyung Hospital)

127
00:08:59.389 --> 00:09:00.529
Is Mr. Oh in his office?

128
00:09:00.899 --> 00:09:01.960
Who are you?

129
00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.000
You don't need to know how I am.

130
00:09:05.799 --> 00:09:06.799
If he's in,

131
00:09:07.799 --> 00:09:09.269
tell him that Kim Byung Gi...

132
00:09:10.809 --> 00:09:12.210
is waiting for him downstairs.

133
00:09:13.279 --> 00:09:15.639
You should give him a call.

134
00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:18.809
I'm cold. Come on, hurry up.

135
00:09:22.879 --> 00:09:23.889
Shot.

136
00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:27.519
You never miss your target.

137
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:30.129
Shouldn't you be a professional if you're this good?

138
00:09:30.129 --> 00:09:33.559
I couldn't do that because I found out I'm needed in many areas.

139
00:09:34.529 --> 00:09:37.070
Of course. I can't imagine how busy you must be.

140
00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:40.269
Well, as you have requested,

141
00:09:40.269 --> 00:09:42.570
I didn't accept other customers.

142
00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:44.440
But one customer...

143
00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.539
will be coming soon.

144
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:47.740
That's all right.

145
00:09:48.509 --> 00:09:50.549
Why don't you go boar hunting some other time?

146
00:09:50.549 --> 00:09:51.809
Isn't that illegal?

147
00:09:51.809 --> 00:09:53.580
No, the parameter of the hunting area is set.

148
00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:54.980
Hunting within the area is legal.

149
00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.889
- Really? - I heard that...

150
00:09:56.889 --> 00:09:59.690
wild boars cause farms a lot of harm too.

151
00:09:59.919 --> 00:10:01.590
Why don't you join me when you're free?

152
00:10:01.789 --> 00:10:04.059
Shooting an animal is different from shooting clay targets.

153
00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.629
I'm not sure if that's a good reason to hunt the wild boars.

154
00:10:07.929 --> 00:10:09.529
All life is equally valuable.

155
00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:10.830
I'll pass.

156
00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:14.600
You're a much greater person than we are.

157
00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:17.039
- Let me take this. - I'll let you go then.

158
00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:21.009
Hey.

159
00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:24.080
Who?

160
00:10:26.279 --> 00:10:29.450
Tell him to wait. Why are you calling?

161
00:10:42.259 --> 00:10:43.929
I didn't know we had common interests.

162
00:10:45.169 --> 00:10:46.269
Mr. Oh?

163
00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.600
You're pretty good.

164
00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.740
My skills improved once I had a goal.

165
00:10:53.639 --> 00:10:56.779
I wanted to take some time.

166
00:10:58.750 --> 00:10:59.750
Go ahead.

167
00:11:24.269 --> 00:11:25.269
Come in.

168
00:11:28.039 --> 00:11:29.909
Hey. Mr. Oh!

169
00:11:31.909 --> 00:11:33.519
This is awesome.

170
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:38.220
My gosh.

171
00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.159
Do you want this?

172
00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.730
It's okay. You may go.

173
00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.500
You punk.

174
00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.740
I waited a long time.

175
00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:01.809
My blood sugar level dropped, so I grabbed a lollipop.

176
00:12:01.809 --> 00:12:03.039
What is it?

177
00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:07.049
You heard. Don't act dumb.

178
00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:10.690
You aren't acting like you want money, so I was confused.

179
00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:19.559
Will you give me the money?

180
00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:24.070
If you want that money, you shouldn't be rude like today.

181
00:12:28.169 --> 00:12:31.039
Then... I'll wait.

182
00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:41.820
I'll wait, Mr. Oh Tae Suk.

183
00:12:49.559 --> 00:12:51.490
Go right ahead,

184
00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:56.330
you useless punk.

185
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:18.120
Ma'am! Are you home?

186
00:13:22.789 --> 00:13:24.289
Who is it?

187
00:13:24.289 --> 00:13:27.960
Hi! It's me again. Dong Bae's friend from work!

188
00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:32.669
I was in the area and wanted to see you!

189
00:13:32.669 --> 00:13:34.039
Would you let me in?

190
00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:43.110
What?

191
00:13:45.149 --> 00:13:47.379
Let's talk somewhere away from my mom.

192
00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:53.659
Are you even worried about her?

193
00:13:58.559 --> 00:14:00.330
- Give me your hand. - Why?

194
00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:01.830
How can I trust you?

195
00:14:03.299 --> 00:14:04.929
Must we do this?

196
00:14:04.929 --> 00:14:07.669
Don't be upset. You brought this upon yourself.

197
00:14:08.139 --> 00:14:10.009
You know,

198
00:14:10.009 --> 00:14:12.970
I had no idea you could fly those past years we were together.

199
00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:15.809
You jumped over the wall like that.

200
00:14:15.809 --> 00:14:17.809
And you jumped down from the third floor.

201
00:14:17.809 --> 00:14:20.850
If I've known about that, I would've made you more helpful.

202
00:14:21.649 --> 00:14:23.120
What will you do with me now?

203
00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:27.659
Let's go somewhere and have a nice talk, okay?

204
00:14:28.519 --> 00:14:29.519
Seriously.

205
00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:34.860
See? People are staring.

206
00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.700
Who cares if they stare?

207
00:14:41.769 --> 00:14:43.139
Talk. If you don't,

208
00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:46.370
I'll shoot a porn video right here like this, okay?

209
00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:48.710
I'll talk. I was going to tell you anyway.

210
00:14:48.909 --> 00:14:50.909
But please uncuff me first.

211
00:14:57.933 --> 00:15:02.933
<font color="#fcc89b">[VIU Ver] E12 Return "We'll Pay Him"</font>
<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

212
00:15:09.659 --> 00:15:10.669
Tell me.

213
00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.039
I received some money.

214
00:15:15.039 --> 00:15:16.909
- I know. - You do?

215
00:15:16.909 --> 00:15:19.139
Who in this field is loyal?

216
00:15:19.139 --> 00:15:21.379
Did you think you could keep that secret forever?

217
00:15:22.679 --> 00:15:25.350
So? Is that how you bought that car you gave me?

218
00:15:25.409 --> 00:15:28.279
- I'm not that big a scuzzball. - You brat.

219
00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:32.750
Fine. Leave out what I already know.

220
00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:35.019
What else is there?

221
00:15:38.659 --> 00:15:39.960
I was threatened.

222
00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:42.330
About what?

223
00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:44.700
He said I'd lose my badge.

224
00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:49.909
My badge is my mom's only hope.

225
00:15:49.909 --> 00:15:51.070
You saw her.

226
00:15:51.269 --> 00:15:53.539
She can't see or walk well.

227
00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:58.779
If I say I'll buy her a wheelchair so that she can get out a little,

228
00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:04.590
she says she'll disgrace her cop son, and refuses.

229
00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:05.649
That's how she is.

230
00:16:08.059 --> 00:16:11.259
She lives in that tiny room like it's her prison cell...

231
00:16:11.259 --> 00:16:12.259
because of me.

232
00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:16.059
How could I tell her that I'm a dirty cop...

233
00:16:16.059 --> 00:16:17.970
that takes bribes from bad people?

234
00:16:19.899 --> 00:16:22.070
So why did you do it?

235
00:16:22.399 --> 00:16:25.269
You're your mom's only hope. Why?

236
00:16:26.169 --> 00:16:28.009
I don't know. I must've lost my mind.

237
00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:31.710
So who threatened you?

238
00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:34.720
I don't know.

239
00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:39.120
I received a photo of me taking money from them.

240
00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:50.470
I tried to ignore it at first.

241
00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:53.769
I wasn't the only one taking bribes.

242
00:16:54.299 --> 00:16:56.299
Who would dare judge me?

243
00:16:59.909 --> 00:17:01.240
What's this?

244
00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:06.750
This was delivered by a messenger. But I have no idea what this is.

245
00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:08.150
However,

246
00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:13.220
they sent my mom the same video.

247
00:17:14.859 --> 00:17:16.220
I was terrified.

248
00:17:16.789 --> 00:17:19.359
Is that why you switched Seo Joon Hee with another corpse?

249
00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:20.859
I didn't do that.

250
00:17:21.759 --> 00:17:24.970
I only sent him to Sunshine Nursing Home.

251
00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:29.470
And I sent the video to Geum Na Ra too.

252
00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.910
Then why did you go to Gyeongchun Hospital on the day...

253
00:17:33.279 --> 00:17:34.480
the corpse went missing?

254
00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:36.549
I was told to go there.

255
00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:41.019
And that person used an untraceable burner phone, right?

256
00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:44.150
Yes.

257
00:17:45.849 --> 00:17:46.990
How interesting.

258
00:17:49.859 --> 00:17:51.430
If what you say is true,

259
00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:54.059
the person planned it all strategically...

260
00:17:54.059 --> 00:17:55.700
to tie you and Seo Joon Hee together.

261
00:17:56.529 --> 00:17:57.670
But why?

262
00:17:58.069 --> 00:18:01.440
I know I wasn't a good person,

263
00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.940
but I never did anything to cause a grudge either.

264
00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:06.339
But...

265
00:18:07.579 --> 00:18:09.980
I don't know why they're doing this to me.

266
00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:16.690
Anyway, do you even believe me?

267
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:22.920
Visit your mother often.

268
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:26.289
If anything's broken, fix it right away.

269
00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:35.240
Excuse me! Please cook three orders of pork ribs nicely to go.

270
00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:36.670
Okay.

271
00:18:37.009 --> 00:18:38.210
Bring it to your mother.

272
00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:23.289
Why do you keep it so dark?

273
00:19:23.289 --> 00:19:25.049
What is it at this hour?

274
00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:27.789
You wouldn't pick up.

275
00:19:27.789 --> 00:19:29.160
I called Ms. Geum,

276
00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.789
and she said you were in the office.

277
00:19:30.789 --> 00:19:33.400
I was in the area anyway, so...

278
00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:38.029
May I come in?

279
00:19:58.819 --> 00:20:00.690
How's your wound?

280
00:20:01.559 --> 00:20:04.289
I'm used to getting hurt.

281
00:20:05.529 --> 00:20:06.559
Regardless,

282
00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.759
are you all right, Ms. Choi?

283
00:20:09.869 --> 00:20:11.730
You look like you're a bit under the weather.

284
00:20:11.869 --> 00:20:13.099
What is this regarding?

285
00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:18.039
I came to talk to you about loose ends.

286
00:20:18.769 --> 00:20:20.609
If I delay the talk, I'd be tempted to delay it again.

287
00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:25.680
Get that.

288
00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:33.259
Here you go.

289
00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:36.190
Take your bullets.

290
00:20:37.559 --> 00:20:40.299
- Here. Take your rifle too. - Sorry?

291
00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:43.769
Mr. Heo, I think everyone is here.

292
00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:46.369
The weather is nice today. Let's walk up now.

293
00:20:46.539 --> 00:20:47.769
We're waiting for one more person.

294
00:20:47.839 --> 00:20:48.839
Sorry?

295
00:20:49.569 --> 00:20:50.609
Is it that imported car's driver?

296
00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:31.950
Why is he overly motivated?

297
00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:33.779
It's his first time.

298
00:21:33.819 --> 00:21:34.849
My gosh.

299
00:21:35.079 --> 00:21:37.349
He's not so different from us except that he's rich.

300
00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:40.460
He said that animals' lives are just as valuable,

301
00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:42.559
but did you see his eyes? His eyes are shooting daggers.

302
00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:03.410
Shot.

303
00:22:14.619 --> 00:22:17.930
It's harder to shoot the targets in the field than in the range.

304
00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:22.000
How was your first hunting trip?

305
00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.230
You ought to celebrate.

306
00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:27.069
I will treat you big next time.

307
00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:31.339
Are you going to take care of it yourself?

308
00:22:31.509 --> 00:22:32.569
I should show it off.

309
00:22:43.349 --> 00:22:46.420
It's me. Set up a meet with the car dealer.

310
00:22:46.819 --> 00:22:47.819
Tell him...

311
00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:49.960
we'll pay him.

312
00:22:57.329 --> 00:23:00.539
I'm going to visit Mr. Seo and see how Joon Hee is doing.

313
00:23:00.569 --> 00:23:02.269
Okay. Tell me how it goes.

314
00:23:02.269 --> 00:23:03.269
Where are you now?

315
00:23:03.839 --> 00:23:04.839
Me?

316
00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:09.240
I'm driving now.

317
00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:14.450
Right.

318
00:23:14.819 --> 00:23:17.819
I found the person who transferred Seo Joon Hee to the nursing home...

319
00:23:17.819 --> 00:23:18.819
and sent us the video.

320
00:23:19.549 --> 00:23:20.559
Who is it?

321
00:23:20.819 --> 00:23:22.559
That's not what's important.

322
00:23:23.759 --> 00:23:25.859
I'm curious why he was instructed to do so.

323
00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:27.859
The person behind this hid Seo Joon Hee...

324
00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:30.269
and provided a hint for you to come to the nursing home.

325
00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:31.829
What could the culprit's intention be?

326
00:23:32.369 --> 00:23:33.369
I'm not sure.

327
00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:35.839
What is...

328
00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:37.670
the culprit's intention?

329
00:24:01.559 --> 00:24:05.069
What's the matter with you? What's taking you so long?

330
00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:08.000
It's been 20 minutes since I arrived, okay?

331
00:24:10.269 --> 00:24:14.339
I'm withdrawing the money from the bank.

332
00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:17.410
My gosh. I ran into a problem.

333
00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:19.750
Wait a bit longer.

334
00:24:19.779 --> 00:24:23.349
Two million dollars in cash, right?

335
00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:25.250
Can't you hear this?

336
00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:31.059
This is why I'm late.

337
00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:33.099
So shut your mouth, and wait.

338
00:24:33.099 --> 00:24:35.759
Okay, okay. Be careful, and hurry up.

339
00:24:35.759 --> 00:24:37.430
I'm about to freeze to death.

340
00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:48.579
Hey, if we were going to wait here,

341
00:24:49.539 --> 00:24:51.710
we should've pushed back the meeting.

342
00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:53.619
Just wait.

343
00:25:01.119 --> 00:25:04.289
By the way, what kind of air-fresher do you use for your car?

344
00:25:04.559 --> 00:25:07.259
It smells nasty in here. My gosh.

345
00:25:07.759 --> 00:25:08.759
Seriously.

346
00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:11.369
It smells like something is rotting.

347
00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:14.740
Stop talking nonsense, and get some sleep too.

348
00:25:15.769 --> 00:25:17.640
You're unbelievable.

349
00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:21.240
Get your car cleaned. It doesn't even cost much. What is this?

350
00:25:22.109 --> 00:25:23.250
What is this smell?

351
00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:41.059
I don't want Joon Hee...

352
00:25:42.529 --> 00:25:45.170
to be involved in this case anymore.

353
00:25:45.369 --> 00:25:47.069
Please help us, Mr. Seo.

354
00:25:47.769 --> 00:25:50.140
You adored In Ho.

355
00:25:51.009 --> 00:25:54.410
Even if so, how could I love him more than my own son?

356
00:25:57.579 --> 00:25:59.480
Let me ask you a favor.

357
00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:02.750
Leave Joon Hee...

358
00:26:04.349 --> 00:26:05.390
alone.

359
00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:24.009
Dr. Kim Jung Soo!

360
00:26:26.579 --> 00:26:27.579
What are you guys up to?

361
00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:29.240
Well...

362
00:26:30.079 --> 00:26:32.009
- Did you eat? - We just ate.

363
00:26:32.009 --> 00:26:33.779
- What about some tea then? - Would you like some?

364
00:26:33.779 --> 00:26:37.319
I know a good tea shop that's somewhere over there.

365
00:26:42.289 --> 00:26:45.289
I can't remember what I did. Hold on a second.

366
00:26:46.259 --> 00:26:49.059
I think I was at work that day.

367
00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:51.500
Yes, I was.

368
00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:53.769
I had a night shift at work that day.

369
00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:12.990
The call cannot be connected. You'll be connected to the voicemail box.

370
00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:16.559
How dare they fool me?

371
00:27:17.559 --> 00:27:19.190
Fine. All right.

372
00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:23.269
I'll go to the police with the video I have right now.

373
00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:25.769
I can just go to the station. My goodness.

374
00:27:26.099 --> 00:27:29.740
You're done for. How dare they play me like this?

375
00:27:31.339 --> 00:27:32.869
(Abuser)

376
00:27:36.609 --> 00:27:37.609
What's wrong with you?

377
00:27:37.609 --> 00:27:40.650
Well, listen. I got into a car accident on my way.

378
00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:42.279
Jerk. So what happened?

379
00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:45.490
I just got off the taxi. I'm walking there now.

380
00:27:46.289 --> 00:27:47.289
Where are you?

381
00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:50.890
Where do you think? We were supposed to meet at the underpass.

382
00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:58.400
My gosh.

383
00:28:10.849 --> 00:28:12.309
You punk.

384
00:28:14.349 --> 00:28:16.750
So you didn't get hurt, did you?

385
00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:21.720
My dash cam, GPS, and the memory card.

386
00:28:22.119 --> 00:28:23.160
Bring them to me.

387
00:28:47.619 --> 00:28:49.279
Come on.

388
00:28:55.390 --> 00:28:56.559
Do you want to check?

389
00:28:56.890 --> 00:28:57.990
I should trust you.

390
00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:00.000
That's right.

391
00:29:00.829 --> 00:29:04.630
Think about the time we spent together.

392
00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:09.539
You didn't save the file or anything, right?

393
00:29:09.539 --> 00:29:14.480
No way. You know that I'm not that big of a slime ball.

394
00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:17.750
Are you serious right now, jerk?

395
00:29:18.009 --> 00:29:19.819
How dare you talk to me so rudely?

396
00:29:20.279 --> 00:29:22.920
Hey, am I your friend?

397
00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:24.750
Am I?

398
00:29:26.289 --> 00:29:27.289
Hey.

399
00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:32.359
Let me slap you...

400
00:29:33.259 --> 00:29:35.400
for one last time and wrap this up.

401
00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:38.529
I gave you a lot of money too.

402
00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:41.000
This one is worth two million dollars. Okay?

403
00:29:41.769 --> 00:29:44.140
Just... Just one slap then.

404
00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:45.910
Come.

405
00:29:47.579 --> 00:29:48.880
Go easy on me.

406
00:29:49.539 --> 00:29:51.049
You punk.

407
00:30:14.099 --> 00:30:15.099
Shot.

408
00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:32.190
(Return)

409
00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:33.920
- What is this? - Your alibi.

410
00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:36.259
She's so lovable.

411
00:30:36.259 --> 00:30:39.190
I'm seeing your child for the first time.

412
00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:41.930
Hey, hey, hey! Get your act together.

413
00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:43.599
You'll take the fall.

414
00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:45.369
Darn it!

415
00:30:45.369 --> 00:30:47.470
I think it's related to that case.

416
00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:48.470
Please explain.

417
00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:51.470
Are you sure you and Byung Gi spoke on the phone?

418
00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:54.380
You seem convinced that he cannot speak on the phone.

419
00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:57.250
Bum. Our good boy, Bum. What will you do now?
