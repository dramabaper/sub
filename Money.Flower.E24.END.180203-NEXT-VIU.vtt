1
00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:22.650
You're having champagne, ma'am?

2
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.159
Make some snack Pil Joo likes.

3
00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.100
What about the thing I gave you...

4
00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:36.960
to put in the treats for Mooshimjae?

5
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.369
I threw it away.

6
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.240
Why wouldn't you follow my order?

7
00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:47.280
Why would you throw it away when I didn't order?

8
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.679
I need it right now.

9
00:01:23.379 --> 00:01:24.450
Ms. Icheon.

10
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.049
Attorney Kang, please stop Executive Jung.

11
00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.489
Executive Jung...

12
00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.090
gave it to me to put in the treats for Mooshimjae.

13
00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.129
I didn't put it in because something didn't sit right with me.

14
00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:46.570
I hoped that I was wrong, but I was afraid.

15
00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:50.170
So I poured it on a silver spoon. And the color changed.

16
00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:53.980
I think that it could be poison.

17
00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:58.249
But...

18
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.150
she asked me for it because she needs it tonight.

19
00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.290
When I told her that I threw it away,

20
00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:06.249
she got so upset.

21
00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.459
I don't feel comfortable with this.

22
00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:14.600
Attorney Kang,

23
00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:18.970
please stop Executive Jung.

24
00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:38.690
Not those flowers.

25
00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:41.119
They don't suit tonight's meeting.

26
00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:43.290
If you accompany and pick the flowers,

27
00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.760
I will make a centerpiece with your selection.

28
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:04.209
How was...

29
00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:06.339
my performance?

30
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.390
Someone in Mooshimwon...

31
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.130
still looks after you...

32
00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:28.630
fortunately.

33
00:04:32.269 --> 00:04:34.800
You don't have the right to end your life, Executive Jung.

34
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.140
You will...

35
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.539
have to pay for what you did in prison.

36
00:04:44.209 --> 00:04:45.209
Detectives...

37
00:04:46.149 --> 00:04:47.519
will be here soon.

38
00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:48.539
Mom.

39
00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:20.229
(Final Episode)

40
00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.649
Take care of the house.

41
00:07:31.979 --> 00:07:33.110
I have done nothing wrong.

42
00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:35.320
My innocence will be proven soon.

43
00:07:38.349 --> 00:07:39.349
I'll be back.

44
00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:42.560
Secretary Ahn.

45
00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.289
Contact Attorney Park and...

46
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.099
I'm sorry, Executive Jung.

47
00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:49.300
My duty...

48
00:07:50.329 --> 00:07:51.599
ends here.

49
00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:02.479
Hee Young.

50
00:08:04.579 --> 00:08:06.310
Were you working for Pil Joo?

51
00:08:08.219 --> 00:08:09.450
Since when?

52
00:08:17.959 --> 00:08:19.089
Let's go.

53
00:08:24.729 --> 00:08:27.339
Mom. I'll follow you.

54
00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:43.909
If you can't understand the will your mother left,

55
00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:47.449
I wonder how you passed the bar exam with that brain of yours.

56
00:09:57.730 --> 00:09:59.289
You cannot waste...

57
00:09:59.529 --> 00:10:01.960
your valuable life by letting your hatred and anger...

58
00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.470
rule your life.

59
00:10:05.399 --> 00:10:06.669
I want my son...

60
00:10:07.199 --> 00:10:09.569
to grow up healthy...

61
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.140
and live a happy life.

62
00:10:13.669 --> 00:10:15.210
You can never be happy in a life...

63
00:10:15.679 --> 00:10:17.710
where a revenge becomes your goal.

64
00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:20.350
Pil Joo.

65
00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:24.220
Please keep this in mind.

66
00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:38.569
Mom, you know nothing.

67
00:10:53.549 --> 00:10:56.380
I read my mother's will again.

68
00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:58.620
Just like you said,

69
00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:00.860
I have misunderstood it.

70
00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:05.059
But I don't regret reading it wrong.

71
00:11:06.289 --> 00:11:07.559
Even if I understood it correctly,

72
00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.230
I wouldn't have listened to my mom.

73
00:11:10.699 --> 00:11:11.970
What a brat.

74
00:11:12.269 --> 00:11:13.970
You're one stubborn punk.

75
00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:15.569
I didn't...

76
00:11:16.299 --> 00:11:19.409
recognize some parts in the last section of the will.

77
00:11:19.569 --> 00:11:22.110
My mom's wish was for me to show the Jangs...

78
00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:25.909
that I have grown into a fine man...

79
00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:29.620
despite their attempt to murder me.

80
00:11:30.049 --> 00:11:32.049
I have lived with the family of businessmen...

81
00:11:32.649 --> 00:11:35.960
for 20 years, and the best success I could have is owning a business.

82
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:38.029
That's the only trade I've learned.

83
00:11:38.289 --> 00:11:42.230
What a punk. How dare you blame me for your mistake?

84
00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.699
If you don't comply with what I'm about to tell you,

85
00:11:46.069 --> 00:11:47.899
I will go into the river...

86
00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.610
Jung Mal Ran threw me and will not come out from it.

87
00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:53.439
Is that a threat?

88
00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:57.649
Do you think your life means anything to me?

89
00:11:57.679 --> 00:12:00.250
I'm the most competent grandson among the ones you have.

90
00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:04.620
You don't have an alternative except me.

91
00:12:05.919 --> 00:12:07.990
You ungrateful punk.

92
00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:09.490
Two things.

93
00:12:10.529 --> 00:12:12.559
First, you must...

94
00:12:14.029 --> 00:12:17.169
end inheriting Cheong A based on hereditary factors.

95
00:12:18.269 --> 00:12:22.100
Only then Cheong A which you love the most in this world...

96
00:12:22.669 --> 00:12:25.439
will flourish for a long time.

97
00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:27.279
What did you say?

98
00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:30.380
If you didn't insist on inheriting the company to a Jang,

99
00:12:31.679 --> 00:12:32.750
Executive Jung...

100
00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:36.220
wouldn't have tried to kill me, Kyung Cheon,

101
00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:38.949
and my mom.

102
00:12:42.019 --> 00:12:45.929
You made Yeo Cheon and Boo Cheon compete against each other,

103
00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:48.159
but...

104
00:12:49.199 --> 00:12:51.630
there wasn't much difference in the end.

105
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:53.569
So...

106
00:12:54.539 --> 00:12:56.370
what's your point?

107
00:12:57.210 --> 00:12:59.710
You must construct a system that...

108
00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:03.340
the independent board of executives will hold an election...

109
00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:05.750
to select the CEO who will take responsibility...

110
00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:08.179
of the company.

111
00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:12.590
The second condition is...

112
00:13:14.289 --> 00:13:15.760
that you must invest...

113
00:13:16.559 --> 00:13:18.689
all of your slush fund in Cheong A Bio's research...

114
00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:20.460
for developing the new medicine.

115
00:13:20.929 --> 00:13:23.799
Unbelievable. You're testing my patience.

116
00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:25.830
Only then,

117
00:13:26.399 --> 00:13:27.899
even after your death,

118
00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:34.610
Cheong A will survive for 100 years...

119
00:13:35.279 --> 00:13:37.510
or even longer than that.

120
00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:41.220
You may pass away,

121
00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.789
but Cheong A will remain.

122
00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:46.789
Cheong A...

123
00:13:48.019 --> 00:13:49.059
Jang Kook Hwan built.

124
00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:07.010
It's a system that independent board of executives...

125
00:14:07.909 --> 00:14:10.480
will hold an election to select the CEO of the company.

126
00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:15.120
You can still become the CEO even if you're part of the founder's family.

127
00:14:15.649 --> 00:14:17.919
All you need to do is pass the system.

128
00:14:20.519 --> 00:14:21.890
The position cannot be handed to you...

129
00:14:22.189 --> 00:14:24.429
just because you're from the founder's family.

130
00:14:25.559 --> 00:14:28.799
The objective is that the selection must be solely based on the merits.

131
00:14:30.769 --> 00:14:32.169
If Cheong A thrives under the CEO's management,

132
00:14:32.929 --> 00:14:34.240
we'll keep the CEO,

133
00:14:34.539 --> 00:14:36.539
but if the CEO harms the company, the position will be taken away.

134
00:14:39.539 --> 00:14:40.779
All right.

135
00:14:40.779 --> 00:14:43.779
The basic salary is 5 million dollars...

136
00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:46.309
with 100 percent bonus of the basic salary.

137
00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:47.549
If you make a good outcome,

138
00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:50.120
you will receive total 100 million dollars a year.

139
00:14:51.289 --> 00:14:52.750
You can also receive it as stocks if you want.

140
00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:54.519
Retirement pay is separate.

141
00:14:54.689 --> 00:14:55.760
Father.

142
00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:59.029
Did you really approve this?

143
00:14:59.029 --> 00:15:01.299
It's all for Cheong A.

144
00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:03.870
We're not going to decide it now.

145
00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:07.140
We only suggest it, and the committee will decide it.

146
00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.699
- I can't agree... - You will...

147
00:15:10.199 --> 00:15:12.809
have to agree to it eventually.

148
00:15:17.179 --> 00:15:18.309
Okay.

149
00:15:18.549 --> 00:15:21.549
I'll take that as everyone agreed. Mr. Woo.

150
00:15:21.549 --> 00:15:22.720
Yes, sir.

151
00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:25.390
Take this decision to the committee...

152
00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:27.319
and discuss it further.

153
00:15:27.319 --> 00:15:28.490
Yes, sir.

154
00:15:31.059 --> 00:15:33.460
Grandfather. I'll drive you today.

155
00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:36.029
I'll drive you today, sir.

156
00:15:36.899 --> 00:15:37.970
Sure.

157
00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:11.029
Chairman Jang Kook Hwan. Chairman Jang Kook Hwan.

158
00:16:11.769 --> 00:16:14.000
Father. It's me.

159
00:16:14.899 --> 00:16:17.409
It's me, Jang Yoo Chul.

160
00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:18.769
I'm here.

161
00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:20.840
I'm here.

162
00:16:20.939 --> 00:16:23.380
Father. Your son...

163
00:16:36.289 --> 00:16:37.460
Kim Yoo Chul.

164
00:16:38.689 --> 00:16:40.760
It hasn't been long since I gave you a large sum of money.

165
00:16:40.799 --> 00:16:42.630
It's Jang Yoo Chul.

166
00:16:44.769 --> 00:16:46.970
Did you get rid of other children out of wedlock...

167
00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:49.269
to take Cheong A all to yourself?

168
00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:58.679
Put some effort.

169
00:17:00.309 --> 00:17:01.750
Don't live like this.

170
00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:02.919
You jerk...

171
00:17:03.279 --> 00:17:06.290
Hey. You jerk.

172
00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:08.459
You're such a jerk. You...

173
00:17:08.659 --> 00:17:11.159
Do you think you're going to be okay?

174
00:17:11.259 --> 00:17:15.060
You'll end up miserable too.

175
00:17:15.459 --> 00:17:19.030
According to the official of Cheong A Group,

176
00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:22.600
the committee has decided to change the group's management system.

177
00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:24.709
Let's hear what it is about.

178
00:17:24.969 --> 00:17:27.409
Cheong A owner family has announced to end hereditary management...

179
00:17:27.509 --> 00:17:31.209
and proposed to change to a professional executive system.

180
00:17:31.749 --> 00:17:33.949
Also, Honorary Chairman Jang Kook Hwan...

181
00:17:33.979 --> 00:17:37.390
gave 4 billion dollars for Cheong A Bio Research fund.

182
00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:39.919
Chairman Jang Kook Hwan stated his view that...

183
00:17:39.919 --> 00:17:43.060
a new development of medicine will feed the whole nation.

184
00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:45.330
Cheong A Group...

185
00:17:46.929 --> 00:17:49.499
When did I say I'll give four billion dollars?

186
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:51.370
What is this all about?

187
00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:54.340
Continue to make a social donation?

188
00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:57.409
It seems late, but your path will...

189
00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.540
influence other group leaders.

190
00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:04.050
Many people have said they're amazed by you and Cheong A.

191
00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:06.850
You played with my money.

192
00:18:06.909 --> 00:18:08.219
You're bold in word only.

193
00:18:08.479 --> 00:18:09.620
Go away.

194
00:18:11.989 --> 00:18:13.120
Take a rest, sir.

195
00:18:23.729 --> 00:18:25.530
Chairman Jang. Chairman Jang.

196
00:18:28.969 --> 00:18:30.040
Grandfather.

197
00:18:42.749 --> 00:18:46.890
How is he today?

198
00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:48.790
He's recovering now.

199
00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:50.729
He'll be able to talk soon.

200
00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:11.550
Are you discharged?

201
00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:14.179
Yes.

202
00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:21.689
Chairman Jang.

203
00:19:25.189 --> 00:19:26.229
I will...

204
00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:29.300
leave my favorite book of poetry.

205
00:19:32.729 --> 00:19:35.439
("Giant Root")

206
00:19:35.439 --> 00:19:36.939
When I was in a labor movement,

207
00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:39.340
I read those poems to my wife...

208
00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:42.439
on my way back home holding my wife's hand...

209
00:19:43.179 --> 00:19:45.550
from the factory.

210
00:19:47.449 --> 00:19:48.550
My wife...

211
00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:51.890
likes Poet Kim Soo Young.

212
00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:56.290
He probably has a lot to say to you.

213
00:19:57.159 --> 00:19:58.890
He must feel stifling.

214
00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:03.729
That healthy old man can't speak.

215
00:20:04.199 --> 00:20:05.370
Chairman Jang.

216
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:08.040
Now that...

217
00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.810
I've come to my senses,

218
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:14.580
I realized...

219
00:20:14.679 --> 00:20:18.050
that I don't even deserve to hold a press conference.

220
00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:23.280
I'll turn myself in to the prosecutor's office first.

221
00:20:24.749 --> 00:20:26.149
You can take time.

222
00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:58.290
(Investigation on slush fund of Cheong A Group and Na Gi Chul)

223
00:21:08.759 --> 00:21:12.300
The former Congressman Na Gi Chul is suspected for receiving bribery...

224
00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:13.669
is in custody.

225
00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:16.300
For 5 years from October 2012...

226
00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:18.509
to September 2017,

227
00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:21.179
he received slush fund from Cheong A...

228
00:21:21.209 --> 00:21:23.749
and bribed major personnel...

229
00:21:23.749 --> 00:21:26.179
in politics.

230
00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:30.350
The prosecutors are planning to investigate related people soon.

231
00:21:35.959 --> 00:21:36.959
Mom.

232
00:21:39.159 --> 00:21:41.330
I'm just thankful...

233
00:21:41.929 --> 00:21:42.959
that he is alive.

234
00:21:46.729 --> 00:21:48.070
I'm going to rest.

235
00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:03.719
Cheong A Foundation's...

236
00:22:04.419 --> 00:22:05.749
double account book.

237
00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:14.600
You've...

238
00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:16.199
deciphered the code.

239
00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:18.229
I couldn't.

240
00:22:19.929 --> 00:22:21.169
Attorney Kang gave it to me.

241
00:22:23.669 --> 00:22:24.709
This data...

242
00:22:25.469 --> 00:22:28.679
contains the process of how Cheong A Foundation...

243
00:22:28.939 --> 00:22:30.340
prepared the fund...

244
00:22:31.149 --> 00:22:32.709
they gave to Congressman Na...

245
00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:34.350
and the amount.

246
00:22:36.979 --> 00:22:38.149
If it's revealed,

247
00:22:39.989 --> 00:22:42.290
Pil Joo won't be safe either.

248
00:22:43.459 --> 00:22:45.330
I think Attorney Kang is prepared.

249
00:22:46.429 --> 00:22:48.630
He's prepared to go to prison...

250
00:22:49.899 --> 00:22:52.699
to ruin the Jangs.

251
00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:12.689
Father...

252
00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:15.959
doesn't know how Cheong A Foundation prepared the fund.

253
00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:20.759
The data I'm giving you...

254
00:23:21.959 --> 00:23:23.969
is from Kang Pil Joo.

255
00:23:25.399 --> 00:23:29.100
Why would Chairman Kang Pil Joo give you this data?

256
00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:30.409
It'd put him in danger too.

257
00:23:30.409 --> 00:23:32.009
He didn't only give me the data.

258
00:23:33.239 --> 00:23:34.939
He also saved my father...

259
00:23:35.479 --> 00:23:36.979
and protected him.

260
00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:40.179
If it wasn't for him,

261
00:23:41.419 --> 00:23:42.419
the truth...

262
00:23:43.149 --> 00:23:44.949
would've been buried for ever.

263
00:23:47.419 --> 00:23:48.719
I have a favor to ask you.

264
00:23:50.159 --> 00:23:52.530
Please make favorable arrangements for Kang Pil Joo...

265
00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:54.499
who became a whistle blower.

266
00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:59.729
Without him,

267
00:24:00.229 --> 00:24:01.939
you could've never revealed...

268
00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:04.239
the crime of Cheong A's owner family.

269
00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:11.580
(Na Mo Hyun received help from Chairman Kang Pil Joo.)

270
00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:13.820
Since it is humane act...

271
00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:15.580
The former Congressman Na Gi Chul...

272
00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:17.590
was threatened by Cheong A's owner family...

273
00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:22.659
who was afraid of revealing the truth...

274
00:24:23.419 --> 00:24:25.330
and was instigated to commit suicide.

275
00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:29.159
Kang Pil Joo disguised Na Gi Chul's death...

276
00:24:29.429 --> 00:24:31.030
and protected him until recently.

277
00:24:31.229 --> 00:24:34.770
In the reported document, she said she was sexually harassed...

278
00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:35.770
Father.

279
00:24:36.469 --> 00:24:38.209
People's comments say...

280
00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:41.009
that Kang Pil Joo's act of whistle blowing was brave.

281
00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:43.110
They're complimenting him.

282
00:24:45.009 --> 00:24:47.820
Moving onto the next news. Executive Na Mo Hyun of Cheong A...

283
00:24:47.919 --> 00:24:49.449
Release the public relations team immediately...

284
00:24:49.449 --> 00:24:51.290
and report that Na Mo Hyun was lying...

285
00:24:51.489 --> 00:24:54.320
and there's no such thing as...

286
00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:56.060
a double account book in Cheong A Foundation.

287
00:24:56.159 --> 00:24:57.530
Her data is fake.

288
00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:00.999
The data is real.

289
00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:03.159
I will...

290
00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:05.969
reveal the details at the prosecution's investigation.

291
00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:09.100
Pil Joo.

292
00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:11.009
(Chairman Kang Pil Joo confirmed the existence of double account book.)

293
00:25:11.009 --> 00:25:12.810
In the investigation, Chairman Kang Pil Joo...

294
00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:15.080
That tiger's child, Kang Pil Joo...

295
00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:17.580
is taking all of us up...

296
00:25:19.149 --> 00:25:21.249
in his mouth.

297
00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:31.090
Mo Hyun.

298
00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:35.399
I'm sorry.

299
00:25:39.699 --> 00:25:41.370
I ruined and invalidated...

300
00:25:43.969 --> 00:25:45.340
what has to be...

301
00:25:46.439 --> 00:25:49.179
the happiest time...

302
00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:52.749
in your life...

303
00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:58.919
due to my greed.

304
00:26:04.659 --> 00:26:05.759
I'm sorry.

305
00:26:10.469 --> 00:26:11.669
It's fine.

306
00:26:15.739 --> 00:26:16.969
It's fine.

307
00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:21.880
I'm proud of you, Dad.

308
00:26:25.149 --> 00:26:28.479
Thank you for returning to Dad...

309
00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:31.850
that I was always proud of.

310
00:26:35.959 --> 00:26:36.959
Honey.

311
00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:40.999
I'll forgive you now.

312
00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:45.469
I've waited until you apologize...

313
00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:48.140
to Mo Hyun sincerely.

314
00:26:50.509 --> 00:26:52.840
I'll serve you with my best while you're in prison.

315
00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:57.310
You just need to promise me one thing.

316
00:26:57.850 --> 00:26:59.149
You will not...

317
00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:06.520
- get sick in there. - Honey.

318
00:27:15.699 --> 00:27:19.370
(Na Mo Hyun)

319
00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:28.880
(Resignation)

320
00:27:48.259 --> 00:27:49.300
Pil Joo.

321
00:27:51.169 --> 00:27:52.499
How...

322
00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:55.899
The Jangs and I are willingly getting investigated...

323
00:27:56.399 --> 00:27:58.870
by the prosecutor's office...

324
00:27:59.469 --> 00:28:01.179
so that we're on trial without detention.

325
00:28:04.409 --> 00:28:06.550
(Resignation)

326
00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.219
Aide Yang told me.

327
00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:12.419
You're going to quit the foundation...

328
00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:16.060
- and join the politics. - Yes.

329
00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:19.929
I'm not going to rush.

330
00:28:20.659 --> 00:28:22.530
I'm going to start small.

331
00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:24.270
How about...

332
00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:26.729
starting politics small...

333
00:28:28.399 --> 00:28:31.610
from here in Cheong A Foundation?

334
00:28:33.939 --> 00:28:35.780
You can work as a director of the foundation...

335
00:28:36.409 --> 00:28:38.509
and make a foundation rule...

336
00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:41.749
of donating the corporate profit to the society.

337
00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:45.919
You can run the foundation clean so that there will never be...

338
00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:48.719
black money in the foundation.

339
00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:52.360
That also needs...

340
00:28:52.989 --> 00:28:55.630
as much political power as entering the legislation.

341
00:28:58.370 --> 00:29:01.739
It's probably not easy for you to work here...

342
00:29:02.969 --> 00:29:05.969
since this is where Congressman Na's...

343
00:29:06.409 --> 00:29:07.880
slush fund came from.

344
00:29:10.679 --> 00:29:12.610
I'll think about it.

345
00:29:14.719 --> 00:29:15.780
I know...

346
00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:22.860
this will sound preposterous,

347
00:29:25.729 --> 00:29:27.499
but this is the only word...

348
00:29:28.929 --> 00:29:30.429
in this world.

349
00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:37.909
I'm sorry.

350
00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:41.840
I know...

351
00:29:43.979 --> 00:29:45.780
you will not forgive me...

352
00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:49.919
for using you for my revenge.

353
00:30:02.429 --> 00:30:03.499
I'm sorry.

354
00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:10.100
My father.

355
00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:13.040
Me.

356
00:30:15.239 --> 00:30:18.179
Boo Cheon and his mother.

357
00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:22.350
Seo Won and Ha Jung.

358
00:30:26.189 --> 00:30:28.719
We all owe you our lives.

359
00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:34.259
You can take that...

360
00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:37.630
as a payment...

361
00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:39.929
now.

362
00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:47.580
I was always afraid to see you.

363
00:30:50.679 --> 00:30:51.949
I thought...

364
00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:56.419
you'd reach your hand out to me.

365
00:30:59.249 --> 00:31:01.820
I thought I might stop you from leaving.

366
00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:06.590
We both...

367
00:31:09.199 --> 00:31:10.699
want each other.

368
00:31:12.999 --> 00:31:16.040
After making the suggestion that you can't reject,

369
00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:19.110
I wondered what I should do.

370
00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:24.350
The distance between you and me.

371
00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:27.219
I'm well aware...

372
00:31:28.179 --> 00:31:31.320
that you can't reduce that distance.

373
00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:35.120
The reason you didn't come close to me...

374
00:31:37.729 --> 00:31:39.060
was to...

375
00:31:40.699 --> 00:31:42.030
keep your manner...

376
00:31:42.959 --> 00:31:44.830
to me.

377
00:31:48.239 --> 00:31:49.340
So...

378
00:31:50.439 --> 00:31:52.810
I never expect that distance...

379
00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:54.580
to be shortened.

380
00:31:58.749 --> 00:32:00.209
I'm going to...

381
00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:05.719
keep the man I saved...

382
00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:12.590
and the man who saved me...

383
00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.669
in my heart.

384
00:32:36.693 --> 00:32:41.693
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E24 Money Flower "Fly High"</font>
<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

385
00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:01.580
I'll leave now.

386
00:34:53.549 --> 00:34:54.759
Soo Man.

387
00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:04.569
Honey,

388
00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:07.100
you came back alive.

389
00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:13.270
You told me that you'd go to...

390
00:35:14.609 --> 00:35:15.940
Ahn Ho Kyung,

391
00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:18.279
Eun Cheon,

392
00:35:18.909 --> 00:35:21.250
and Kyung Cheon that day.

393
00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:25.650
That's why I did it.

394
00:35:33.859 --> 00:35:34.900
I regretted a lot...

395
00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:37.929
what I did...

396
00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:40.469
to you.

397
00:35:41.239 --> 00:35:44.710
So I tried so hard to blow life back into you.

398
00:35:49.339 --> 00:35:52.580
I desperately hoped that you would get up...

399
00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:54.350
so that you could...

400
00:35:55.850 --> 00:35:57.049
scold me...

401
00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:59.690
and yell at me.

402
00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:09.000
But Father removed...

403
00:36:10.159 --> 00:36:11.670
your respirator...

404
00:36:12.199 --> 00:36:13.500
and made you die.

405
00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:26.150
And you rose from the dead...

406
00:36:27.009 --> 00:36:29.679
and came to see me.

407
00:36:37.929 --> 00:36:39.089
Pil Joo,

408
00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:41.429
get out immediately.

409
00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:45.429
Now.

410
00:36:54.909 --> 00:36:56.980
Honey, where are you going?

411
00:36:57.409 --> 00:36:59.679
Now that you returned alive,

412
00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:01.449
you should be with me.

413
00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:03.920
Are you going to Ahn Ho Kyung again?

414
00:37:04.719 --> 00:37:06.989
Come back! Please!

415
00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:09.390
I said come back here!

416
00:37:21.069 --> 00:37:22.440
I'll kill him again.

417
00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:24.670
I will kill...

418
00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:26.670
all of them...

419
00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:28.879
just like I killed Soo Man.

420
00:38:15.589 --> 00:38:17.089
What brings you here at this late hour?

421
00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:18.429
Pil Joo,

422
00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:22.460
I'm leaving Mooshimwon.

423
00:38:27.339 --> 00:38:28.500
I already moved...

424
00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:30.870
all my stuff out this afternoon.

425
00:38:38.379 --> 00:38:40.049
I must've left already.

426
00:38:41.949 --> 00:38:43.420
I thought I could leave this place...

427
00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:45.690
only if I did it all of a sudden.

428
00:38:46.719 --> 00:38:48.159
After all my stuff left,

429
00:38:49.989 --> 00:38:51.759
Mooshimwon felt so strange...

430
00:38:54.199 --> 00:38:55.529
even though I was...

431
00:38:56.629 --> 00:38:57.770
born and raised here.

432
00:39:26.759 --> 00:39:28.060
Now that you know...

433
00:39:29.699 --> 00:39:32.100
how Vice Chairman Jang Soo Man passed away,

434
00:39:33.629 --> 00:39:36.299
I guess your revenge is over.

435
00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:39.810
Are you happy now?

436
00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:45.409
Pil Joo,

437
00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:54.790
have you ever envied me?

438
00:39:57.790 --> 00:39:59.460
I have envied you a lot.

439
00:40:01.029 --> 00:40:02.429
You're not only strong-minded...

440
00:40:03.529 --> 00:40:05.600
but also good at fighting and studying.

441
00:40:07.069 --> 00:40:09.299
You never back off,

442
00:40:09.299 --> 00:40:12.069
and everyone in Mooshimwon liked you so much.

443
00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:15.679
I even felt jealous...

444
00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:20.049
about the absence of your mother.

445
00:40:22.549 --> 00:40:23.920
But you turned out...

446
00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:26.890
to be the most pitiful guy.

447
00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:30.529
You're such a great guy.

448
00:40:32.089 --> 00:40:34.960
But you've devoted your entire life to a revenge,

449
00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:38.600
and that's really sad,

450
00:40:40.330 --> 00:40:41.370
Pil Joo.

451
00:40:41.739 --> 00:40:44.609
Even if I could go back to the old days,

452
00:40:48.909 --> 00:40:50.379
I'm sure I'd choose to live like this.

453
00:40:52.779 --> 00:40:53.879
You would.

454
00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:56.650
That's who you are.

455
00:41:02.989 --> 00:41:04.029
Pil Joo.

456
00:41:05.730 --> 00:41:06.759
You once...

457
00:41:09.359 --> 00:41:12.170
worked just for me.

458
00:41:14.199 --> 00:41:16.140
And this is the end of our story.

459
00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:21.879
We might run into each other someday,

460
00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:27.250
but let's just ignore each other.

461
00:41:31.949 --> 00:41:33.390
I insist.

462
00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:43.500
If you say so.

463
00:42:19.830 --> 00:42:21.000
Goodbye.

464
00:42:56.069 --> 00:42:57.839
The defendants...

465
00:42:58.509 --> 00:43:00.739
privatized the corporate asset...

466
00:43:01.379 --> 00:43:04.750
and caused substantial damage to property of the shareholders.

467
00:43:05.350 --> 00:43:07.480
They also offered money to a politician,

468
00:43:08.449 --> 00:43:10.549
which was the slush fund they created in the process.

469
00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:14.219
The charges are deemed to be grave.

470
00:43:15.290 --> 00:43:16.359
However,

471
00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:18.159
considering that the defendants...

472
00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:21.929
admitted their guilt, cooperated with the investigation,

473
00:43:22.830 --> 00:43:26.670
and pledged to pay their forfeit in a faithful manner,

474
00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:29.799
penalty was made favorably...

475
00:43:30.370 --> 00:43:32.969
as follows.

476
00:43:34.810 --> 00:43:36.480
Defendant Jang Kook Hwan...

477
00:43:37.179 --> 00:43:38.580
is sentenced to seven years in prison.

478
00:43:39.810 --> 00:43:43.520
Defendant Jang Seong Man is sentenced to seven years in prison.

479
00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:47.259
Defendant Kang Pil Joo...

480
00:43:47.719 --> 00:43:49.620
is sentenced to three years in prison.

481
00:43:51.529 --> 00:43:53.290
Defendant Jung Mal Ran...

482
00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.330
is sentenced to three years in prison.

483
00:43:56.199 --> 00:43:58.429
Defendant Jang Yeo Cheon...

484
00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:01.040
is sentenced to a year in prison.

485
00:45:51.810 --> 00:45:53.150
You should get back up again.

486
00:45:54.449 --> 00:45:55.949
I can't do things without you.

487
00:46:10.469 --> 00:46:11.699
I asked you...

488
00:46:13.129 --> 00:46:14.799
to help my lonely son,

489
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.069
Boo Cheon become the chairman.

490
00:46:19.109 --> 00:46:22.679
You did a perfect job fulfilling my request.

491
00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:27.549
You're an amazing man.

492
00:46:38.589 --> 00:46:41.259
Pil Joo, Boo Cheon is here.

493
00:46:41.759 --> 00:46:44.830
He's the chairman of Cheong A Bio. He's here.

494
00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:50.140
I should get going.

495
00:47:12.359 --> 00:47:13.429
Mom.

496
00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:24.540
Pil Joo's father.

497
00:47:26.170 --> 00:47:27.540
And my father.

498
00:47:29.509 --> 00:47:32.250
You killed them all.

499
00:47:35.549 --> 00:47:37.520
What did you want to get...

500
00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:41.060
by doing all that?

501
00:47:45.589 --> 00:47:47.759
How can I be so fine...

502
00:47:49.859 --> 00:47:51.900
even after finding it out?

503
00:47:58.909 --> 00:48:00.440
Because you stole a march on me.

504
00:48:02.409 --> 00:48:03.850
That's why I can't be insane.

505
00:48:12.319 --> 00:48:14.390
I want to lose my mind.

506
00:48:16.589 --> 00:48:18.089
But if I do,

507
00:48:21.359 --> 00:48:23.060
we will end up too miserable.

508
00:48:25.629 --> 00:48:27.699
That's why I'm struggling not to lose my mind.

509
00:48:33.839 --> 00:48:34.839
Boo Cheon.

510
00:48:39.850 --> 00:48:41.250
Cheong A is mine.

511
00:48:43.219 --> 00:48:46.049
And you are my son.

512
00:48:48.089 --> 00:48:49.460
Cheong A is yours.

513
00:49:07.909 --> 00:49:10.609
When you come to your senses...

514
00:49:11.250 --> 00:49:12.580
and receive punishment,

515
00:49:15.719 --> 00:49:18.219
I'll stay with you all the time.

516
00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:20.219
So trust me...

517
00:49:21.719 --> 00:49:23.219
and come to your senses.

518
00:49:25.989 --> 00:49:28.100
We will hold out together.

519
00:49:58.259 --> 00:49:59.290
Please.

520
00:50:56.819 --> 00:50:57.890
Chairman.

521
00:51:07.359 --> 00:51:10.299
- You're back. - How have you been?

522
00:51:12.569 --> 00:51:14.000
(Chairman Woo Chang Sun)

523
00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:17.540
- Chairman Woo. - I've been so stressed out...

524
00:51:17.569 --> 00:51:19.409
that I suffer from irritable colon syndrome.

525
00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:23.850
I go to the bathroom too often that I can't even work well.

526
00:51:28.150 --> 00:51:29.250
Well...

527
00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:31.949
I'll submit my resignation.

528
00:51:32.219 --> 00:51:33.690
You should be back.

529
00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:37.390
I'm here to say goodbye...

530
00:51:38.190 --> 00:51:39.259
to Cheong A.

531
00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:41.359
What will you do from now on?

532
00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:44.770
I won't do anything.

533
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:19.270
When...

534
00:52:20.230 --> 00:52:21.270
Today.

535
00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:23.600
All right.

536
00:52:28.779 --> 00:52:32.009
I didn't attend the general meeting of stockholders the other day.

537
00:52:32.009 --> 00:52:35.080
Why does it say Cheong A Foundation voted yes?

538
00:52:36.049 --> 00:52:38.489
I heard you submitted your power of attorney.

539
00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:43.560
Where are you going?

540
00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:55.699
I'm going up there.

541
00:52:56.839 --> 00:52:59.640
I want to go up high...

542
00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:02.210
before I leave.

543
00:53:12.449 --> 00:53:15.420
Pil Joo, I wrapped everything up.

544
00:53:16.190 --> 00:53:17.560
I'm going back home.

545
00:53:18.759 --> 00:53:22.159
Once I arrive at Gapyeong, I won't be anywhere near computers again.

546
00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:27.239
This is...

547
00:53:28.670 --> 00:53:31.440
my last time to talk to you on the phone.

548
00:53:37.710 --> 00:53:40.949
All right. You can keep away from everyone.

549
00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:44.420
Thank you.

550
00:53:45.989 --> 00:53:47.020
Yong Goo.

551
00:53:49.589 --> 00:53:50.960
I appreciate everything what you've done.

552
00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:54.500
You should be happy.

553
00:53:57.500 --> 00:53:58.569
I'm hanging up.

554
00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:09.580
Pil Joo.

555
00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:13.480
You did a good job.

556
00:54:54.020 --> 00:54:55.190
Kim Yoo Chul.

557
00:54:55.420 --> 00:54:58.060
I said I'm Jang Yoo Chul, you jerk.

558
00:54:58.929 --> 00:55:02.029
How many more times do I have to tell you?

559
00:56:56.140 --> 00:56:57.409
Sir,

560
00:56:58.710 --> 00:57:01.219
the weather is lovely.

561
00:57:03.379 --> 00:57:05.650
The stock price of Cheong A's subsidiary companies...

562
00:57:05.650 --> 00:57:07.290
remains mostly unchanged,

563
00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:09.759
but some have dropped a bit.

564
00:57:11.429 --> 00:57:14.859
Cheong A is looking for a new CEO.

565
00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:19.500
The former CEO was expelled...

566
00:57:20.129 --> 00:57:21.469
as he wasn't capable enough.

567
00:57:36.449 --> 00:57:38.290
The dividend of Cheong A shares...

568
00:57:38.949 --> 00:57:41.489
that the foundation owns shrank a lot in the past two years.

569
00:57:41.989 --> 00:57:45.259
We need to reduce the events to gain favor...

570
00:57:45.890 --> 00:57:46.989
with the government or particular groups.

571
00:57:47.929 --> 00:57:51.000
If we waste money on such things, we won't have any for those in need.

572
00:57:51.230 --> 00:57:52.569
Yes, ma'am.

573
00:57:53.069 --> 00:57:54.170
I'm leaving.

I'm giving you back your name.

590
01:00:23.790 --> 01:00:26.290
It had been very useful.

591
