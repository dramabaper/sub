00:00:08.685 --> 00:00:10.585
(Episode 15)

2
00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:14.255
You were...

3
00:00:15.386 --> 00:00:16.956
my husband.

4
00:00:20.927 --> 00:00:23.326
You'll remember me.

5
00:00:28.436 --> 00:00:30.166
You were my husband.

6
00:00:32.667 --> 00:00:35.376
You must give me the love that you failed to give.

7
00:01:05.236 --> 00:01:08.176
Try to remember me.

8
00:01:14.947 --> 00:01:16.016
What's wrong?

9
00:01:16.316 --> 00:01:17.316
Nothing.

10
00:01:18.286 --> 00:01:20.087
I just had a weird dream.

11
00:01:22.857 --> 00:01:24.456
What was it?

12
00:01:26.057 --> 00:01:27.426
It's nothing.

13
00:01:27.757 --> 00:01:29.456
Go back to sleep. I'm sorry.

14
00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:33.367
Is it because of me?

15
00:01:33.367 --> 00:01:34.536
Should I go back to my room?

16
00:01:34.536 --> 00:01:36.036
No, stay here.

17
00:01:36.296 --> 00:01:37.307
Go to sleep.

18
00:01:39.706 --> 00:01:40.807
Go back to sleep.

19
00:01:56.417 --> 00:01:57.557
Good morning.

20
00:01:57.557 --> 00:01:58.926
Good morning.

21
00:01:59.926 --> 00:02:01.426
- Aunt Sook Hee. - Yes?

22
00:02:01.626 --> 00:02:03.197
I proposed to Hae Ra.

23
00:02:04.167 --> 00:02:05.426
When?

24
00:02:05.426 --> 00:02:06.626
Last night.

25
00:02:07.096 --> 00:02:08.367
What did she say?

26
00:02:08.536 --> 00:02:09.867
She said yes, right?

27
00:02:11.536 --> 00:02:13.677
Congratulations!

28
00:02:14.606 --> 00:02:16.606
You can still live with us even after we get married.

29
00:02:17.147 --> 00:02:18.976
Am I going to be ill-treated?

30
00:02:18.976 --> 00:02:20.816
Don't worry. That will never happen.

31
00:02:21.147 --> 00:02:23.747
Goodness. Congratulations.

32
00:02:24.047 --> 00:02:25.686
Sit down.

33
00:02:55.846 --> 00:02:59.047
Hae Ra. Congratulations.

34
00:02:59.087 --> 00:03:01.286
I heard he proposed to you last night.

35
00:03:01.987 --> 00:03:03.017
Yes.

36
00:03:13.436 --> 00:03:15.467
Lend me your scarf.

37
00:03:17.936 --> 00:03:19.006
Okay.

38
00:03:34.186 --> 00:03:35.217
Yes?

39
00:03:38.126 --> 00:03:39.457
I'm going to...

40
00:03:39.457 --> 00:03:41.656
marry my first love, Moon Soo Ho.

41
00:03:44.267 --> 00:03:47.367
But I'll start wearing the ring...

42
00:03:48.566 --> 00:03:50.506
after Dr. Moon's case is taken care of.

43
00:03:52.936 --> 00:03:54.277
Was it too rushed?

44
00:03:54.606 --> 00:03:55.837
No.

45
00:03:55.837 --> 00:03:58.647
It felt great to be proposed to.

46
00:04:03.217 --> 00:04:05.686
My dad did you wrong big time.

47
00:04:06.587 --> 00:04:09.457
But my dad wasn't as horrible as...

48
00:04:09.457 --> 00:04:11.126
Chairman Park thinks.

49
00:04:11.527 --> 00:04:12.626
I trust my dad.

50
00:04:13.027 --> 00:04:14.927
I do too. Don't worry.

51
00:04:15.427 --> 00:04:16.697
I'm off to work now.

52
00:04:16.967 --> 00:04:17.996
Hae Ra.

53
00:04:18.527 --> 00:04:21.866
I don't want you to go to Sharon Tailor anymore.

54
00:04:21.866 --> 00:04:23.197
Also, don't meet with her outside.

55
00:04:23.736 --> 00:04:24.767
Why not?

56
00:04:25.106 --> 00:04:28.106
I behaved coldly when I made her leave.

57
00:04:28.806 --> 00:04:30.976
But don't you need her help for work?

58
00:04:31.346 --> 00:04:32.746
No, it's all right.

59
00:04:33.246 --> 00:04:34.877
Haven't you done business before?

60
00:04:34.916 --> 00:04:36.377
You just have to suck it up,

61
00:04:36.377 --> 00:04:38.187
and put up with jerks.

62
00:04:39.286 --> 00:04:40.757
She's in a different level.

63
00:04:41.187 --> 00:04:42.356
I don't want you to see her.

64
00:04:44.187 --> 00:04:47.027
Did something happen that I don't know about?

65
00:04:47.726 --> 00:04:49.156
Just don't see her.

66
00:04:51.096 --> 00:04:52.166
Okay.

67
00:04:53.267 --> 00:04:54.267
Bye.

68
00:05:12.786 --> 00:05:14.486
Whose is this?

69
00:05:14.556 --> 00:05:15.856
It's Hae Ra's aunt's.

70
00:05:16.416 --> 00:05:17.887
She's coming to try it on later.

71
00:05:19.127 --> 00:05:22.627
And men's shirts...

72
00:05:24.096 --> 00:05:25.127
Wait.

73
00:05:25.366 --> 00:05:27.096
Why did you make so many?

74
00:05:38.976 --> 00:05:41.346
Even if the bodies were switched in hospital,

75
00:05:41.947 --> 00:05:44.447
how was my dad's body found in such a place?

76
00:05:45.616 --> 00:05:49.056
It's puzzling to me too.

77
00:05:50.556 --> 00:05:53.457
I think they did it...

78
00:05:54.496 --> 00:05:56.897
to hide the mistake...

79
00:05:57.327 --> 00:06:00.796
made by the hospital employee.

80
00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:07.676
I'm going to prove that my dad...

81
00:06:08.606 --> 00:06:10.546
has nothing to do with the fire,

82
00:06:10.546 --> 00:06:12.346
and that you know...

83
00:06:14.976 --> 00:06:16.647
something about my dad's death.

84
00:06:27.156 --> 00:06:28.926
You'll be late for work.

85
00:06:44.246 --> 00:06:46.916
Signs of speculation appear in Geumseong-dong.

86
00:06:46.916 --> 00:06:48.317
Defeats the purpose of choosing the neighborhood.

87
00:06:48.317 --> 00:06:49.777
Demand for withdrawal on the rise.

88
00:06:49.777 --> 00:06:50.846
Gosh.

89
00:06:50.846 --> 00:06:52.447
That's weird.

90
00:06:52.786 --> 00:06:54.717
There are only unfavorable articles.

91
00:06:54.717 --> 00:06:57.827
Mr. Moon should go down alone.

92
00:06:57.827 --> 00:06:59.257
- Hello. - Hi.

93
00:06:59.856 --> 00:07:02.197
It shouldn't affect our company's stock value.

94
00:07:02.197 --> 00:07:04.267
Please don't say things like that.

95
00:07:04.327 --> 00:07:05.366
What if your words come true?

96
00:07:05.366 --> 00:07:08.197
Listen to me. I think...

97
00:07:08.197 --> 00:07:09.567
Geumseong-dong will be bulldozed out,

98
00:07:09.567 --> 00:07:11.337
and new buildings will be built.

99
00:07:13.207 --> 00:07:14.976
Everything will turn out well.

100
00:07:15.536 --> 00:07:16.676
How do you know?

101
00:07:16.676 --> 00:07:19.007
I always have a good hunch.

102
00:07:19.577 --> 00:07:20.647
See?

103
00:07:20.717 --> 00:07:22.317
Are you going to the public hearing later?

104
00:07:22.517 --> 00:07:25.087
Of course. I'll hear Mr. Moon present.

105
00:07:25.087 --> 00:07:26.317
Public hearing.

106
00:07:29.156 --> 00:07:30.827
There will be a public hearing today?

107
00:07:30.827 --> 00:07:32.587
What's that all about?

108
00:07:32.587 --> 00:07:34.257
- A public hearing? - What?

109
00:07:34.257 --> 00:07:36.197
Except for a few property owners,

110
00:07:36.197 --> 00:07:38.866
redevelopment is better for the residents here.

111
00:07:38.866 --> 00:07:40.137
- Yes. - Of course.

112
00:07:40.137 --> 00:07:42.567
Regardless of revival project,

113
00:07:42.567 --> 00:07:43.707
they've never...

114
00:07:43.707 --> 00:07:45.806
lived in a 40-year-old house here.

115
00:07:45.806 --> 00:07:47.277
They have no right to...

116
00:07:47.277 --> 00:07:49.077
talk about preserving this neighborhood.

117
00:07:49.077 --> 00:07:51.846
Exactly. This makes no sense.

118
00:07:51.846 --> 00:07:52.976
Who do they think they are?

119
00:07:52.976 --> 00:07:54.577
They shouldn't meddle with this area.

120
00:07:54.577 --> 00:07:56.887
- I know. - Exactly.

121
00:07:57.017 --> 00:07:59.116
Most people here wanted redevelopment.

122
00:07:59.717 --> 00:08:01.116
Do you think this makes sense?

123
00:08:01.887 --> 00:08:03.726
- It should be developed. - That's right.

124
00:08:04.986 --> 00:08:06.056
A lot of residents...

125
00:08:06.056 --> 00:08:08.197
have been won over by Chairman Park.

126
00:08:09.496 --> 00:08:11.596
They've been working diligently in secret.

127
00:08:13.937 --> 00:08:15.137
At this public hearing,

128
00:08:15.137 --> 00:08:17.666
we'll hear a lot of opposing arguments.

129
00:08:18.507 --> 00:08:20.577
It's not like we didn't expect that to happen.

130
00:08:21.077 --> 00:08:22.507
Let's do our best to prepare for it.

131
00:08:23.377 --> 00:08:24.377
Yes, sir.

132
00:08:24.377 --> 00:08:25.806
Yes, sir.

133
00:08:28.546 --> 00:08:29.546
Mr. Moon.

134
00:08:29.546 --> 00:08:30.546
Yes?

135
00:08:31.387 --> 00:08:33.687
I got presents for you to cheer you up.

136
00:08:35.157 --> 00:08:36.256
There are two.

137
00:08:42.157 --> 00:08:44.197
They allowed me to take pictures.

138
00:08:44.197 --> 00:08:46.366
You seemed to like this painting.

139
00:08:49.136 --> 00:08:50.437
Thanks, Chan Ki.

140
00:08:50.937 --> 00:08:52.006
You're welcome.

141
00:08:52.337 --> 00:08:54.376
The second present will be ready soon.

142
00:08:55.876 --> 00:08:56.947
What is it?

143
00:08:57.577 --> 00:08:59.907
Remember the strange text you received?

144
00:09:00.177 --> 00:09:02.077
My friend is looking into where the message...

145
00:09:02.077 --> 00:09:04.246
was sent from through an unofficial channel.

146
00:09:04.886 --> 00:09:06.516
Just wait a bit longer.

147
00:09:19.496 --> 00:09:20.596
It's me.

148
00:09:21.797 --> 00:09:23.337
Try to remember.

149
00:09:41.317 --> 00:09:43.356
Yes, this is Jung Hae Ra of General Business Team.

150
00:09:43.827 --> 00:09:45.886
How many red bean breads today?

151
00:09:48.557 --> 00:09:50.167
3,588.

152
00:09:51.167 --> 00:09:52.427
Do you want to have lunch together?

153
00:09:52.667 --> 00:09:54.896
I have to drop by Young Mi's shop.

154
00:09:55.837 --> 00:09:57.736
I'll wait for you. Let's eat lunch together.

155
00:09:57.807 --> 00:09:58.907
Okay.

156
00:10:15.356 --> 00:10:16.827
Is it too big?

157
00:10:17.486 --> 00:10:19.386
I'll lose weight in spring,

158
00:10:19.386 --> 00:10:21.126
so make it tight.

159
00:10:22.526 --> 00:10:24.596
You must be happy that I was kicked out.

160
00:10:25.866 --> 00:10:28.667
I'm sad because I miss your fabulous cooking.

161
00:10:31.967 --> 00:10:34.006
I prepared presents as a way of...

162
00:10:34.006 --> 00:10:35.537
repaying Mr. Moon's kindness.

163
00:10:37.646 --> 00:10:38.846
Please put them...

164
00:10:38.846 --> 00:10:40.447
in his closet without him noticing.

165
00:10:41.577 --> 00:10:43.276
Goodness.

166
00:10:43.276 --> 00:10:45.587
Those are something.

167
00:10:46.687 --> 00:10:48.256
Are Mr. Moon and Hae Ra doing well?

168
00:10:48.657 --> 00:10:51.986
A lot of things happened.

169
00:10:52.327 --> 00:10:53.327
Like?

170
00:10:53.557 --> 00:10:55.896
Well, it'll take a while to tell you everything.

171
00:10:56.327 --> 00:10:57.996
The best thing that happened was...

172
00:10:57.996 --> 00:11:00.596
Mr. Moon...

173
00:11:00.636 --> 00:11:02.896
proposing to Hae Ra.

174
00:11:05.736 --> 00:11:07.606
I knew it.

175
00:11:08.077 --> 00:11:10.177
They look so great together.

176
00:11:13.976 --> 00:11:16.687
Will they get married?

177
00:11:19.246 --> 00:11:20.256
When?

178
00:11:20.756 --> 00:11:23.157
I think within this year.

179
00:11:24.057 --> 00:11:27.327
They're kind of like a married couple already.

180
00:11:28.096 --> 00:11:30.896
They go in and out of each other's room...

181
00:11:30.967 --> 00:11:33.697
- all the time and... - Really?

182
00:11:33.697 --> 00:11:36.297
- And? - They're head over heels.

183
00:11:36.297 --> 00:11:37.337
Tell me more.

184
00:11:37.337 --> 00:11:38.967
Goodness.

185
00:11:40.907 --> 00:11:42.177
What's wrong?

186
00:11:43.476 --> 00:11:44.776
What are you doing...

187
00:11:45.276 --> 00:11:46.547
while doing a fitting?

188
00:11:52.947 --> 00:11:54.957
You're Hae Ra's aunt. What brings you here?

189
00:11:55.356 --> 00:11:56.687
Hello.

190
00:11:56.687 --> 00:11:58.057
She told me she'd make a coat for me,

191
00:11:58.057 --> 00:11:59.427
so I came to be fitted.

192
00:11:59.726 --> 00:12:02.197
She seems to be sick all of a sudden.

193
00:12:04.266 --> 00:12:05.427
What are you doing?

194
00:12:06.467 --> 00:12:08.797
I feel like my heart is suddenly twisted...

195
00:12:10.207 --> 00:12:11.506
and torn apart.

196
00:12:12.037 --> 00:12:13.167
I think it's because...

197
00:12:13.876 --> 00:12:17.307
she heard that Mr. Moon proposed...

198
00:12:17.707 --> 00:12:18.947
to Hae Ra.

199
00:12:19.876 --> 00:12:21.516
I know how you feel.

200
00:12:21.516 --> 00:12:24.817
I hate to receive others' wedding invitations too.

201
00:12:26.756 --> 00:12:29.957
Soo Ho proposed to her?

202
00:12:30.587 --> 00:12:31.657
Yes.

203
00:13:03.957 --> 00:13:05.026
Who...

204
00:13:06.126 --> 00:13:07.957
drew this trash?

205
00:13:08.226 --> 00:13:09.427
In the past,

206
00:13:10.396 --> 00:13:12.626
no one was on your side either.

207
00:13:14.567 --> 00:13:16.266
You think it's too harsh on you?

208
00:13:17.266 --> 00:13:18.807
What did I do wrong?

209
00:13:19.907 --> 00:13:20.907
Right.

210
00:13:22.337 --> 00:13:23.876
You could've been pitied...

211
00:13:24.776 --> 00:13:26.846
for what I have sinned...

212
00:13:27.677 --> 00:13:28.817
until you...

213
00:13:29.817 --> 00:13:32.317
made her into his real wife.

214
00:13:36.356 --> 00:13:38.486
You made Boon Yi wear your clothes.

215
00:13:39.157 --> 00:13:40.927
You framed her as Lee Myung So's wife.

216
00:13:40.927 --> 00:13:42.596
She got taken away as a result.

217
00:13:43.667 --> 00:13:46.126
- You knew she'd die. - I don't want to hear it.

218
00:13:46.126 --> 00:13:48.366
You testified that Lee Myung So was...

219
00:13:48.366 --> 00:13:50.067
a Catholic.

220
00:13:50.667 --> 00:13:51.736
And...

221
00:13:52.636 --> 00:13:55.006
you made them burn to death.

222
00:13:57.246 --> 00:13:58.307
You...

223
00:13:59.006 --> 00:14:00.447
are only...

224
00:14:01.317 --> 00:14:03.246
a lowly and evil witch.

225
00:14:12.187 --> 00:14:13.187
Excuse me.

226
00:14:14.457 --> 00:14:16.396
Your grandfather's grandfather's father...

227
00:14:16.396 --> 00:14:17.697
drew that painting?

228
00:14:18.626 --> 00:14:19.626
Yes.

229
00:14:19.896 --> 00:14:22.337
There must be a portrait that looks like me.

230
00:14:22.967 --> 00:14:24.937
Couldn't you find it anywhere in your house?

231
00:14:30.976 --> 00:14:32.346
Jeom Bok, that little...

232
00:14:36.516 --> 00:14:38.146
I'm sure it'll be a torture for you,

233
00:14:39.016 --> 00:14:41.687
but make a wedding dress for Hae Ra.

234
00:14:45.657 --> 00:14:46.697
No.

235
00:14:46.797 --> 00:14:48.756
You've lived for more than 200 years.

236
00:14:49.297 --> 00:14:52.026
Have you ever held yourself in...

237
00:14:52.626 --> 00:14:54.667
and done something you really didn't want to do?

238
00:14:55.236 --> 00:14:58.636
I couldn't be with someone I love.

239
00:14:59.136 --> 00:15:01.177
That's what you wanted to do but couldn't.

240
00:15:01.476 --> 00:15:03.307
Something you hated like crazy,

241
00:15:03.307 --> 00:15:04.907
but held yourself in to do.

242
00:15:08.116 --> 00:15:09.616
Do it this time.

243
00:15:10.417 --> 00:15:11.417
Then...

244
00:15:11.717 --> 00:15:13.587
your obsession will fade away.

245
00:15:14.287 --> 00:15:16.317
In your 250 years of life,

246
00:15:16.726 --> 00:15:19.486
you have to learn at least one thing.

247
00:15:35.376 --> 00:15:37.506
She made a lot of his clothes.

248
00:15:39.976 --> 00:15:44.346
When will my coat be ready?

249
00:16:00.396 --> 00:16:01.396
Mr. Moon.

250
00:16:01.866 --> 00:16:02.866
Yes?

251
00:16:02.967 --> 00:16:04.907
Your second gift has arrived just now.

252
00:16:05.366 --> 00:16:07.437
They found where the unknown text was sent.

253
00:16:07.937 --> 00:16:08.937
Where?

254
00:16:09.407 --> 00:16:11.376
That's a bit strange.

255
00:16:12.577 --> 00:16:14.776
It's a place which we've never thought of.

256
00:16:14.776 --> 00:16:16.746
It's a clothing store in Cheongdam-dong.

257
00:16:24.256 --> 00:16:26.557
- I don't know. - Maybe they went missing.

258
00:16:27.327 --> 00:16:28.697
No way.

259
00:16:28.697 --> 00:16:29.797
If they didn't,

260
00:16:29.797 --> 00:16:31.797
why don't you know where your parents are?

261
00:16:31.797 --> 00:16:33.266
Because they're traveling.

262
00:16:33.266 --> 00:16:34.766
I talked to them on the phone.

263
00:16:34.766 --> 00:16:37.236
They did check the hospital record then.

264
00:16:37.567 --> 00:16:38.937
What was the name of the hospital?

265
00:16:41.136 --> 00:16:42.276
What's wrong with you?

266
00:16:42.437 --> 00:16:45.077
You're suspicious. Are you hiding something from me?

267
00:16:45.177 --> 00:16:47.646
I'm not hiding anything from you.

268
00:16:47.646 --> 00:16:49.047
Why would I?

269
00:16:49.047 --> 00:16:50.317
Goodness.

270
00:16:52.217 --> 00:16:53.886
Didn't you hear anything from Gon's father?

271
00:16:53.886 --> 00:16:55.457
No.

272
00:16:56.217 --> 00:16:57.486
Come on.

273
00:16:58.856 --> 00:16:59.957
Hello.

274
00:17:02.096 --> 00:17:04.026
I thought we were meeting at a cafe nearby.

275
00:17:04.226 --> 00:17:05.897
I want to buy you some clothes here...

276
00:17:06.066 --> 00:17:07.397
and raise Young Mi's sales too.

277
00:17:07.796 --> 00:17:10.336
What's the most expensive and finest clothes here?

278
00:17:10.667 --> 00:17:13.036
All our clothes are fine.

279
00:17:14.377 --> 00:17:16.437
Is this size 44 or 33?

280
00:17:16.437 --> 00:17:17.607
Goodness.

281
00:17:17.607 --> 00:17:19.607
There isn't size 33.

282
00:17:19.607 --> 00:17:21.476
And all the clothes here were imported from abroad.

283
00:17:21.476 --> 00:17:23.516
Their sizes are written in a foreign way.

284
00:17:23.516 --> 00:17:24.516
Is that right?

285
00:17:27.357 --> 00:17:28.486
This one's pretty.

286
00:17:28.717 --> 00:17:30.726
Hae Ra, try this on.

287
00:17:30.986 --> 00:17:32.927
Forget it. Let's just go have lunch.

288
00:17:32.927 --> 00:17:34.457
Try this on first.

289
00:17:43.236 --> 00:17:45.207
Goodness.

290
00:17:45.367 --> 00:17:47.377
I'm so jealous that I'm annoyed.

291
00:17:47.976 --> 00:17:48.976
Young Mi.

292
00:17:49.437 --> 00:17:50.447
Yes?

293
00:17:50.447 --> 00:17:52.276
Why did you send me that text?

294
00:17:54.377 --> 00:17:55.377
Pardon?

295
00:17:56.476 --> 00:17:58.217
How did you restrict your number?

296
00:17:59.246 --> 00:18:01.117
I don't know what you're talking about.

297
00:18:01.117 --> 00:18:02.816
Didn't you send me a text?

298
00:18:03.586 --> 00:18:05.887
I did send you a text...

299
00:18:05.887 --> 00:18:07.726
to thank you for inviting me for dinner last time.

300
00:18:08.826 --> 00:18:11.627
Then I'll submit the text to the police too.

301
00:18:13.026 --> 00:18:15.397
"I was a researcher who used to work at the lab."

302
00:18:15.867 --> 00:18:18.566
"Dr. Moon was killed by his friend, Mr. Jung."

303
00:18:20.336 --> 00:18:21.677
I'm sorry.

304
00:18:23.776 --> 00:18:26.447
I thought you were suspecting Gon's father.

305
00:18:26.746 --> 00:18:28.617
It was an impulsive act and a mistake.

306
00:18:33.887 --> 00:18:34.917
Young Mi.

307
00:18:35.486 --> 00:18:37.786
- Yes? - I feel bad.

308
00:18:38.486 --> 00:18:39.756
Hae Ra doesn't have a friend...

309
00:18:39.756 --> 00:18:41.256
because she struggled so much to survive in life.

310
00:18:41.256 --> 00:18:43.467
You seem to be her only best friend.

311
00:18:49.236 --> 00:18:50.236
Well?

312
00:18:50.236 --> 00:18:52.707
It's too big for me. I look like a fool in this.

313
00:18:54.107 --> 00:18:55.607
- Give it to me. - I'm sorry, Hae Ra.

314
00:18:55.607 --> 00:18:57.877
I'll get some clothes that fit your size.

315
00:18:57.877 --> 00:18:58.976
You want to join us for lunch?

316
00:18:58.976 --> 00:18:59.976
No.

317
00:19:00.576 --> 00:19:02.476
I have a reservation to attend to.

318
00:19:02.847 --> 00:19:04.347
- I'll see you later. - Bye.

319
00:19:05.217 --> 00:19:06.347
Let's go. Bye.

320
00:19:17.326 --> 00:19:18.397
Here.

321
00:19:26.036 --> 00:19:27.937
What did you talk about with her?

322
00:19:28.437 --> 00:19:30.576
Well, nothing special.

323
00:19:30.576 --> 00:19:32.476
She looked awful.

324
00:19:34.947 --> 00:19:36.447
- Hae Ra. - Yes?

325
00:19:37.187 --> 00:19:38.746
You've got me. Don't worry.

326
00:19:46.897 --> 00:19:48.657
I want to go somewhere with you after this.

327
00:19:48.826 --> 00:19:50.867
You always take me to places.

328
00:20:28.437 --> 00:20:29.437
Gosh.

329
00:20:34.437 --> 00:20:35.776
Isn't this too much?

330
00:20:35.776 --> 00:20:37.476
We still have so much time left for our wedding.

331
00:20:37.847 --> 00:20:39.806
I wanted to see you in a wedding dress.

332
00:20:41.316 --> 00:20:43.917
I wanted to see me in a wedding dress too.

333
00:20:45.016 --> 00:20:46.086
What do you think?

334
00:20:47.056 --> 00:20:48.187
It's so pretty.

335
00:20:49.816 --> 00:20:51.857
You're the prettiest in the world.

336
00:20:52.986 --> 00:20:56.457
I wanted to get my dress done at Sharon Tailor.

337
00:20:56.697 --> 00:20:59.097
Forget it. Look here.

338
00:21:05.336 --> 00:21:06.907
(Mr. Han)

339
00:21:07.107 --> 00:21:08.937
Hold on. I'm getting a call. Sorry.

340
00:21:09.707 --> 00:21:10.806
Yes, Mr. Han.

341
00:21:10.976 --> 00:21:12.806
Are you far away from the office, sir?

342
00:21:22.516 --> 00:21:23.586
It's true...

343
00:21:23.586 --> 00:21:26.187
Dr. Moon got in trouble because of Mr. Jung.

344
00:21:26.627 --> 00:21:30.026
Still, he was going to let it slide.

345
00:21:30.026 --> 00:21:32.796
Then Mr. Jung didn't give up on his greed.

346
00:21:33.967 --> 00:21:35.566
What greed?

347
00:21:35.836 --> 00:21:38.367
He wanted to take Dr. Moon's research...

348
00:21:38.937 --> 00:21:40.576
to use for his business.

349
00:21:41.177 --> 00:21:42.707
How did you know that?

350
00:21:42.707 --> 00:21:44.847
We worked on the same project.

351
00:21:45.246 --> 00:21:47.647
On the night of the fire,

352
00:21:47.647 --> 00:21:49.046
he came to the lab very late,

353
00:21:49.046 --> 00:21:50.717
and they had a huge fight.

354
00:21:52.286 --> 00:21:53.986
I saw someone...

355
00:21:53.986 --> 00:21:55.457
on the night of the fire.

356
00:21:55.756 --> 00:21:58.256
I saw him in Hae Ra's old family picture.

357
00:21:58.427 --> 00:22:00.397
He walked in looking angry.

358
00:22:00.627 --> 00:22:02.526
Short circuit, my foot.

359
00:22:02.526 --> 00:22:03.927
I think...

360
00:22:03.927 --> 00:22:05.967
the fire broke out because of their fight.

361
00:22:06.427 --> 00:22:08.197
Why didn't you stop them from fighting?

362
00:22:08.597 --> 00:22:11.336
How can I stop them?

363
00:22:13.806 --> 00:22:17.207
Sir, we just got a call from the parking lot.

364
00:22:17.207 --> 00:22:20.316
If it's all right, may I move it for you?

365
00:22:26.447 --> 00:22:27.556
So...

366
00:22:27.957 --> 00:22:29.457
do you believe...

367
00:22:29.457 --> 00:22:31.586
that happened during their fight?

368
00:22:31.586 --> 00:22:33.157
I believe that is...

369
00:22:33.457 --> 00:22:34.927
highly possible.

370
00:22:34.927 --> 00:22:36.726
Why didn't you tell the police back then?

371
00:22:36.726 --> 00:22:37.996
I didn't want to...

372
00:22:37.996 --> 00:22:39.967
step in to complicate things.

373
00:22:40.397 --> 00:22:41.937
I was personally...

374
00:22:41.937 --> 00:22:43.637
having a tough time as well.

375
00:22:48.377 --> 00:22:49.607
Are you sure it was Mr. Jung?

376
00:22:49.607 --> 00:22:50.647
Of course.

377
00:22:50.647 --> 00:22:52.476
We drank together often...

378
00:22:52.476 --> 00:22:54.516
and we used to go hiking. I know him very well.

379
00:22:54.576 --> 00:22:55.877
I'm completely sure.

380
00:23:12.627 --> 00:23:13.667
Did you find it?

381
00:23:14.667 --> 00:23:16.707
- Pardon? - My wedding anniversary.

382
00:23:16.707 --> 00:23:18.967
I asked you to find a restaurant for dinner.

383
00:23:19.107 --> 00:23:20.207
Sir.

384
00:23:22.976 --> 00:23:25.177
You must keep your private matters to yourself.

385
00:23:25.177 --> 00:23:26.776
This is a part of work.

386
00:23:26.776 --> 00:23:27.947
An employee of a travel agency...

387
00:23:27.947 --> 00:23:29.647
ought to know these places. Isn't that right?

388
00:23:30.816 --> 00:23:31.947
I found a few.

389
00:23:31.947 --> 00:23:32.986
Good.

390
00:23:33.617 --> 00:23:34.986
(A night out at Cheongdam-dong)

391
00:23:38.556 --> 00:23:41.226
I knew it. Ju Hee is bad at work.

392
00:23:43.127 --> 00:23:44.766
Do you have anything classier than these?

393
00:23:45.667 --> 00:23:46.937
I'll look for more.

394
00:23:46.937 --> 00:23:48.336
Thank you.

395
00:23:51.607 --> 00:23:53.637
Why is he asking us to find a place...

396
00:23:53.637 --> 00:23:55.476
for his wedding anniversary dinner?

397
00:23:55.476 --> 00:23:57.877
At least he's not asking us to go try it out.

398
00:23:58.746 --> 00:23:59.976
You know what?

399
00:24:00.276 --> 00:24:01.877
I can't trust these bloggers.

400
00:24:01.877 --> 00:24:03.947
When you find a classy restaurant,

401
00:24:03.947 --> 00:24:05.187
go and try it out.

402
00:24:05.417 --> 00:24:06.657
Do we get the corporate card?

403
00:24:06.657 --> 00:24:08.516
This is a part of work.

404
00:24:08.556 --> 00:24:09.556
Why?

405
00:24:09.556 --> 00:24:11.056
It's you two that are eating there.

406
00:24:11.326 --> 00:24:13.256
Let's get to the meeting.

407
00:24:13.457 --> 00:24:15.296
Ju Hee, take this.

408
00:24:19.597 --> 00:24:21.566
- See you. - Did you see that?

409
00:24:25.667 --> 00:24:27.576
Short circuit, my foot.

410
00:24:27.576 --> 00:24:28.976
I think...

411
00:24:28.976 --> 00:24:31.076
the fire broke out because of their fight.

412
00:24:47.026 --> 00:24:48.056
Mr. Moon.

413
00:24:48.056 --> 00:24:49.657
We'll go first to get ready.

414
00:24:51.726 --> 00:24:52.867
Let's go together.

415
00:24:57.967 --> 00:24:59.867
(Geumseong-dong Redevelopment Hearing)

416
00:25:04.177 --> 00:25:05.847
Let's preserve the town.

417
00:25:06.377 --> 00:25:07.917
Please take a look.

418
00:25:08.316 --> 00:25:11.086
- Go, redevelopment! - Please read this.

419
00:25:11.187 --> 00:25:13.217
Let's get redeveloped!

420
00:25:14.016 --> 00:25:16.957
- Please read this. - Say no to redevelopment.

421
00:25:18.486 --> 00:25:20.427
- Go, redevelopment! - Say no.

422
00:25:20.427 --> 00:25:22.857
Redevelopment isn't always good.

423
00:25:22.857 --> 00:25:25.226
We must preserve the history of this town.

424
00:25:29.066 --> 00:25:30.937
(We're all for the redevelopment!)

425
00:25:33.976 --> 00:25:35.907
Let's do the redevelopment!

426
00:25:36.476 --> 00:25:38.576
- Go, redevelopment! - Let's do this.

427
00:25:39.207 --> 00:25:40.617
It doesn't matter if it becomes...

428
00:25:41.076 --> 00:25:42.447
a place for speculation or redevelopment,

429
00:25:43.516 --> 00:25:44.687
you cannot stop...

430
00:25:45.217 --> 00:25:47.417
a town from changing over time.

431
00:25:49.187 --> 00:25:51.326
Instead of letting the speculators get money,

432
00:25:51.857 --> 00:25:53.526
it's better to receive some compensation...

433
00:25:53.526 --> 00:25:56.457
to accept new buildings and new infrastructures.

434
00:25:58.967 --> 00:26:00.296
- That's true. - You're right.

435
00:26:00.296 --> 00:26:02.597
- You're very much right. - He's right.

436
00:26:03.566 --> 00:26:05.736
We can become the fanciest town...

437
00:26:06.637 --> 00:26:08.276
within the four gates of old Seoul.

438
00:26:08.276 --> 00:26:10.147
- All right! - Sounds great.

439
00:26:24.387 --> 00:26:26.697
Without the power that fuels the speculation,

440
00:26:27.226 --> 00:26:28.427
it is possible to receive...

441
00:26:28.427 --> 00:26:30.066
government funding to preserve this town.

442
00:26:31.026 --> 00:26:33.097
Why must we get rid of this beautiful town...

443
00:26:33.437 --> 00:26:35.437
filled with houses that are over 100 years old?

444
00:26:35.796 --> 00:26:37.006
You're right!

445
00:26:37.006 --> 00:26:38.967
- That's not realistic. - All right!

446
00:26:43.976 --> 00:26:45.847
What the townspeople need is...

447
00:26:46.917 --> 00:26:49.046
not preserving and fixing these old houses.

448
00:26:49.347 --> 00:26:51.117
What they need is new infrastructure.

449
00:26:51.786 --> 00:26:52.917
Why do you think a building with...

450
00:26:52.917 --> 00:26:55.457
a large parking lot and a food court is bad?

451
00:26:56.316 --> 00:26:58.786
- Right. - We want that too.

452
00:26:58.786 --> 00:27:00.726
- Exactly. - We'd like that.

453
00:27:00.726 --> 00:27:01.957
- You're right! - Yes.

454
00:27:01.957 --> 00:27:04.427
- You're right. - We agree.

455
00:27:05.897 --> 00:27:08.137
Do you want your town to be just another one...

456
00:27:08.137 --> 00:27:10.407
that's filled with the same apartments?

457
00:27:10.937 --> 00:27:12.137
We love it.

458
00:27:12.137 --> 00:27:14.006
Everyone lives in a modern home now.

459
00:27:14.006 --> 00:27:16.407
Why do we have to live in old houses?

460
00:27:16.407 --> 00:27:17.647
- Right. - You also live...

461
00:27:17.647 --> 00:27:20.516
in a huge modern mansion.

462
00:27:20.516 --> 00:27:21.677
You can try to...

463
00:27:21.677 --> 00:27:23.687
make that argument if you live here.

464
00:27:23.687 --> 00:27:25.187
- Yes. - Try living here.

465
00:27:25.187 --> 00:27:26.486
- He doesn't know. - He has no idea.

466
00:27:26.486 --> 00:27:27.556
Mr. Moon.

467
00:27:29.586 --> 00:27:31.286
Why did you choose this town of all places?

468
00:27:34.796 --> 00:27:36.256
It's because this town has...

469
00:27:36.726 --> 00:27:38.167
that antiquity which isn't easily found...

470
00:27:38.167 --> 00:27:40.066
within the four gates of the old Seoul.

471
00:27:41.467 --> 00:27:42.937
If this town gets preserved,

472
00:27:43.407 --> 00:27:45.766
its value would be incalculable.

473
00:27:48.036 --> 00:27:49.476
Isn't it because of a woman?

474
00:27:53.677 --> 00:27:54.776
A woman?

475
00:27:59.617 --> 00:28:01.887
A successful businessman who lives in the US...

476
00:28:01.887 --> 00:28:03.357
returns to Korea,

477
00:28:04.226 --> 00:28:06.826
then preserves a town that has the memories...

478
00:28:07.026 --> 00:28:08.756
of his first love.

479
00:28:13.066 --> 00:28:14.937
Doesn't that sound like a plot from a movie?

480
00:28:20.407 --> 00:28:21.736
Is that true?

481
00:28:21.736 --> 00:28:24.076
If it is, he must be insane, right?

482
00:28:24.076 --> 00:28:26.506
- He is. - That's crazy.

483
00:28:29.617 --> 00:28:31.717
He's a man of all men. A real man.

484
00:28:32.746 --> 00:28:34.286
Does he think this is a drama?

485
00:28:35.357 --> 00:28:37.086
As a fellow man,

486
00:28:37.586 --> 00:28:38.786
I have respect...

487
00:28:39.486 --> 00:28:40.597
for such love.

488
00:28:42.296 --> 00:28:43.397
However,

489
00:28:43.897 --> 00:28:46.367
the inconvenience of the townspeople are...

490
00:28:46.597 --> 00:28:48.367
far too great to help you...

491
00:28:48.697 --> 00:28:50.967
boast about your love through the preservation.

492
00:28:53.736 --> 00:28:54.806
Why did the town...

493
00:28:56.006 --> 00:28:58.347
of your memory have to be this place?

494
00:29:00.677 --> 00:29:03.177
I'd like to express my regret about that.

495
00:29:05.917 --> 00:29:07.256
That's unbelievable.

496
00:29:07.387 --> 00:29:09.857
Are you spending that much money on a woman?

497
00:29:09.857 --> 00:29:11.726
You're a lunatic.

498
00:29:11.927 --> 00:29:14.957
Is this true? Is it because of a woman?

499
00:29:17.967 --> 00:29:19.627
- Unbelievable. - Goodness.

500
00:29:21.266 --> 00:29:23.937
Please give them an answer,

501
00:29:25.006 --> 00:29:26.207
Mr. Moon.

502
00:29:31.207 --> 00:29:33.917
I won't deny that. That's partially true.

503
00:29:35.717 --> 00:29:37.286
Did he just say yes?

504
00:29:37.286 --> 00:29:38.986
- He's crazy. - Completely insane.

505
00:29:40.016 --> 00:29:42.486
My goodness. He's insane.

506
00:29:42.486 --> 00:29:45.056
Yes, it's a town that has memories of my first love.

507
00:29:46.256 --> 00:29:49.127
But this town is also beautiful and valuable.

508
00:29:49.256 --> 00:29:50.526
If you want to spend your money,

509
00:29:50.526 --> 00:29:52.726
go throw them down Han River.

510
00:29:52.726 --> 00:29:53.967
Why are you...

511
00:29:53.967 --> 00:29:56.467
trying to make a joke out of my town?

512
00:29:58.707 --> 00:30:00.937
Back off. Resign!

513
00:30:00.937 --> 00:30:03.306
- Resign! - Resign!

514
00:30:03.306 --> 00:30:04.746
- Resign! - Resign!

515
00:30:04.746 --> 00:30:07.377
- Back off! - Resign!

516
00:30:07.377 --> 00:30:08.717
Get it? Just go.

517
00:30:08.717 --> 00:30:10.347
Wait, one second.

518
00:30:10.647 --> 00:30:12.516
Who is this woman?

519
00:30:13.957 --> 00:30:15.957
Is she here?

520
00:30:15.957 --> 00:30:17.457
Who is it? Raise your hand.

521
00:30:17.457 --> 00:30:19.427
I'll pluck out all of your hair.

522
00:30:19.427 --> 00:30:20.957
- Who is it? - Is she here?

523
00:30:22.756 --> 00:30:24.796
- Let's see her. - Is she here?

524
00:30:25.226 --> 00:30:27.736
- Where are you? - Let's see who you are.

525
00:30:29.097 --> 00:30:30.667
Please calm down.

526
00:30:33.137 --> 00:30:34.236
Today was...

527
00:30:34.506 --> 00:30:37.076
a day to hear out both sides' arguments.

528
00:30:37.776 --> 00:30:39.707
We can put our efforts together...

529
00:30:40.776 --> 00:30:43.347
to stop this town from getting selected...

530
00:30:46.147 --> 00:30:47.687
as a trial for the City Revival Project.

531
00:30:47.887 --> 00:30:50.056
- That's great. - You're right.

532
00:30:50.486 --> 00:30:52.427
- Let's stop this. - Yes.

533
00:30:58.996 --> 00:31:00.897
We must protect our town.

534
00:31:00.897 --> 00:31:03.407
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

535
00:31:08.276 --> 00:31:09.476
Hello.

536
00:31:10.377 --> 00:31:11.576
I am an employee at a travel agency...

537
00:31:11.576 --> 00:31:13.316
working together with Mr. Moon...

538
00:31:13.316 --> 00:31:14.617
on Seoul Neighborhood Revival Project.

539
00:31:15.546 --> 00:31:17.187
Please let me share a word.

540
00:31:19.786 --> 00:31:21.917
Since I work at a travel agency,

541
00:31:21.917 --> 00:31:23.457
I know of many great places...

542
00:31:23.457 --> 00:31:24.687
around this world,

543
00:31:24.687 --> 00:31:26.826
although I have not been to every single one.

544
00:31:27.457 --> 00:31:30.167
Those places that you all dream of visiting.

545
00:31:31.597 --> 00:31:33.127
I believed that this town...

546
00:31:33.127 --> 00:31:35.437
would become like one of those places.

547
00:31:37.707 --> 00:31:39.736
Somewhere my grandmother's place could be.

548
00:31:40.107 --> 00:31:42.637
And a place that doesn't change over time...

549
00:31:42.637 --> 00:31:45.506
and comforts you when you're down.

550
00:31:46.776 --> 00:31:49.986
Why do you seek romance in my neighborhood?

551
00:31:49.986 --> 00:31:52.486
- She's right. - Exactly.

552
00:31:53.957 --> 00:31:56.486
Then I'll tell you something realistic.

553
00:31:58.127 --> 00:31:59.526
The development recompense won't be enough...

554
00:31:59.526 --> 00:32:00.996
to buy a new building.

555
00:32:00.996 --> 00:32:02.526
So you'll need to take out a loan.

556
00:32:02.526 --> 00:32:03.927
- A loan? - Take out a loan?

557
00:32:03.927 --> 00:32:05.796
- A loan? - What loan?

558
00:32:05.796 --> 00:32:07.597
- A loan? - Take out a loan?

559
00:32:07.597 --> 00:32:09.397
Do you know much about...

560
00:32:09.897 --> 00:32:10.937
the loan regulation policy?

561
00:32:10.937 --> 00:32:14.276
- What? - What regulation policy?

562
00:32:14.276 --> 00:32:16.607
I've had a loan problem for 30 years.

563
00:32:16.907 --> 00:32:18.476
It's a reality.

564
00:32:19.076 --> 00:32:20.246
She's right.

565
00:32:20.246 --> 00:32:22.076
They showed you a rose-colored picture,

566
00:32:22.076 --> 00:32:24.516
but never told you about realistic problems.

567
00:32:24.516 --> 00:32:27.086
- I never heard that. - What's going on?

568
00:32:27.086 --> 00:32:28.187
I should think about this.

569
00:32:28.187 --> 00:32:29.786
What does she mean?

570
00:32:29.786 --> 00:32:32.687
Have you heard about that? I haven't.

571
00:32:32.687 --> 00:32:35.157
You may lose history and tradition,

572
00:32:35.157 --> 00:32:37.667
and gain a massive amount of loan.

573
00:32:37.667 --> 00:32:40.667
What are you talking about?

574
00:32:40.667 --> 00:32:43.097
The disappearance of this persimmon tree town...

575
00:32:43.097 --> 00:32:45.566
is a huge loss for this country.

576
00:32:46.207 --> 00:32:47.707
So please reconsider.

577
00:32:48.036 --> 00:32:49.036
Thank you.

578
00:32:49.276 --> 00:32:50.276
Well...

579
00:32:58.046 --> 00:33:00.056
Goodness.

580
00:33:00.857 --> 00:33:02.286
Where are you going?

581
00:33:02.286 --> 00:33:04.157
- Sir. - Where are you going?

582
00:33:04.157 --> 00:33:05.887
You should stay seated until the end.

583
00:33:05.887 --> 00:33:07.996
- Come on. - Gosh.

584
00:33:07.996 --> 00:33:09.427
Come here.

585
00:33:09.427 --> 00:33:11.097
- Let's go. - Don't leave.

586
00:33:11.097 --> 00:33:13.336
- Wait. - Let's think about this.

587
00:33:13.336 --> 00:33:15.467
What are you doing?

588
00:33:15.467 --> 00:33:18.506
Why didn't you tell us?

589
00:33:24.046 --> 00:33:25.907
I need to think about this.

590
00:33:25.907 --> 00:33:27.877
Think about it. We'll talk later.

591
00:33:27.877 --> 00:33:29.476
Goodbye.

592
00:33:29.476 --> 00:33:31.187
It's cold.

593
00:33:34.486 --> 00:33:36.286
Why did you have to say it like that?

594
00:33:37.127 --> 00:33:38.326
What I said was true.

595
00:33:40.397 --> 00:33:41.597
You used to curse your dad,

596
00:33:41.597 --> 00:33:43.097
but you're becoming like him.

597
00:33:50.506 --> 00:33:53.266
If you insult Soo Ho in front of people again,

598
00:33:53.266 --> 00:33:54.736
I won't stand it.

599
00:33:58.306 --> 00:33:59.347
Soo Ho.

600
00:34:00.816 --> 00:34:01.947
I'm jealous of him.

The hearing is over.

603
00:34:11.486 --> 00:34:12.856
Why do you keep fighting?

604
00:34:16.356 --> 00:34:17.626
What are you doing here?

605
00:34:18.626 --> 00:34:19.727
The neighborhood needs to be developed...

606
00:34:19.727 --> 00:34:21.137
so I can get rich.

607
00:34:22.597 --> 00:34:24.307
Come to my shop tomorrow.

608
00:34:24.606 --> 00:34:25.936
I have something to say.

609
00:34:26.407 --> 00:34:27.506
Say it now.

610
00:34:27.736 --> 00:34:28.977
I can't.

(Geumseong-dong Redevelopment Hearing)

613
00:34:57.767 --> 00:35:00.307
Gosh, they should save paper.

614
00:35:00.307 --> 00:35:01.706
What are they doing?

615
00:35:01.706 --> 00:35:03.947
Get in. I'll take them off for you.

616
00:35:05.247 --> 00:35:07.977
At work, we always have to print double-sided.

617
00:35:08.177 --> 00:35:09.646
These are waste of good papers.

618
00:35:11.686 --> 00:35:12.887
I'm sorry, Hae Ra.

619
00:35:14.986 --> 00:35:15.986
What for?

620
00:35:20.927 --> 00:35:22.327
I expected worse.

621
00:35:24.227 --> 00:35:25.796
They're nice people.

622
00:35:25.997 --> 00:35:27.967
What would you have done if they threw bricks?

623
00:35:33.037 --> 00:35:34.436
Never mind them.

624
00:35:34.606 --> 00:35:36.236
We expected this to happen,

625
00:35:36.336 --> 00:35:37.347
right?

626
00:35:40.876 --> 00:35:42.347
Don't mind them.

627
00:35:51.727 --> 00:35:53.396
Soo Ho. What was that?

628
00:35:54.557 --> 00:35:56.327
- Are you okay? - Get in.

629
00:35:56.796 --> 00:35:57.796
Get in.

630
00:36:22.287 --> 00:36:24.756
You'll get hurt if you're with her.

631
00:36:25.927 --> 00:36:27.097
Don't you remember?

632
00:36:33.796 --> 00:36:35.566
The bleeding stopped.

633
00:36:36.336 --> 00:36:38.467
But don't you need to take some painkillers?

634
00:36:39.037 --> 00:36:40.907
It's okay because you treated it well.

635
00:36:42.276 --> 00:36:43.276
Sleep tight.

636
00:36:50.046 --> 00:36:51.247
- Hae Ra. - Yes?

637
00:36:53.416 --> 00:36:54.856
You were awesome today.

638
00:36:55.117 --> 00:36:56.756
And you were the prettiest.

639
00:36:59.186 --> 00:37:00.997
Do you want me to hold your hand?

640
00:37:00.997 --> 00:37:01.997
Yes.

641
00:37:03.427 --> 00:37:04.427
All right.

642
00:37:22.517 --> 00:37:24.517
You should've said no.

643
00:37:25.887 --> 00:37:28.017
That it wasn't because of your first love.

644
00:37:29.756 --> 00:37:31.126
Why didn't you say that?

645
00:37:31.986 --> 00:37:33.456
Why do you think?

646
00:37:37.767 --> 00:37:39.097
I won't say it.

647
00:37:39.727 --> 00:37:41.497
Okay. Just keep it to yourself.

648
00:37:44.566 --> 00:37:46.537
I got the pictures from that day.

649
00:37:47.477 --> 00:37:48.506
There.

650
00:37:56.447 --> 00:37:57.447
What do you think?

651
00:37:57.816 --> 00:37:58.986
You're pretty.

652
00:37:59.816 --> 00:38:01.986
I should print one out and put it on my desk.

653
00:38:02.356 --> 00:38:03.927
Go to sleep now.

654
00:38:06.626 --> 00:38:08.157
I need to lie down.

655
00:38:55.677 --> 00:38:58.146
You'll get hurt if you're with her.

656
00:39:00.477 --> 00:39:01.776
Don't you remember?

657
00:39:33.947 --> 00:39:35.177
You're not asleep yet?

658
00:40:03.236 --> 00:40:04.307
What's wrong?

659
00:40:08.217 --> 00:40:09.217
Goodness.

660
00:40:09.717 --> 00:40:11.316
You're bleeding again.

661
00:40:11.887 --> 00:40:12.986
Should we go to the ER?

662
00:40:12.986 --> 00:40:14.416
No, it's okay.

663
00:40:15.456 --> 00:40:17.227
Let me get the first aid kit.

664
00:40:27.796 --> 00:40:29.736

667
00:40:48.057 --> 00:40:49.256
Are you okay?

668
00:40:50.927 --> 00:40:52.727
Yes, I am.

669
00:40:56.796 --> 00:40:57.927
Yes.

670
00:42:00.997 --> 00:42:02.927
Hello, this is Blacksmith's.

00:42:06.097 --> 00:42:08.467
He hasn't come to the office yet.

Hello?

00:42:39.026 --> 00:42:41.367
Help me. Help me!

677
00:42:41.367 --> 00:42:43.767
Are you okay? What happened?

678
00:42:44.606 --> 00:42:45.736
Goodness.

679
00:42:45.736 --> 00:42:47.276
Is he injured?

680
00:42:57.186 --> 00:42:58.646
Thank goodness he's fine.

681
00:42:58.646 --> 00:43:00.287
I'll talk to Mr. Yoon.

682
00:43:02.186 --> 00:43:03.486
Good morning.

683
00:43:03.486 --> 00:43:04.586
Good morning.

684
00:43:05.126 --> 00:43:06.157
How's your head?

685
00:43:06.157 --> 00:43:07.997
I'm all better. I'm okay.

686
00:43:08.396 --> 00:43:09.497
That's good to hear.

687
00:43:10.927 --> 00:43:12.227
- Hae Ra. - Yes?

688
00:43:13.296 --> 00:43:15.267
Do you remember this man by any chance?

689
00:43:19.606 --> 00:43:21.736
I don't know. Who is he?

690
00:43:22.677 --> 00:43:24.506
He's a researcher who used to work with my father.

691
00:43:26.006 --> 00:43:27.546
How did you know that?

692
00:43:28.617 --> 00:43:30.146
He said he was close with him.

693
00:43:30.146 --> 00:43:32.287
They went hiking together too. Just asking.

694
00:43:32.717 --> 00:43:34.387
What did he say to you?

695
00:43:36.256 --> 00:43:37.727
Nothing much.

696
00:43:37.856 --> 00:43:39.657
He said he was reminded of the past.

697
00:43:41.526 --> 00:43:43.026
I don't remember him at all.

698
00:43:43.157 --> 00:43:44.327
What's his name?

699
00:43:44.497 --> 00:43:46.166
Dr. Do Shin Jae.

700
00:43:48.166 --> 00:43:49.736
Dr. Do Shin Jae?

701
00:43:54.336 --> 00:43:55.407
Have a seat.

702
00:43:55.506 --> 00:43:56.537
Okay.

703
00:43:57.077 --> 00:43:59.247
Here.

704
00:44:04.117 --> 00:44:05.186
Mr. Moon.

705
00:44:07.256 --> 00:44:08.887
It took us some time to find it.

706
00:44:14.896 --> 00:44:17.827
If it's all right, may I move it for you?

707
00:44:26.307 --> 00:44:27.477
(Reading)

708
00:44:37.646 --> 00:44:39.686
He did meet Chairman Park.

709
00:44:43.887 --> 00:44:46.227
We're not sure what they talked about though.

710
00:44:53.066 --> 00:44:54.267
Do Shin Jae.

711
00:44:55.566 --> 00:44:57.006
Dr. Do Shin Jae.

712
00:44:59.606 --> 00:45:01.736
I think I've heard of that name somewhere.

713
00:45:02.537 --> 00:45:04.376
Maybe it's because of his name,

714
00:45:04.376 --> 00:45:06.206
but he's crazy in gambling.

715
00:45:07.376 --> 00:45:09.217
He came to me today...

716
00:45:09.217 --> 00:45:10.646
and asked me to lend him some money,

717
00:45:10.686 --> 00:45:11.916
saying he'd get me...

718
00:45:11.916 --> 00:45:13.686
Dr. Moon's research data in secret.

719
00:45:13.686 --> 00:45:14.887
Goodness.

720
00:45:15.316 --> 00:45:17.827
Gosh, he's strange.

721
00:45:17.827 --> 00:45:19.256
He's really a gambler.

722
00:45:19.256 --> 00:45:21.197
Dr. Do Shin Jae, the gambler.

723
00:45:27.436 --> 00:45:28.697
Hi, Hae Ra.

724
00:45:28.697 --> 00:45:31.736
I remembered who he is.

725
00:45:32.307 --> 00:45:33.736
He's a gambler.

726
00:45:33.936 --> 00:45:34.936
I heard he got fired...

727
00:45:34.936 --> 00:45:36.706
from the lab for gambling.

728
00:45:36.807 --> 00:45:38.546
He used the lab fund too.

729
00:45:45.517 --> 00:45:46.717
"House".

730
00:45:47.686 --> 00:45:51.657
I heard you pay a visit to the house frequently.

731
00:45:53.126 --> 00:45:55.057
Do Shin Jae is a gambler,

732
00:45:55.057 --> 00:45:57.227
and he was bribed by Park Chul Min.

733
00:45:57.626 --> 00:45:58.867
They fabricated the witness.

734
00:45:58.867 --> 00:46:00.197
It's more advantageous to us now.

735
00:46:00.197 --> 00:46:01.736
Please look for more evidence on this.

736
00:46:01.997 --> 00:46:04.267
Okay, I'll check which gambling house he goes to.

737
00:46:04.907 --> 00:46:06.206
Good job, Chan Ki.

738
00:46:17.117 --> 00:46:18.387
Hello, this is Jung Hae Ra...

739
00:46:18.387 --> 00:46:19.486
from General Business Department.

740
00:46:19.787 --> 00:46:21.186
Stop by my shop today.

741
00:46:21.186 --> 00:46:22.956
Don't you have anything more luxurious?

742
00:46:24.256 --> 00:46:25.986
Where did you get this cheap fabric?

743
00:46:25.986 --> 00:46:27.327
I have something to tell you.

744
00:46:27.497 --> 00:46:28.927
You'll regret if you don't come.

745
00:46:28.927 --> 00:46:31.166
This is being recorded according to our rules.

746
00:46:31.166 --> 00:46:33.166
I'll keep calling you to the office if you don't.

747
00:46:33.697 --> 00:46:34.867
I'll see you later.

748
00:46:38.467 --> 00:46:41.177
Use a higher-quality fabric for the dress.

749
00:46:41.477 --> 00:46:42.936
This is unacceptable.

750
00:46:43.546 --> 00:46:44.706
I didn't say I wouldn't.

751
00:46:44.977 --> 00:46:46.106
Okay.

752
00:46:47.017 --> 00:46:49.577
When will you finish making my clothes?

753
00:46:50.086 --> 00:46:51.546
Everything including your spring coat, slacks,

754
00:46:51.546 --> 00:46:53.756
long dress, and mini skirt will be done in two weeks.

755
00:46:54.387 --> 00:46:55.416
Go now.

756
00:46:55.416 --> 00:46:56.787
Aren't you going to take measurements?

757
00:47:10.467 --> 00:47:12.206
You've gained half an inch for your waist.

758
00:47:14.307 --> 00:47:15.376
What a ghost.

759
00:47:43.836 --> 00:47:45.736
If you promise that you'll protect me,

760
00:47:46.267 --> 00:47:48.177
I'll repent for what I've sinned in the past.

761
00:47:50.407 --> 00:47:51.646
I promise.

762
00:47:52.546 --> 00:47:53.617
I...

763
00:47:54.577 --> 00:47:56.247
saw Park Chul Min.

764
00:47:57.486 --> 00:47:59.117
On December 21,

765
00:47:59.747 --> 00:48:01.416
when the lab caught on fire.

766
00:48:02.657 --> 00:48:04.887
I was a deliveryman for a restaurant then.

767
00:48:04.956 --> 00:48:06.287
Do you remember...

768
00:48:06.626 --> 00:48:08.697
that the cafeteria didn't open on Fright evenings?

769
00:48:09.796 --> 00:48:10.867
I do.

770
00:48:11.026 --> 00:48:13.796
I went to deliver snacks often on Friday nights.

771
00:48:13.936 --> 00:48:15.296
I was on my way to deliver food...

772
00:48:15.296 --> 00:48:16.867
that day too.

773
00:48:17.037 --> 00:48:18.267
I saw Park Chul Min...

774
00:48:18.566 --> 00:48:20.776
run out of the lab hurriedly.

775
00:48:22.677 --> 00:48:24.077
He could've done it...

776
00:48:24.077 --> 00:48:25.907
because he was surprised by the explosion.

777
00:48:26.206 --> 00:48:28.177
I thought the same at first.

778
00:48:28.717 --> 00:48:30.086
But one day, he suddenly bragged...

779
00:48:30.086 --> 00:48:32.546
that he changed his car and bought a house.

780
00:48:33.117 --> 00:48:34.517
He was usually such a mean customer...

781
00:48:34.517 --> 00:48:36.356
in our restaurant.

782
00:48:36.956 --> 00:48:38.686
So I threatened him to see how he'd react.

783
00:48:39.327 --> 00:48:42.097
I told him that I saw him that night.

784
00:48:42.856 --> 00:48:44.026
I asked him what he'd give me...

785
00:48:44.026 --> 00:48:45.396
in exchange for not telling it to the police.

786
00:48:48.497 --> 00:48:49.666
He gave me...

787
00:48:50.637 --> 00:48:52.367
a house and land.

788
00:48:54.606 --> 00:48:56.037
I'm sorry.

789
00:49:07.157 --> 00:49:09.416
I'll make sure to protect you.

790
00:49:09.986 --> 00:49:11.486
You can testify what you just said...

791
00:49:11.526 --> 00:49:13.756
to the police, right?

792
00:49:15.197 --> 00:49:16.197
I will.

793
00:49:17.066 --> 00:49:18.467
I think I need to do this...

794
00:49:18.467 --> 00:49:20.296
for my son to regain his consciousness.

795
00:49:20.936 --> 00:49:22.037
And...

796
00:49:24.467 --> 00:49:25.967
I'm sorry.

797
00:49:31.947 --> 00:49:33.276
Look at the camera.

798
00:49:33.276 --> 00:49:36.077
1, 2, 3, cheese.

799
00:49:39.887 --> 00:49:41.316
Cheese.

800
00:49:42.117 --> 00:49:44.227
That's enough.

801
00:49:44.227 --> 00:49:46.456
Let's eat now. All right.

802
00:49:51.626 --> 00:49:52.697
It's delicious.

803
00:49:53.767 --> 00:49:55.867
It has a history of more than 50 years.

804
00:49:55.867 --> 00:49:57.336
It's been a famous place...

805
00:49:57.336 --> 00:49:58.807
for proposals since long ago.

806
00:49:59.236 --> 00:50:01.876
No wonder. I'm so jealous.

807
00:50:02.537 --> 00:50:04.546
I think I've been here before.

808
00:50:05.977 --> 00:50:07.276
Did your ex...

809
00:50:07.276 --> 00:50:09.316
propose to you here before or something?

810
00:50:10.517 --> 00:50:12.787
What are you talking about?

811
00:50:13.086 --> 00:50:14.287
Eat up.

812
00:50:16.756 --> 00:50:18.157
It'll be great if I get proposed here...

813
00:50:18.157 --> 00:50:20.896
and come again for our wedding anniversary.

814
00:50:20.896 --> 00:50:22.396
Great, my foot.

815
00:50:22.396 --> 00:50:24.997
Who gets married nowadays? It's tacky.

816
00:50:24.997 --> 00:50:26.197
Just live alone.

817
00:50:26.396 --> 00:50:27.396
Gosh, ma'am.

818
00:50:27.396 --> 00:50:28.436
Marriage is a tomb.

819
00:50:28.436 --> 00:50:29.936
I'll get married even if it is.

820
00:50:31.566 --> 00:50:32.867
Wedding anniversary?

821
00:50:35.776 --> 00:50:36.847
Excuse me.

822
00:50:36.847 --> 00:50:37.876
Yes?

823
00:50:37.876 --> 00:50:39.776
Do you keep visitors' books...

824
00:50:39.876 --> 00:50:41.017
from the past?

825
00:50:41.017 --> 00:50:42.747
Yes, we do.

826
00:50:43.077 --> 00:50:44.517
Come this way.

827
00:50:53.086 --> 00:50:55.456
October 20.

828
00:50:55.997 --> 00:50:57.497
October...

829
00:51:08.436 --> 00:51:09.807
I found it.

830
00:51:11.407 --> 00:51:12.747
(Our 15th wedding anniversary!)

831
00:51:12.747 --> 00:51:14.017
(We met when we were 20.)

832
00:51:14.017 --> 00:51:15.276
(Now, we're Hae Ra's parents. I love you!)

833
00:51:20.557 --> 00:51:22.956
My dad was here that night.

834
00:51:29.896 --> 00:51:31.026
Hae Ra.

835
00:51:31.026 --> 00:51:32.927
What are you doing? Our dessert is here.

836
00:51:34.166 --> 00:51:36.706
Please give me a moment.

837
00:51:41.977 --> 00:51:45.646
(Blacksmith's)

838
00:51:45.646 --> 00:51:46.776
Soo Ho.

839
00:51:56.387 --> 00:51:58.157
I'm so relieved.

840
00:52:08.637 --> 00:52:09.936
I'm going to go home...

841
00:52:09.936 --> 00:52:11.267
and wear the ring that you proposed with.

842
00:52:14.807 --> 00:52:16.077
Do you still have a lot to do?

843
00:52:16.876 --> 00:52:17.876
Yes.

844
00:52:20.347 --> 00:52:22.217
I'll show you at home.

845
00:52:22.546 --> 00:52:23.546
Okay.

846
00:52:23.747 --> 00:52:24.847
See you.

847
00:52:51.077 --> 00:52:53.247
I remember the day when we first met.

848
00:52:53.747 --> 00:52:55.217
You walked in...

849
00:52:55.977 --> 00:52:58.017
with a cold and worn out face.

850
00:52:58.146 --> 00:52:59.787
Why did you call me here?

851
00:53:00.887 --> 00:53:02.157
Congratulations on your wedding.

852
00:53:02.756 --> 00:53:04.256
I heard it from your aunt.

853
00:53:04.657 --> 00:53:06.026
Did you meet Aunt Sook Hee?

854
00:53:06.256 --> 00:53:08.526
I'm making her a half-coat.

855
00:53:09.557 --> 00:53:11.327
I wasn't at that house. Don't worry.

856
00:53:11.327 --> 00:53:12.497
She came here.

857
00:53:14.467 --> 00:53:16.367
We're not getting married right away.

858
00:53:16.936 --> 00:53:18.006
Well...

859
00:53:18.637 --> 00:53:20.736
That might not happen forever.

860
00:53:21.506 --> 00:53:24.677
He can't marry someone whose dad killed his dad.

861
00:53:30.387 --> 00:53:31.816
Why did you want to see me?

862
00:53:32.186 --> 00:53:34.986
You wanted to wear a wedding dress by me.

863
00:53:36.727 --> 00:53:37.827
Not anymore.

864
00:53:37.827 --> 00:53:39.157
I'm going to make it.

865
00:53:39.927 --> 00:53:41.227
For you.

866
00:53:42.657 --> 00:53:43.997
I won't wear it.

867
00:53:45.626 --> 00:53:46.867
Goodbye then.

868
00:53:49.197 --> 00:53:51.137
I liked Moon Soo Ho.

869
00:53:54.506 --> 00:53:56.236
I couldn't help it.

870
00:53:58.077 --> 00:53:59.677
He's a great man.

871
00:54:03.177 --> 00:54:04.986
Why are you telling me this?

872
00:54:05.517 --> 00:54:07.017
Haven't I been pretty odd?

873
00:54:07.017 --> 00:54:08.456
You were very odd.

874
00:54:08.456 --> 00:54:10.256
It was because I liked him.

875
00:54:11.557 --> 00:54:12.727
But...

876
00:54:13.186 --> 00:54:14.896
I let him go.

877
00:54:16.557 --> 00:54:18.896
I want to make a dress for...

878
00:54:19.327 --> 00:54:21.166
his bride-to-be.

879
00:54:21.597 --> 00:54:22.666
Why?

880
00:54:24.106 --> 00:54:25.367
It makes me look cool.

881
00:54:26.407 --> 00:54:27.637
I still think...

882
00:54:28.436 --> 00:54:29.876
you're very odd.

883
00:54:34.276 --> 00:54:35.816
I'm going to make it.

884
00:54:45.327 --> 00:54:46.727
Next story.

885
00:54:46.727 --> 00:54:49.796
A gravesite dating back to the Joseon Dynasty was...

886
00:54:49.796 --> 00:54:52.967
found in a construction site in Eunseong-gu.

887
00:54:52.967 --> 00:54:54.396
It was found to be...

888
00:54:54.396 --> 00:54:57.106
Koo Jeom Bok's grave, whose identity is unknown.

889
00:54:57.606 --> 00:55:00.336
In his wooden coffin that was preserved perfectly,

890
00:55:00.336 --> 00:55:02.807
a story written in Korean along with pictures...

891
00:55:02.807 --> 00:55:05.807
and an earnest prayer was found.

892
00:55:05.807 --> 00:55:09.077
The academic world is giving it much attention.

893
00:55:09.316 --> 00:55:12.347
Reporter Kim Jin Seon will give you more details.

894
00:55:15.617 --> 00:55:16.956
Jeom Bok...

895
00:55:30.867 --> 00:55:31.867
("Bombarded With Rent After a Redevelopment")

896
00:55:46.086 --> 00:55:48.086
You were my husband,

897
00:55:48.956 --> 00:55:51.586
but you fell in love with my slave and dumped me.

898
00:56:22.117 --> 00:56:23.626
You look tired.

899
00:56:25.756 --> 00:56:26.856
Ms. Jang.

900
00:56:27.456 --> 00:56:29.057
Things have been very weird recently.

901
00:56:59.026 --> 00:57:00.526
That crazy brat said...

902
00:57:00.896 --> 00:57:03.467
some weird things when she was there.

903
00:57:05.296 --> 00:57:06.836
She's mentally unstable.

904
00:57:07.537 --> 00:57:08.936
You don't have to mind her words.

905
00:57:10.106 --> 00:57:12.336
And the story you told during your lecture...

906
00:57:13.066 --> 00:57:15.807
began to pop into my head like it was my past.

907
00:57:19.307 --> 00:57:20.316
That's because...

908
00:57:20.776 --> 00:57:22.916
I'm such a great storyteller.

909
00:57:23.146 --> 00:57:24.146
Ms. Jang.

910
00:57:25.546 --> 00:57:27.287
Do you believe in a past life?

911
00:57:30.486 --> 00:57:31.586
I'm not sure.

912
00:57:34.396 --> 00:57:37.697
I don't think everyone has a past life.

913
00:57:38.896 --> 00:57:40.236
But if you left...

914
00:57:40.836 --> 00:57:42.796
with longing or resentment,

915
00:57:45.637 --> 00:57:47.537
you might come back at least once.

916
00:57:48.736 --> 00:57:50.546
I don't believe in those things.

917
00:57:52.847 --> 00:57:54.347
Then don't.

918
00:57:55.247 --> 00:57:56.447
But...

919
00:57:57.017 --> 00:57:58.017
something is weird.

920
00:57:58.517 --> 00:57:59.947
I think there is something to this.

921
00:58:04.856 --> 00:58:07.927
Please draw them with your excellent talent.

922
00:58:09.026 --> 00:58:11.026
And please leave this unbelievable story...

923
00:58:12.066 --> 00:58:13.736
in writings.

924
00:58:21.936 --> 00:58:23.077
Soo Ho.

925
00:58:27.316 --> 00:58:28.517
Soon enough,

926
00:58:29.617 --> 00:58:31.146
a story and pictures from a grave dating back to...

927
00:58:31.146 --> 00:58:32.947
the Joseon Dynasty will be disclosed.

928
00:58:34.686 --> 00:58:35.686
That is...

929
00:58:36.787 --> 00:58:38.227
your past life.

930
00:59:03.617 --> 00:59:04.947
Just remember this.

931
00:59:06.046 --> 00:59:07.557
The woman who is dressed in silk,

932
00:59:07.557 --> 00:59:09.316
pretending to be your wife is...

933
00:59:09.316 --> 00:59:11.526
the wicked woman who killed you.

934
00:59:14.097 --> 00:59:15.227
You were meant to be...

935
00:59:16.997 --> 00:59:18.997
with the kind servant girl...

936
00:59:19.467 --> 00:59:21.066
with a burn scar on her face.

937
00:59:25.907 --> 00:59:27.506
A burn scar on her face?

938
00:59:31.106 --> 00:59:33.376
Isn't that what's uncanny about our fate?

939
00:59:34.416 --> 00:59:35.646
You also had...

940
00:59:36.517 --> 00:59:38.986
a burn scar on your face when you were young.

941
01:00:11.646 --> 01:00:13.856
- You look tired. - You look tired.

942
01:01:10.177 --> 01:01:12.546
(Black Knight)

943
01:01:12.706 --> 01:01:15.046
My ears are ringing, and I'm hearing things.

944
01:01:15.046 --> 01:01:17.017
Something about him has changed.

945
01:01:17.017 --> 01:01:19.617
I think my prayers are about to come true.

946
01:01:20.287 --> 01:01:22.057
- Go. - That's not it.

947
01:01:22.887 --> 01:01:25.387
Did you know Baek Hee is rather special?

948
01:01:25.387 --> 01:01:28.557
I need to know the prayer which Koo Jeom Bok wrote.

949
01:01:28.557 --> 01:01:30.767
Did Soo Ho find out that you've been sending texts?

950
01:01:30.767 --> 01:01:33.296
It was your dad who set the lab on fire,

951
01:01:33.296 --> 01:01:35.537
and it was him who killed Hae Ra's dad.

952
01:01:35.597 --> 01:01:37.066
Even if that had happened,

953
01:01:37.066 --> 01:01:38.606
nothing would change.

954
01:01:38.606 --> 01:01:40.106
Don't come here anymore.

955
01:01:40.106 --> 01:01:41.736
I love Hae Ra.

956
01:01:41.736 --> 01:01:43.407
I'll spend the rest of my life with her.
