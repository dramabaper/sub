00:00:06.771 --> 00:00:08.041
(The man called the king)

2
00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:09.510
(Meeting Dae Ho)

3
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.281
(Fierce master's lashing)

4
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:14.250
Master, are you a human?

5
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.351
The master is watching.

6
00:00:15.351 --> 00:00:16.750
(Fighting power blazes up.)

7
00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.851
(Cycle of infernal work out)

8
00:00:19.851 --> 00:00:22.820
(Let's go catch the tiger.)

9
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.720
(The members broke their legs...)

10
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.961
(while trying to catch up with the fierce master.)

11
00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:30.830
(All they have left is hunger and anger.)

12
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.461
(Will they be able to escape from infernal work out...)

13
00:00:32.461 --> 00:00:34.671
(and have the best dinner in the world?)

14
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.771
Are we done for today?

15
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.610
Let's go have dinner now.

16
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.379
Okay.

17
00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:43.350
(They've been waiting for...)

18
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.089
(meat.)

19
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.659
- Okay. - Let's go have delicious dinner.

20
00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:51.559
- Yes. - Thank you.

21
00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:53.229
Let's go have dinner.

22
00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:54.900
- Great. - This is so heavy.

23
00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:57.769
- Meat? - It's meat. It's dinner.

24
00:00:58.129 --> 00:00:59.229
Do you have lotion?

25
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.139
This one. You just use this.

26
00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:03.469
- It contains everything. - Is it a toner and lotion?

27
00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:04.940
- Yes. All in one. - I like those ones.

28
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.839
- I know. One second. - Me too.

29
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.309
- This cover everything? - Yes.

30
00:01:10.309 --> 00:01:11.680
(Even if you're hungry, don't eat it.)

31
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.380
- It smells nice. - I know.

32
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.779
- It's good. - It's...

33
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.949
We're going to have meat for dinner.

34
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.490
- I think he's very thorough. - I know.

35
00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.190
He eats on time.

36
00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.460
- It's going to be so delicious. - I can't wait.

37
00:01:26.559 --> 00:01:28.460
It's going to taste wonderful.

38
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.559
(Since we worked out hard, it's going to taste even better.)

39
00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:32.770
- Okay. - Okay.

40
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.139
We're on the way...

41
00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:38.339
- to eat meat. - Why am I so excited to eat meat?

42
00:01:38.339 --> 00:01:40.740
- I'm so excited. - It's so nice.

43
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.880
(They head towards the master's house talking in twang.)

44
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.309
What's the main dish, Master?

45
00:01:45.309 --> 00:01:46.880
Beef or pork?

46
00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.119
My wife just said it's meat.

47
00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:50.580
I'm not sure.

48
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.690
What if there are all kinds of meat?

49
00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.589
(It doesn't matter which meat it is.)

50
00:01:57.589 --> 00:01:59.259
I'm going crazy.

51
00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:00.630
(It doesn't matter what kind of meat it is.)

52
00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:04.729
(Their sincere heart towards meat...)

53
00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.869
(will not change.)

54
00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.700
We climbed the mountain and worked out,

55
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.969
so if we have a meal or meat now,

56
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.839
I feel like all the nutrition will go inside my muscles.

57
00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:19.050
(Muscular)

58
00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:21.879
- It'll go inside my muscles. - It's best to eat meat now.

59
00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:25.050
We have to eat it as soon as we can.

60
00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:27.520
I'll probably eat a lot.

61
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.189
(Easy.)

62
00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:33.159
I should call her.

63
00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.860
- Hold on. - Is it your wife?

64
00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.670
What does it say?

65
00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:40.839
- "Everything in my life". - "Everything in my life".

66
00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:42.339
Is it heart everything in my life. heart?

67
00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:45.569
(What kind of person is the master's wife?)

68
00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.839
- Really? Yes. - Honey.

69
00:02:48.779 --> 00:02:51.779
- She's really beautiful. - I know.

70
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.480
We're on our way, Honey.

71
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.879
- Hello. - Hello.

72
00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:57.349
Hello.

73
00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:59.249
Hello.

74
00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:00.990
(Master's family. Everything in my life.)

75
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.089
Look at how big Hyo Rin is now.

76
00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.200
Yes, Uncle. Hyo Rin's grown up a lot.

77
00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:10.099
Look at Hyo Rin.

78
00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.099
(Daughter's daddy can't stop smiling.)

79
00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.869
She has grown up so much.

80
00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:16.569
Put me down.

81
00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:18.670
- Hi. - Hi.

82
00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:20.779
- Hello. I'm Yuk Seong Jae. - It's funny already.

83
00:03:20.779 --> 00:03:21.980
- She's smiling already. - She's smiling already.

84
00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.939
- Hello. - Yes.

85
00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:27.779
We've worked out so much that we're very hungry.

86
00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:30.319
I'll make something delicious.

87
00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:32.390
Yes.

88
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.360
(It's a party tonight.)

89
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.219
- Thank you. - Yes.

90
00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:37.360
Come on.

91
00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:41.460
I'm looking forward to it. All I can think of is a meal.

92
00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:42.559
Me too.

93
00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:45.170
Just the thought of it makes me happy.

94
00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:47.170
I have a question, Master.

95
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.300
(Single man Seung Gi is curious all of a sudden.)

96
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.809
What's the advantage of getting married?

97
00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:53.439
I used to live alone.

98
00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:56.439
It's best when I don't have to go dark home.

99
00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:57.950
Especially in winter.

100
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.150
When I go home all exhausted,

101
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.619
my wife greets me with food ready.

102
00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:06.390
My children run to greet me...

103
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:07.990
in the warm house.

104
00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:12.659
It gives me the driving force to live diligently.

105
00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:13.659
(My driving force...)

106
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.400
(that makes me run harder)

107
00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:21.339
(Our driving force is meat.)

108
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.570
(While she roasts meet,)

109
00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.609
(sister watches her brother.)

110
00:04:30.609 --> 00:04:31.679
(Peeping)

111
00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:34.349
(Uncles. Are you inside here?)

112
00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:36.950
(Dad and hungry uncles arrive.)

113
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.250
- We're here. - We're here.

114
00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.190
- Hey, the smell. - The smell of meat.

115
00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.859
I can smell it even though the door's closed.

116
00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.130
- It's beef. - It's a torture.

117
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.330
(Noisy)

118
00:04:50.299 --> 00:04:52.070
(It's Dad.)

119
00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:54.739
It's the baby.

120
00:04:54.739 --> 00:04:56.669
- Hello. - Hello.

121
00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:58.510
- Hello. - Hello.

122
00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.370
- Hello. - Hi.

123
00:05:00.739 --> 00:05:02.779
- Hey. - Hello.

124
00:05:03.109 --> 00:05:04.510
He's cute.

125
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.849
- You've done a good job today. - No.

126
00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.779
(Lee Ye Seung)

127
00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:11.390
- Hi, Hyo Rin. - Excuse me.

128
00:05:12.049 --> 00:05:14.719
- You must be Hyo Rin. - Say hello.

129
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.489
(Lee Hyo Rin)

130
00:05:16.859 --> 00:05:18.560
(Father and daughter look alike.)

131
00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.599
(And everything in his life)

132
00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.270
(Shin Hye Jung)

133
00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.770
(There's no fierce master.)

134
00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.599
(He has a generous smile of a dad.)

135
00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.770
Let's take a look around the house first before we eat.

136
00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.679
It's nice.

137
00:05:35.679 --> 00:05:38.880
- I'll show you the master bedroom. - Yes.

138
00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.510
Can I take a look around the house?

139
00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.049
Is it okay to look at the bedroom? We should ask your wife.

140
00:05:43.049 --> 00:05:44.520
- It's fine. - Is it?

141
00:05:44.989 --> 00:05:47.020
We'll look at it slightly.

142
00:05:47.049 --> 00:05:48.089
It's old.

143
00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:49.390
(They check Master's bedroom under his wife's permission.)

144
00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:50.659
I mean...

145
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.489
- Dad. - Let's take a look together.

146
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.630
- Let's show the guests our house. - It's nice.

147
00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:56.799
- Ask him for a hug. - He's cute.

148
00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:58.770
Ye Seung. Ask him for a hug.

149
00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:59.870
- Is his name Ye Seung? - Yes.

150
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.969
- Ask him for a hug. - Ye Seung.

151
00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:04.370
(Give me a hug, Uncle.)

152
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:07.679
(They carry one in their arms and tour the house.)

153
00:06:07.679 --> 00:06:09.679
- This is incredible. - These are gold medals.

154
00:06:09.679 --> 00:06:10.779
Gold medal from the Olympics.

155
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.750
- This is the gold medal. - 2008.

156
00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.080
WBC silver medal.

157
00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.380
- This is the gold medal. - 2008.

158
00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:20.890
This is the bronze medal from my very first team.

159
00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.320
- You have all medals. - You have all medals.

160
00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.359
I do.

161
00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:26.890
- This frame is really wonderful. - You'll sleep in this room tonight.

162
00:06:27.859 --> 00:06:29.429
You're going to sleep in this room tonight.

163
00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:32.330
I don't reveal this room often.

164
00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:39.370
(When you follow the shining trace of the master,)

165
00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:40.570
(you reach the closed secret room.)

166
00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:42.580
Can we sleep in this room for real?

167
00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:44.849
- We're going to sleep in here? - This is incredible.

168
00:06:44.849 --> 00:06:46.679
- You're going to sleep here. - Can we do this?

169
00:06:46.679 --> 00:06:48.880
- This is the only room we have. - Can we sleep here?

170
00:06:49.679 --> 00:06:52.589
- My goodness. - Awesome. This is awesome.

171
00:06:53.549 --> 00:06:56.020
(Here is...)

172
00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.460
(the master's treasure warehouse.)

173
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.560
(The gold, silver, bronze medals were only just the beginning.)

174
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:08.070
(Collected for 18 years)

175
00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:10.200
(Lee Dae Ho's baseball career)

176
00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:14.609
(My goodness.)

177
00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:17.880
(The place for today is very luxurious.)

178
00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.250
I feel so happy just to be here.

179
00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:22.380
Although I'm not a baseball player...

180
00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.250
In this case, there are some displayed here.

181
00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:28.390
My goodness.

182
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:29.560
(Because of the luxurious interior, he's full of adrenaline.)

183
00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:31.089
Hold on. This is unbelievable.

184
00:07:32.729 --> 00:07:34.130
Because of people like him,

185
00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:36.099
I installed a surveillance camera in this room.

186
00:07:36.229 --> 00:07:37.969
I can see that one.

187
00:07:37.969 --> 00:07:39.029
(I'm watching you.)

188
00:07:39.169 --> 00:07:42.469
- What I treasure most are all here. - Really?

189
00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.070
This is wonderful.

190
00:07:45.969 --> 00:07:47.640
Among these,

191
00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.710
I can see the wedding declaration and written oath of marriage.

192
00:07:50.909 --> 00:07:54.250
- He's definitely romantic. - Hyo Rin, Ye Seung, go outside.

193
00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:56.020
The meaning of it preserving here is...

194
00:07:56.179 --> 00:07:58.750
- that it's a treasure. - Of course, it's a family treasure.

195
00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:00.760
(Dae Ho's treasure number 1, that made this family)

196
00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.260
Master, do those balls all have meanings?

197
00:08:04.929 --> 00:08:06.830
These have...

198
00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:09.700
- my wife's name on. - I see.

199
00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:11.270
(On the autographed balls, there are his wife's names.)

200
00:08:13.729 --> 00:08:15.770
(The home-run of my life)

201
00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:17.940
(Gifts for the wife)

202
00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:20.710
(I'm your 4th batter.)

203
00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:25.510
For all baseball fans and all prospective baseball players,

204
00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:28.950
it might be their dream to come into this room.

205
00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:31.250
They might want to have a room like this.

206
00:08:31.689 --> 00:08:34.319
If you sleep here,

207
00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:36.459
- you'll all be fortunate in 2018. - You're right.

208
00:08:36.459 --> 00:08:39.390
We'll get good fortune from this room.

209
00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:42.699
(Since we received good fortune here,)

210
00:08:42.699 --> 00:08:46.500
(we'd like to receive some food to fill our stomach.)

211
00:08:49.799 --> 00:08:52.640
Hyo Rin, are we ready to eat?

212
00:08:53.069 --> 00:08:55.010
- No. - Not yet?

213
00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:56.110
(I see...)

214
00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:58.010
- Take some rest. - Can we stay here?

215
00:08:58.010 --> 00:08:59.980
- When the food is ready... - Yes.

216
00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:01.380
Have a seat to take a rest.

217
00:09:01.779 --> 00:09:03.350
I don't think I can lie down here.

218
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:05.949
- Se Hyeong. - Yes.

219
00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:07.760
There's a camera here.

220
00:09:08.059 --> 00:09:10.829
- I should stay like this. - I'll be watching you all the time.

221
00:09:10.829 --> 00:09:12.529
I'll keep myself like this. I mean it.

222
00:09:12.529 --> 00:09:14.059
Be careful.

223
00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:16.760
(On the face of the master, who is heading to the living room,)

224
00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.130
(it's full of smile.)

225
00:09:21.199 --> 00:09:23.539
(Finally, those two can greet each other properly.)

226
00:09:25.439 --> 00:09:27.240
You cooked a lot.

227
00:09:27.409 --> 00:09:28.840
You cooked so much.

228
00:09:29.279 --> 00:09:30.539
Is it done?

229
00:09:30.539 --> 00:09:32.880
(They talk about how they spent the day.)

230
00:09:32.949 --> 00:09:35.650
I only have it while working out.

231
00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:38.220
I sweat a lot. It was too hot.

232
00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:40.049
(Master Daeho becomes a cute bear in front of his wife.)

233
00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.590
(The members are done with looking around the room.)

234
00:09:45.189 --> 00:09:46.559
I should take some rest.

235
00:09:47.929 --> 00:09:49.959
(Hiking in the morning)

236
00:09:49.959 --> 00:09:51.199
(Harsh training in the afternoon)

237
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:54.400
(He becomes exhausted.)

238
00:09:55.569 --> 00:09:59.809
(At that time, a baby is...)

239
00:09:59.909 --> 00:10:02.880
(toward Seung Gi.)

240
00:10:04.279 --> 00:10:05.909
- Get up. - Shouldn't we find it together?

241
00:10:05.909 --> 00:10:07.279
- Shouldn't we find it together? - Really?

242
00:10:07.279 --> 00:10:08.319
I found one.

243
00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:09.949
Ye Seung...

244
00:10:10.449 --> 00:10:12.990
You should cure him.

245
00:10:13.549 --> 00:10:15.159
(Seung Gi, are you hurt?)

246
00:10:15.159 --> 00:10:16.390
(Curing)

247
00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.890
(Curing badly)

248
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.500
(For Seung Gi, who passed out,)

249
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.529
(he's doing CPR wildly.)

250
00:10:25.529 --> 00:10:26.730
(Don't get passed out.)

251
00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:30.439
I'm sorry. Sorry. Are you really two years old?

252
00:10:30.569 --> 00:10:32.010
Are you sure?

253
00:10:33.539 --> 00:10:34.740
Abs.

254
00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:35.980
Stress the abdominal.

255
00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:37.079
(All right. I'll give up my nap to play with them.)

256
00:10:39.279 --> 00:10:40.350
I found it.

257
00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:42.150
I found the treasure that our master mentioned.

258
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:44.220
- What's this? - Yes?

259
00:10:45.549 --> 00:10:46.990
- What's this? - It's a camera.

260
00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:48.990
(Hyo Rin is curious about everything.)

261
00:10:50.419 --> 00:10:52.890
You're on the camera. It's shooting you.

262
00:10:53.559 --> 00:10:55.459
Do it like this.

263
00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:56.730
Come closer.

264
00:10:57.699 --> 00:10:59.000
I'm going to speak.

265
00:11:01.569 --> 00:11:02.939
The treasure that our master mentioned...

266
00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:04.870
Hold on. Don't.

267
00:11:05.309 --> 00:11:06.939
- You should do it this way. - Good job.

268
00:11:06.939 --> 00:11:08.679
Like this. Make the camera shoot only my face.

269
00:11:08.939 --> 00:11:10.279
I found the profound meaning that our master tried to convey.

270
00:11:10.279 --> 00:11:11.309
(He's trying to shoot himself once again.)

271
00:11:11.309 --> 00:11:12.809
(Failed)

272
00:11:13.679 --> 00:11:15.020
(What Se Hyeong wanted to say...)

273
00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:17.179
(couldn't be heard forever.)

274
00:11:18.419 --> 00:11:21.120
(Opening of Seung Gi Land for Ye Seung)

275
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:24.260
(Seung Gi plays with him while he's still hungry.)

276
00:11:26.929 --> 00:11:28.329
(Giggling)

277
00:11:30.829 --> 00:11:33.230
(In Seung Gi Land, Ye Seung becomes so much happy.)

278
00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:35.169
One more time?

279
00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:43.679
(Seung Gi is doing well as the children's favorite guy.)

280
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:45.409
What is this?

281
00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.279
(Something is wrong...)

282
00:11:49.279 --> 00:11:51.120
(with his face.)

283
00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:54.319
- Why is he crying in all of sudden? - What's going on?

284
00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.929
(From time to time, trial comes...)

285
00:11:57.929 --> 00:11:59.189
(from just nowhere.)

286
00:11:59.189 --> 00:12:00.329
What's going on?

287
00:12:00.329 --> 00:12:01.559
(Oh no...)

288
00:12:01.559 --> 00:12:02.699
Are you done?

289
00:12:02.699 --> 00:12:06.429
(At that moment, dinner is ready to be served.)

290
00:12:06.429 --> 00:12:08.470
(Their mom is coming to call the members.)

291
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:10.000
- Let's have dinner. - Yes.

292
00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:13.010
- Now? - He made Ye Seung cry.

293
00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.309
(He made Ye Seung cry.)

294
00:12:15.309 --> 00:12:16.980
Seung Gi really made him cry.

295
00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:18.549
- In all of a sudden... - What is it?

296
00:12:18.549 --> 00:12:19.579
Just before...

297
00:12:19.579 --> 00:12:21.449
(It's unfair. I've been playing with you all along.)

298
00:12:21.449 --> 00:12:23.020
He's been crying all along.

299
00:12:23.549 --> 00:12:26.890
That's not true.

300
00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:28.260
I've been playing with him all along.

301
00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.590
- Se Hyeong, is that you again? - No, it wasn't me.

302
00:12:31.689 --> 00:12:33.590
It was him.

303
00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:34.929
No, I didn't do anything.

304
00:12:34.929 --> 00:12:37.260
- He treated him harshly. - Let's just eat. We're hungry.

305
00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:38.730
Let's have dinner.

306
00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:40.529
Seung Gi, why did you do that?

307
00:12:40.529 --> 00:12:41.569
Call the uncles.

308
00:12:41.569 --> 00:12:45.809
(It's time to comfort me who's been working so hard.)

309
00:12:45.809 --> 00:12:47.809
(The 1st proper meal to eat after 12 hours)

310
00:12:47.809 --> 00:12:49.340
- It's awesome. - My goodness.

311
00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:50.510
What's this?

312
00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:51.549
(Impressed)

313
00:12:51.949 --> 00:12:54.380
- They look really amazing. - Right.

314
00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:56.679
It's like something you can have only in the restaurant.

315
00:12:57.350 --> 00:13:00.390
(Are we having a course meal?)

316
00:13:04.559 --> 00:13:07.159
(And is it an appetizer?)

317
00:13:08.299 --> 00:13:13.770
This is all you eat for dinner.

318
00:13:14.069 --> 00:13:17.039
(What?)

319
00:13:19.409 --> 00:13:20.880
You all know I'm on diet.

320
00:13:21.709 --> 00:13:23.510
(I wanted to escape from that word.)

321
00:13:24.709 --> 00:13:27.549
- Ye Seung. - So, it's not an appetizer.

322
00:13:27.949 --> 00:13:29.220
Is it all we eat?

323
00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:30.850
This is all.

324
00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:32.350
(During the winter training season,)

325
00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:33.919
(the master persists eating only this menu.)

326
00:13:33.919 --> 00:13:35.590
I said not to fix any more food.

327
00:13:36.689 --> 00:13:39.329
(No way.)

328
00:13:39.329 --> 00:13:41.699
(It can't be true.)

329
00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:44.730
(There must be some food left in the kitchen.)

330
00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:47.840
(Nothing)

331
00:13:48.569 --> 00:13:50.299
- What about meat? - We have some meat here.

332
00:13:50.299 --> 00:13:53.770
(We have some meat here in the green.)

333
00:13:55.909 --> 00:13:58.350
(All I can do is...)

334
00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:00.579
(smiling.)

335
00:14:00.919 --> 00:14:03.419
- I mean... - I don't usually eat such things.

336
00:14:03.419 --> 00:14:04.850
She brought this not to make you starve.

337
00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:06.090
This is awesome.

338
00:14:06.949 --> 00:14:08.789
(Today...)

339
00:14:08.789 --> 00:14:12.730
(I endured that harsh training...)

340
00:14:13.029 --> 00:14:16.959
(because of hope that the dinner would be hearty.)

341
00:14:17.569 --> 00:14:19.029
While I'm on a diet,

342
00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.299
I don't eat after 6 o'clock.

343
00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.409
I thought this was just... an appetizer.

344
00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:26.709
So did I.

345
00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:29.110
- We thought there would be... - Help yourself.

346
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:30.709
- I'm sorry, but help yourself. - Thank you for the food.

347
00:14:30.709 --> 00:14:32.850
(I'm sorry, but help yourself.)

348
00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:34.949
(Thank you for the food.)

349
00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.819
Are you sure that he's really eating like this?

350
00:14:38.819 --> 00:14:40.150
Yes. Actually, he eats less.

351
00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:42.490
- Really? - That wouldn't work.

352
00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:46.230
For about two days, I want to eat something.

353
00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:48.900
After 2 days, I feel okay on the 3rd day.

354
00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.000
I get used to hunger.

355
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.270
Do you really get used to it? On the third day?

356
00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:54.500
I do.

357
00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:57.539
- This is what I must do. - I see.

358
00:14:57.539 --> 00:14:59.809
I tolerate hunger during this season.

359
00:15:00.069 --> 00:15:01.380
Let's have dinner.

360
00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:03.309
- Yes. Thank you. - Thank you.

361
00:15:03.309 --> 00:15:05.179
- Help yourself. - Thank you for the food.

362
00:15:07.579 --> 00:15:12.350
(The meaning that he never meets people for dinner in December...)

363
00:15:12.549 --> 00:15:15.860
(was this.)

364
00:15:18.029 --> 00:15:20.459
Hyo Rin, there's no food for me to eat either.

365
00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.529
Just eat. What do you want to eat?

366
00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:25.630
The red one?

367
00:15:26.069 --> 00:15:27.970
That's for Seong Jae.

368
00:15:28.669 --> 00:15:31.039
This meat must weigh...

369
00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:33.740
around 60g.

370
00:15:34.409 --> 00:15:36.340
Is there more meat underneath the salad?

371
00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:37.480
Not at all.

372
00:15:37.549 --> 00:15:39.549
- There's no more meat. - Of course not.

373
00:15:40.779 --> 00:15:42.120
This looks delicious though.

374
00:15:43.949 --> 00:15:45.650
Can I eat more vegetables?

375
00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:49.789
The sweet potato is so tasty.

376
00:15:49.789 --> 00:15:50.860
(Eating everything preciously)

377
00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:53.630
(I want to feel the entirety of this taste.)

378
00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:57.299
(Licking)

379
00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:58.630
(He even eats the green fallen on the table.)

380
00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:00.470
This one...

381
00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:02.740
is so tasty.

382
00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:04.340
(Seong Jae is eating the salad as if he's eating ramyeon.)

383
00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:06.409
(He's never seen such a thing before for 25 months of his life.)

384
00:16:08.779 --> 00:16:12.949
(With a few uses of chopsticks,)

385
00:16:12.949 --> 00:16:15.350
(the salad is already getting done.)

386
00:16:16.779 --> 00:16:18.490
(He eats very well.)

387
00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:24.230
(Sang Yun also cleared up the food.)

388
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:26.260
Did you make it only with omija and olive oil?

389
00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.459
- And shiitake too. - Sang Yun...

390
00:16:28.459 --> 00:16:31.000
He just drank up the food.

391
00:16:31.429 --> 00:16:33.100
He drank it up.

392
00:16:33.299 --> 00:16:35.439
I think mine was lesser than the others.

393
00:16:38.169 --> 00:16:41.740
(Everyone is still eating.)

394
00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:43.980
(Seong Jae is moving his fingers all alone.)

395
00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:47.750
(He already ate up even the nuts.)

396
00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:51.850
Honey, do we have almond and some other nuts?

397
00:16:52.689 --> 00:16:54.319
(H's excited.)

398
00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:57.159
- Give him some nuts. - Are nuts okay?

399
00:16:57.159 --> 00:16:58.559
I feel too bad for Seong Jae.

400
00:16:58.559 --> 00:17:00.159
(The master approves Seong Jae's big appetite.)

401
00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:03.060
When you come next time, I will cook something delicious.

402
00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:04.269
- It's okay. - That's all right.

403
00:17:04.269 --> 00:17:05.600
- This is enough. - It's all right.

404
00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:06.699
- We have to... - It's...

405
00:17:06.699 --> 00:17:09.669
copy the master's lifestyle.

406
00:17:10.769 --> 00:17:12.469
(At that moment,)

407
00:17:12.469 --> 00:17:14.840
(Ye Seung gets a refill.)

408
00:17:14.979 --> 00:17:17.179
(Oh,)

409
00:17:17.179 --> 00:17:20.850
(that's where all the protein is going.)

410
00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:22.019
(I'm jealous.)

411
00:17:22.019 --> 00:17:23.320
- He's... - Eat more meat, Ye Seung.

412
00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:26.550
(Is it good, Ye Seung?)

413
00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:27.860
(Come on, Sang Yun.)

414
00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:29.489
It looks very delicious.

415
00:17:30.459 --> 00:17:33.530
(The hunger makes him malfunction.)

416
00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:39.370
(They feel like all the moisture in their mouth...)

417
00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:42.239
(has been dried out.)

418
00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:48.939
Ye Seung, is it good?

419
00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:50.949
Are you going to eat all the strawberries?

420
00:17:53.679 --> 00:17:54.919
Get it with your fork and give him one.

421
00:17:55.479 --> 00:17:57.150
(Please give me one for playing with you.)

422
00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:58.290
Give him one.

423
00:17:58.749 --> 00:18:00.689
(He gives Seung Gi a strawberry.)

424
00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:06.429
(It saves Seung Gi.)

425
00:18:06.489 --> 00:18:08.699
(He's analyzing how to get a strawberry.)

426
00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.800
Give me one too.

427
00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:12.600
(He sticks out his head and opens his mouth.)

428
00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:14.269
Thank you.

429
00:18:16.269 --> 00:18:18.439
(They are desperate for a strawberry.)

430
00:18:18.439 --> 00:18:20.070
- Are you going to give me one? - It's amazing, isn't it?

431
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:22.479
(Se Hyeong follows Sang Yun's formula.)

432
00:18:24.749 --> 00:18:25.909
Give him one too.

433
00:18:25.909 --> 00:18:26.949
(Ye Seung is a generous man.)

434
00:18:26.949 --> 00:18:28.019
You should answer.

435
00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.050
You eat well. Is it good?

436
00:18:31.949 --> 00:18:33.120
Ye Seung?

437
00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:35.820
(Because of the intense training,)

438
00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:39.030
(their hunger is not satisfied.)

439
00:18:40.259 --> 00:18:42.030
Ma'am, by the way...

440
00:18:42.459 --> 00:18:45.370
(What is it?)

441
00:18:46.429 --> 00:18:49.570
That leftover meat is going to the bin anyway.

442
00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:53.239
Let's bet two pieces...

443
00:18:53.469 --> 00:18:55.280
Let us fight for the two pieces.

444
00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:59.209
Give it to the person you like the most.

445
00:18:59.249 --> 00:19:01.120
- A game? - Just two pieces.

446
00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.380
(The eyes of the hungry men...)

447
00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:04.519
(are starting to sparkle again.)

448
00:19:04.519 --> 00:19:06.019
(Sounds good.)

449
00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:09.060
(Seong Jae is desperate for food.)

450
00:19:09.159 --> 00:19:11.790
(He starts singing.)

451
00:19:15.159 --> 00:19:20.900
(While missing the meat, a day passed.)

452
00:19:22.699 --> 00:19:25.709
(It's a serenade for the meat.)

453
00:19:26.939 --> 00:19:28.009
(Isn't it lovely?)

454
00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:31.110
(He's really desperate, isn't he?)

455
00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:35.350
(He's annoyed because he's too good.)

456
00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:39.249
Missing you

457
00:19:39.689 --> 00:19:41.390
(He sings as if he's having a concert.)

458
00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:43.459
How can you sing so seriously at the dinner table?

459
00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:46.390
(She's enchanted by him.)

460
00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:48.900
I want to give it to him.

461
00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.600
(Let's be friends)

462
00:19:53.469 --> 00:19:55.699
(He creates noise.)

463
00:19:56.540 --> 00:20:00.669
(That's not it.)

464
00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:01.979
(He gives up.)

465
00:20:01.979 --> 00:20:04.679
- He sang so sincerely. - He was amazing.

466
00:20:04.679 --> 00:20:06.580
I was so desperate to eat meat.

467
00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:07.979
(He sold his soul for two pieces of meat.)

468
00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:10.749
(I am the sincere one though.)

469
00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:15.759
I will act a line from a drama.

470
00:20:17.429 --> 00:20:19.060
Everyone's showing his specialty.

471
00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:20.090
(They're betting everything for two pieces of meat.)

472
00:20:20.189 --> 00:20:22.530
Can you ask me where I am now?

473
00:20:22.759 --> 00:20:24.729
- Where are you now? - Wait.

474
00:20:24.729 --> 00:20:27.030
- You should put your heart into it. - Put your heart into it.

475
00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:28.300
- My gosh. - Is she shy?

476
00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:30.100
I think she's won over by Seong Jae.

477
00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:31.340
Let's try it.

478
00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:34.709
Ready. Action.

479
00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:36.810
Where are you now?

480
00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:39.949
I am on the way to the airport.

481
00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:42.380
(He's determined too.)

482
00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:46.550
You know that we're almost there, right?

483
00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:49.659
You know that we're almost there, right?

484
00:20:49.989 --> 00:20:51.790
(Her heart races.)

485
00:20:52.759 --> 00:20:55.030
Sang Yun, her husband is right there looking at you.

486
00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:57.900
- Right. - How can you flirt?

487
00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:00.100
His fist nearly launched.

488
00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.040
- Anyway... - You almost...

489
00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:03.199
got beaten up.

490
00:21:03.199 --> 00:21:06.070
You're the one giving the meat. So you decide.

491
00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:08.280
(She's pleasantly perplexed.)

492
00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:09.640
I bet my life on meat.

493
00:21:11.949 --> 00:21:13.350
(What is this now?)

494
00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:16.479
(He even closes his eyes...)

495
00:21:16.479 --> 00:21:18.890
(and sings with 200 percent of his emotions.)

496
00:21:19.519 --> 00:21:21.459
(Seung Gi...)

497
00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:24.989
(He immerses into the song.)

498
00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:29.229
(He's desperate, isn't he?)

499
00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:33.370
(He sings with all his heart...)

500
00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:36.300
(for two pieces of meat.)

501
00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:39.739
(He might sing a whole song if nobody stops him.)

502
00:21:42.479 --> 00:21:43.739
(The master's wife is satisfied.)

503
00:21:43.739 --> 00:21:45.880
Seung Gi. I am nearly crying.

504
00:21:46.949 --> 00:21:48.350
It got me emotional.

505
00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:50.479
- I sang with my heart. - What's wrong with them?

506
00:21:50.479 --> 00:21:52.219
Do they have to do this for two pieces of meat?

507
00:21:52.219 --> 00:21:54.790
Just choose one person.

508
00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:56.159
(I won't be able to eat.)

509
00:21:56.489 --> 00:21:58.030
I really sang with my heart.

510
00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:00.290
- You did. - I was really desperate for meat.

511
00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:02.729
You must've practiced singing a lot while serving the army.

512
00:22:03.759 --> 00:22:06.300
I expressed my desperation for two pieces of meat.

513
00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:08.300
You were really desperate.

514
00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:10.400
Since they all tried hard,

515
00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:13.110
let's give the winner 3 pieces and the runner-up 1 piece.

516
00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:14.239
(The winner gets 3 pieces, and the runner-up gets 1 piece.)

517
00:22:14.239 --> 00:22:16.739
- That's not bad at all. - How about the bottom one?

518
00:22:16.739 --> 00:22:17.780
The runner-up gets one piece.

519
00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:19.150
The bottom one doesn't get anything.

520
00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:20.409
Is there nothing for the bottom one?

521
00:22:20.679 --> 00:22:22.620
The winner gets 3 pieces, and the runner up gets 1 piece.

522
00:22:22.679 --> 00:22:23.880
- Should we close our eyes? - Close your eyes.

523
00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:25.150
This is unbelievable.

524
00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:28.120
If I open my eyes and see meat, I will be so happy.

525
00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:29.390
Only the winner will get three pieces of meat.

526
00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:30.620
Here we go.

527
00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:31.689
(It's the moment of truth.)

528
00:22:33.489 --> 00:22:34.659
(They gave everything...)

529
00:22:34.659 --> 00:22:38.100
(for this moment.)

530
00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:42.140
(She announces the runner-up first.)

531
00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:46.669
(Who did she choose?)

532
00:22:50.709 --> 00:22:52.679
(It's Seong Jae.)

533
00:22:52.679 --> 00:22:54.719
(Seong Jae is the runner-up.)

534
00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:56.880
I am so happy.

535
00:22:57.890 --> 00:22:59.189
(He's thrilled.)

536
00:22:59.189 --> 00:23:00.249
Thank you.

537
00:23:02.259 --> 00:23:03.759
(I am so jealous.)

538
00:23:05.689 --> 00:23:06.830
I will announce the winner.

539
00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:09.530
This is the happiness a piece of meat gives.

540
00:23:09.759 --> 00:23:11.100
- The winner gets three pieces. - The winner...

541
00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:12.630
- gets three pieces. - It might be too far for her.

542
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:14.300
The winner gets three pieces.

543
00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:15.800
You should put yours here.

544
00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:16.840
(She chooses the big pieces.)

545
00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:20.509
- Se Hyeong, Sang Yun, Seung Gi. - The saucy one is Se Hyeong's.

546
00:23:20.509 --> 00:23:22.909
- All right. - I should've sung too.

547
00:23:22.909 --> 00:23:24.810
We will close your eyes.

548
00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:26.449
Who would it be?

549
00:23:26.449 --> 00:23:28.019
(They are so desperate...)

550
00:23:28.019 --> 00:23:30.580
(for 3 pieces of meat.)

551
00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:31.850
I want it so badly.

552
00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:39.820
(Master's Wife gives the meats to the 1st place winner she likes the most. )

553
00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:43.780
(They are so desperate to be the winner!!)

554
00:23:45.319 --> 00:23:46.648
(Screaming)

555
00:23:47.619 --> 00:23:49.490
(What happened?)

556
00:23:50.389 --> 00:23:52.520
(Sang Yun wins.)

557
00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.790
Yes!

558
00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:57.260
(The 3 pieces of meat went to Sang Yun.)

559
00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:00.000
- Seung Gi. - It's...

560
00:24:00.599 --> 00:24:02.629
It's hard to win someone's heart with just a song.

561
00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:06.899
Seung Gi failed to win her heart.

562
00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:09.540
You thought hard until the end, right?

563
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:12.179
I didn't know that she was Sang Yun's fan.

564
00:24:12.179 --> 00:24:14.010
- Thank you. - Thank you.

565
00:24:14.409 --> 00:24:15.450
Thank you.

566
00:24:15.579 --> 00:24:16.750
Thank you for the meat.

567
00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:21.250
It's really delicious.

568
00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:25.060
It's amazing.

569
00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:26.820
(Seung Gi stares at the meat.)

570
00:24:27.119 --> 00:24:28.490
My gosh.

571
00:24:28.829 --> 00:24:29.889
My gosh.

572
00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:31.899
(He defends his meat perfectly.)

573
00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:33.429
Did you see it?

574
00:24:33.429 --> 00:24:34.659
- He's so fast. - He guarded his meat.

575
00:24:35.869 --> 00:24:37.169
I will give you this.

576
00:24:37.169 --> 00:24:39.669
(Se Hyeong shares a peanut.)

577
00:24:39.669 --> 00:24:42.740
By this time, I should head out...

578
00:24:42.869 --> 00:24:44.570
and exercise again.

579
00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:46.010
That's a lie.

580
00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:47.710
(Exercise again?)

581
00:24:48.409 --> 00:24:50.609
If you beat me, I will treat you barbecue.

582
00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:53.320
(Barbecue?)

583
00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:56.490
I promise you. You can eat as much as you want.

584
00:24:56.490 --> 00:24:57.619
- As much as we want? - Yes.

585
00:24:57.619 --> 00:24:59.889
There's a good barbecue restaurant. I will take you there.

586
00:24:59.889 --> 00:25:02.829
How would we beat you?

587
00:25:02.829 --> 00:25:04.899
- What is it? - As long as it's not a fight.

588
00:25:04.899 --> 00:25:08.570
If we do this,

589
00:25:08.669 --> 00:25:10.070
I won't cut you any slack.

590
00:25:10.169 --> 00:25:12.339
- I will do everything to win. - I won't cut you slack either.

591
00:25:12.939 --> 00:25:14.839
You need to be fair when you play sports.

592
00:25:14.869 --> 00:25:16.270
We have to win.

593
00:25:17.669 --> 00:25:19.079
(His eyes change.)

594
00:25:20.939 --> 00:25:23.379
(Escape 1.)

595
00:25:24.349 --> 00:25:26.950
(Playing alone time)

596
00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:30.050
(They ran in the mountain even before they met him.)

597
00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:32.990
(Lunch)

598
00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:35.030
(They had an apple for lunch.)

599
00:25:35.129 --> 00:25:36.659
(They fought against Chul Soo.)

600
00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:39.730
(They fought against Chul Soo.)

601
00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:42.000
(They experienced the intense training of a national athlete.)

602
00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:44.700
(Dinner)

603
00:25:45.169 --> 00:25:46.639
(They had salad with 2 pieces of meat.)

604
00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:49.210
(The last exercise...)

605
00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:50.470
(will end this infernal chain.)

606
00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:51.740
This is the moment.

607
00:25:52.079 --> 00:25:53.179
Let's go.

608
00:25:53.179 --> 00:25:54.849
- Let's eat meat. - Let's go.

609
00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:56.780
We have to win.

610
00:25:56.849 --> 00:26:00.480
We have to eat something. I am starved.

611
00:26:00.619 --> 00:26:02.990
Let's win. We can win.

612
00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:06.490
We can win with the will to eat.

613
00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:08.230
Of course.

614
00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:10.159
(He laughs at them.)

615
00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:12.599
Is the stadium outdoors?

616
00:26:12.599 --> 00:26:15.230
- We are going quite far. - We will do it over there.

617
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.129
Over there?

618
00:26:17.329 --> 00:26:19.040
- What's that? - What's that?

619
00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:20.240
(What awaits them is...)

620
00:26:21.939 --> 00:26:23.109
It's a dodge ball court.

621
00:26:23.369 --> 00:26:25.609
I haven't played a dodge ball in such a long time.

622
00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:29.109
(Anyway, who are these people...)

623
00:26:29.109 --> 00:26:31.649
(warming up for the game?)

624
00:26:33.619 --> 00:26:35.189
Chul Soo!

625
00:26:35.619 --> 00:26:37.250
- What? - Is he Chul Soo?

626
00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:39.189
Chul Soo!

627
00:26:39.189 --> 00:26:40.290
(They're sick of the name Chul Soo.)

628
00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:41.359
You're here.

629
00:26:42.189 --> 00:26:43.990
Is he here again?

630
00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:46.530
(It was the worst thing...)

631
00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:48.800
(they ever experienced.)

632
00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:51.070
(It's called Chul Soo.)

633
00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:52.339
- Let's stop this. - Where are you going?

634
00:26:52.339 --> 00:26:54.740
- Come on. - The bicycle...

635
00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:59.210
Chul Soo is an athlete.

636
00:26:59.439 --> 00:27:01.980
- Hello. - He's also...

637
00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:04.450
a personal trainer at the gym I go to in Busan.

638
00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:06.849
- Why is everyone an athlete? - He only brought athletes.

639
00:27:06.849 --> 00:27:09.490
He's a trainer. Is he a dodgeball player?

640
00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:13.159
He's got a lot more muscles.

641
00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:14.859
He's not an athlete. He's a trainer too.

642
00:27:14.859 --> 00:27:17.230
It's obvious that he's an athlete.

643
00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:18.960
- He's an athlete. - He is.

644
00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:22.169
- I have never played a dodgeball. - See? He can't play it.

645
00:27:22.169 --> 00:27:23.730
- Okay. - You said you were confident.

646
00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:25.040
And you're already complaining?

647
00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:26.270
We are confident.

648
00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:28.070
All right. Fine.

649
00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.869
Even if you lose, you can't frown.

650
00:27:30.869 --> 00:27:32.879
You shouldn't cry when you lose.

651
00:27:34.439 --> 00:27:36.079
(What?)

652
00:27:36.079 --> 00:27:39.480
I'll tell you a story. I once played dodgeball in middle school.

653
00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:41.149
(And?)

654
00:27:41.889 --> 00:27:45.889
I hit one of my friends, and the ball bursted.

655
00:27:46.089 --> 00:27:47.220
Just remember that.

656
00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:48.730
Is it possible for this ball to burst?

657
00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:50.960
I didn't know it could burst.

658
00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:53.060
- The ball bursted? - I just...

659
00:27:53.329 --> 00:27:54.599
hit my friend, and it bursted.

660
00:27:54.599 --> 00:27:56.329
But you're stronger now.

661
00:27:56.329 --> 00:27:57.929
I am not good at it now.

662
00:27:57.929 --> 00:28:00.270
But you grab the ball with one hand.

663
00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:01.839
Isn't it how you're supposed to grab it?

664
00:28:01.839 --> 00:28:03.639
Nobody has bursted a dodge ball...

665
00:28:03.639 --> 00:28:06.139
since Dan Titan's father did it on "Dodge Danpei".

666
00:28:06.139 --> 00:28:07.240
I've never heard about anyone else doing it.

667
00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:09.250
- The flame shoot. - And he shot it to the wall.

668
00:28:10.079 --> 00:28:12.119
(We tried to imagine what it was like.)

669
00:28:12.119 --> 00:28:15.849
(This is what would've happened to Dae Ho's friend.)

670
00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:19.659
We need to figure out how to stop him from hitting us.

671
00:28:19.659 --> 00:28:20.760
We have to defend well.

672
00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:21.829
Just...

673
00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:23.329
catch the ball.

674
00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:25.800
The ball he throws? The ball bursted last time.

675
00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.429
It bursted last time.

676
00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:29.500
It will be a shame if it bursts.

677
00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:32.270
I will practice throwing.

678
00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:33.639
(He practices throwing the ball.)

679
00:28:33.639 --> 00:28:35.909
No way.

680
00:28:36.639 --> 00:28:39.939
(Is that our future?)

681
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:43.109
- No way. - Let's not catch it.

682
00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:45.250
We can't catch it.

683
00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:46.950
(Despite the continuous threat,)

684
00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:49.990
If we see him coming at us with full force,

685
00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:51.790
we will know what to do.

686
00:28:52.189 --> 00:28:53.520
I think his ball points downwards.

687
00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.460
Even if we understand his ball, we can't catch it.

688
00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:57.530
Let's fight him by moving a lot.

689
00:28:57.530 --> 00:28:59.200
- Let's move a lot. - He's right.

690
00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:01.500
Should we begin?

691
00:29:01.599 --> 00:29:04.070
If you beat us today, I'll treat you barbecue.

692
00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:07.339
- You will treat us. - I will treat you tonight.

693
00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:10.770
Okay. Let's eat meat.

694
00:29:10.810 --> 00:29:13.980
- Go, All the Meats! - Go, All the Meats!

695
00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:16.109
(They are obsessed with meat.)

696
00:29:16.109 --> 00:29:18.450
Let's do this.

697
00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:19.649
(We will show you what hunger can do.)

698
00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:21.450
- Let's do this. - Come on!

699
00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:22.589
- Let's go! - Let's go!

700
00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:24.649
- Let's start. - Where do we go?

701
00:29:24.649 --> 00:29:25.760
- Wherever. - All right.

702
00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:27.589
Let's do a jump.

703
00:29:28.329 --> 00:29:31.260
I will throw it to the middle. Ready.

704
00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:32.300
And go.

705
00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:34.730
Nice.

706
00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:35.899
And go.

707
00:29:37.129 --> 00:29:38.240
Nice.

708
00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:39.240
(Sang Yun jumped well.)

709
00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:40.970
Okay. Okay.

710
00:29:42.939 --> 00:29:44.040
(Chul Soo is flustered.)

711
00:29:45.439 --> 00:29:46.879
They will attack first.

712
00:29:47.179 --> 00:29:49.250
Look at him.

713
00:29:49.609 --> 00:29:51.619
(Should I throw or not?)

714
00:29:52.349 --> 00:29:54.450
He's going there.

715
00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:55.649
(He's got fancy footsteps.)

716
00:29:55.919 --> 00:29:58.149
You can't go over the line.

717
00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:00.220
(He confuses the other players...)

718
00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:02.359
(and passes the ball to his teammate.)

719
00:30:03.189 --> 00:30:05.730
Just don't hit my face.

720
00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:07.329
(I tricked you.)

721
00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:09.570
Why is he coming to my side?

722
00:30:09.629 --> 00:30:11.369
(He spots Chul Soo.)

723
00:30:11.369 --> 00:30:12.800
Don't do this to me.

724
00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:15.169
(You gave us such a hard time.)

725
00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:17.470
Don't do this to me.

726
00:30:17.869 --> 00:30:19.139
We have enough time.

727
00:30:19.439 --> 00:30:20.980
Okay.

728
00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:24.510
We have enough time.

729
00:30:24.919 --> 00:30:26.879
Nice job!

730
00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:28.919
- I did it. - All right!

731
00:30:28.919 --> 00:30:31.050
Chul Soo, out!

732
00:30:31.119 --> 00:30:33.490
- Isn't the ball mine? - That's not how it works.

733
00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:35.230
I think the ball is mine.

734
00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:36.490
- They did it. - We got Chul Soo.

735
00:30:36.530 --> 00:30:38.530
- Chul Soo, out! - You can stay there.

736
00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:39.800
We're fine as long as we don't go out of the line.

737
00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:41.669
- I wanted to get two. - He's too tall.

738
00:30:41.899 --> 00:30:43.000
Was it intentional?

739
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.270
(The current score is 3 to 2.)

740
00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:48.339
(Seung Gi is filled with confidence.)

741
00:30:48.339 --> 00:30:49.869
- We have a chance. - Where is his hand?

742
00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:51.210
It must be hard for you.

743
00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:52.379
(He runs.)

744
00:30:52.379 --> 00:30:53.740
That's it. That's good.

745
00:30:54.179 --> 00:30:55.609
(The downside of moving around a lot is that you get tired too.)

746
00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:57.379
They're good.

747
00:30:57.450 --> 00:30:59.849
- Here. - That's it. Pass it quickly.

748
00:30:59.849 --> 00:31:02.589
Let's make them tired. Make them tired.

749
00:31:03.849 --> 00:31:05.960
- I think you're going to get tired. - It takes so long.

750
00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:08.589
Wait. It's coming.

751
00:31:08.589 --> 00:31:11.329
Don't make me nervous.

752
00:31:11.329 --> 00:31:13.329
I shouldn't get nervous.

753
00:31:13.329 --> 00:31:14.429
What are you doing?

754
00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:19.439
What was that? He must be tired.

755
00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:21.339
- Okay. - Play carefully.

756
00:31:21.339 --> 00:31:22.540
- What's going on? - Stop.

757
00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:25.109
They're moving around too much.

758
00:31:28.909 --> 00:31:30.079
(He caught the ball.)

759
00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:32.379
He's good! Gosh!

760
00:31:32.379 --> 00:31:33.480
(Everyone panics.)

761
00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:37.189
Seong Jae, you can't go over the line.

762
00:31:37.419 --> 00:31:38.560
I am so scared.

763
00:31:40.084 --> 00:31:45.084
<font color="#F1E6B2">[VIU Ver] E05 Master in the House / All the Butlers</font>
<font color="#E06287">"Dinner with Master Dae Ho"</font>
<font color="#7474C1">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

764
00:31:47.159 --> 00:31:48.429
(The master caught the ball.)

765
00:31:48.429 --> 00:31:50.300
I once hit my friend, and the ball bursted.

766
00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:53.740
(They're scared.)

767
00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:55.210
(They are terrified.)

768
00:31:56.810 --> 00:31:58.040
I am so scared.

769
00:31:59.810 --> 00:32:00.810
(The ball passes by them.)

770
00:32:00.810 --> 00:32:02.510
- Seung Gi got it. - Nice.

771
00:32:02.609 --> 00:32:04.710
You cross the line.

772
00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:08.919
- Here. - That's it. Make a short pass.

773
00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:10.919
They are trying to make us tired.

774
00:32:10.919 --> 00:32:13.260
- No! - Yes!

775
00:32:13.589 --> 00:32:14.859
(Seung Gi hits another one.)

776
00:32:14.859 --> 00:32:16.889
- Seung Gi is good. - Out.

777
00:32:16.929 --> 00:32:18.260
- Out. - Seung Gi is good.

778
00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:19.899
We are winning right now.

779
00:32:19.899 --> 00:32:21.460
- We have to do better. - Take it slow.

780
00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:23.000
Just think that you're grabbing the ball.

781
00:32:24.629 --> 00:32:26.099
Just think that you're grabbing the ball.

782
00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:27.899
(No way.)

783
00:32:28.339 --> 00:32:29.810
Just think that you're grabbing the ball.

784
00:32:31.609 --> 00:32:32.710
Catch it.

785
00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:33.909
(Sang Yun got hit,)

786
00:32:33.909 --> 00:32:34.950
Okay!

787
00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:36.149
(but Seong Jae saved him.)

788
00:32:36.149 --> 00:32:37.480
Catch it.

789
00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:39.119
He caught it. He caught it.

790
00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:41.849
- You caught it. - Yes!

791
00:32:41.849 --> 00:32:43.950
- Take it slowly. - Get closer.

792
00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:45.389
Yes! Yes!

793
00:32:45.389 --> 00:32:46.960
- No! No! - Meat! Meat! Meat!

794
00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:50.060
- Meat! Meat! Meat! Meat! - Meat! Meat! Meat! Meat!

795
00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:51.189
(Their obsession with meat is scary.)

796
00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:53.700
What is this?

797
00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:57.070
All right.

798
00:32:57.099 --> 00:32:59.070
- Go, All the Butlers! - Go!

799
00:32:59.470 --> 00:33:02.109
- Let's eat meat. - Here. Slow down.

800
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:06.140
(Now...)

801
00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:07.640
(only one enemy remains.)

802
00:33:08.879 --> 00:33:11.209
(They are determined to take him down...)

803
00:33:11.209 --> 00:33:13.379
(and eat barbecue.)

804
00:33:14.649 --> 00:33:16.649
(Since it's an important moment,)

805
00:33:16.649 --> 00:33:18.820
(they play more carefully.)

806
00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:21.930
- All right. - Watch your back.

807
00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:23.830
- Watch your back. - That's it.

808
00:33:23.959 --> 00:33:26.200
- No. - Yes!

809
00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:28.930
- No. - Yes!

810
00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:31.700
(Seung Gi...)

811
00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:33.740
(ends the game with his last shoot.)

812
00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:34.839
Barbecue!

813
00:33:34.839 --> 00:33:38.339
(The special forces soldier didn't disappoint us.)

814
00:33:38.910 --> 00:33:40.479
Yes! Yes!

815
00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:43.050
That was amazing.

816
00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:44.950
(Seung Gi hit 1 man.)

817
00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:46.620
(Seung Gi hit 2 men.)

818
00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:47.649
(Seung Gi hit 3 men.)

819
00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:51.019
(Seung Gi made the barbecue party come true.)

820
00:33:51.019 --> 00:33:54.320
- Meat! Meat! Meat! - Meat! Meat! Meat!

821
00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:56.530
We lost to your passion for meat.

822
00:33:56.530 --> 00:33:59.629
- Meat! Meat! Meat! - Meat! Meat! Meat!

823
00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:01.769
- Meat! Meat! - Meat! Meat!

824
00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:04.300
- You played well. - Perfect.

825
00:34:04.629 --> 00:34:05.970
- It was perfect. - We did it.

826
00:34:05.970 --> 00:34:07.570
- It was perfect. - Nice job.

827
00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:09.769
Let's do the last ceremony.

828
00:34:09.809 --> 00:34:10.910
This is...

829
00:34:10.910 --> 00:34:13.180
- All the Meats. - All the Meats.

830
00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:15.649
- We did it. - We did it.

831
00:34:16.209 --> 00:34:17.510
How can they be so desperate for meat?

832
00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:19.350
- Wasn't it too easy? - We lost...

833
00:34:19.350 --> 00:34:21.379
to their passion for meat.

834
00:34:21.379 --> 00:34:22.649
- I will treat you. - We did it.

835
00:34:22.649 --> 00:34:23.950
- It was a good game. - We are...

836
00:34:24.089 --> 00:34:25.760
quite athletic.

837
00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:27.820
- We were desperate. - The desperation did it.

838
00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:29.830
Our desperation made us win.

839
00:34:29.830 --> 00:34:32.700
- Good job, Seong Jae. - You did well.

840
00:34:32.729 --> 00:34:35.100
- We did well. - Smile a little.

841
00:34:35.999 --> 00:34:37.629
- We did well. - We won.

842
00:34:37.629 --> 00:34:39.169
Smile a little.

843
00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:41.809
(He forces himself.)

844
00:34:42.339 --> 00:34:44.669
If you frown, we can't enjoy the victory.

845
00:34:45.910 --> 00:34:47.640
- It was a fair game. - Should we head there?

846
00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:49.749
- Let's go. - Let's go.

847
00:34:50.479 --> 00:34:53.080
Meat. Meat. Meat.

848
00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:54.890
- This is the place. - This is it.

849
00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:56.289
- This is a famous place. - Let's go in.

850
00:34:56.289 --> 00:34:57.649
It looks delicious.

851
00:34:57.649 --> 00:35:00.089
This is where baseball players always come and eat.

852
00:35:00.089 --> 00:35:01.260
- Really? - There are a lot of autographs.

853
00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:02.430
Let's go inside.

854
00:35:02.589 --> 00:35:04.330
- Hello. - There are a lot of autographs.

855
00:35:04.330 --> 00:35:05.430
Hello.

856
00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:09.129
- This is how it looks inside. - They're all from baseball players.

857
00:35:09.499 --> 00:35:11.269
He got autographs from everyone.

858
00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:14.970
(The baseball players' autographs covered the wall.)

859
00:35:15.339 --> 00:35:16.339
(Lee Dae Ho)

860
00:35:16.339 --> 00:35:20.010
(He always came here whenever he came back to Korea.)

861
00:35:20.439 --> 00:35:23.149
All the baseball players in Korea came here.

862
00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:24.609
(Ryu Hyun Jin, Lee Seung Yuop, and Park Chan Ho)

863
00:35:24.919 --> 00:35:26.280
(Park Chan Ho)

864
00:35:26.479 --> 00:35:28.589
Look at all of those signed balls.

865
00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:30.749
This is a really nice place.

866
00:35:31.019 --> 00:35:32.459
It's a very charming place.

867
00:35:33.559 --> 00:35:37.129
(We get that it's a charming place.)

868
00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:39.430
I want to eat like crazy.

869
00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:40.800
(They are famished.)

870
00:35:41.669 --> 00:35:44.470
(Let's drink water until the meat is served.)

871
00:35:46.039 --> 00:35:47.839
(Now...)

872
00:35:47.839 --> 00:35:50.010
Please start grilling the meat.

873
00:35:50.010 --> 00:35:51.240
You can pack the grill.

874
00:35:52.109 --> 00:35:54.539
We can grill it here and move it to their grill.

875
00:35:54.539 --> 00:35:55.879
(Finally, we get to eat meat.)

876
00:35:56.910 --> 00:35:59.319
(They start with beautiful beef brisket.)

877
00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:03.290
(It's meat.)

878
00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:04.759
It looks so delicious.

879
00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:08.930
It's for free.

880
00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:11.600
It takes a long time to grill beef tripe.

881
00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:13.060
Beef brisket cooks fast.

882
00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:15.029
He serves it as an appetizer.

883
00:36:15.370 --> 00:36:16.600
It's thinly sliced.

884
00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:19.270
You don't have to cook it completely, right?

885
00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:20.339
- Isn't it okay to eat it raw? - No.

886
00:36:20.339 --> 00:36:23.109
- That's to raw. - Wait a little bit.

887
00:36:23.109 --> 00:36:24.540
(Let me eat. I'm dizzy.)

888
00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:28.480
Seong Jae is really starved. Give him some dongchimi.

889
00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:31.149
He can have it while he waits.

890
00:36:31.149 --> 00:36:32.980
- Dongchimi. - Try it.

891
00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:34.890
- I really love dongchimi. - Try it.

892
00:36:38.189 --> 00:36:42.589
(Eating dongchimi is the best way to quench your thirst.)

893
00:36:43.089 --> 00:36:45.029
This is what this restaurant should be famous for.

894
00:36:45.129 --> 00:36:46.560
(Everything tastes like a Michelin star restaurant food.)

895
00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:47.830
This dongchimi is amazing.

896
00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:51.669
It looks so delicious.

897
00:36:51.669 --> 00:36:53.399
(Finally, the beef brisket is cooked golden brown.)

898
00:36:53.439 --> 00:36:54.540
It's cooked now.

899
00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:56.970
I will add some chilies.

900
00:36:57.470 --> 00:36:58.739
Thank you for the food.

901
00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:08.290
She made the dongchimi herself.

902
00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:15.189
(This is it.)

903
00:37:15.189 --> 00:37:16.259
It's amazing.

904
00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:19.430
(He's happy.)

905
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:21.330
The sauce...

906
00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:28.069
The sauce seems very special.

907
00:37:28.109 --> 00:37:30.009
When you eat it...

908
00:37:30.009 --> 00:37:31.209
(Everyone is busy eating.)

909
00:37:31.209 --> 00:37:33.939
The sauce helps the juice from the beef brisket...

910
00:37:33.939 --> 00:37:35.779
to spread in your mouth.

911
00:37:35.779 --> 00:37:36.879
(I am talking,)

912
00:37:36.879 --> 00:37:38.720
(but nobody is listening.)

913
00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:41.180
(Let's just eat.)

914
00:37:42.089 --> 00:37:43.120
(Everyone is eating so well.)

915
00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:44.189
This is unbelievable.

916
00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:48.390
By the way, it looks...

917
00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:50.259
unbelievably delicious.

918
00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:52.730
It's amazing.

919
00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:54.459
(They start eating the grilled beef tripe.)

920
00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:55.970
It's really delicious.

921
00:37:55.970 --> 00:37:58.470
(Se Hyeong makes a lettuce wrap.)

922
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.209
I need to come here again.

923
00:38:02.209 --> 00:38:03.310
(And Seung Gi makes a wrap too.)

924
00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:05.640
When you come here on a rainy day,

925
00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:08.009
you will have to crawl out.

926
00:38:08.149 --> 00:38:10.980
Do you have a really big lettuce leaf?

927
00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:12.080
I have it.

928
00:38:12.350 --> 00:38:13.680
I love lettuce.

929
00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:15.089
Please give me one more bowl of sauce.

930
00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:23.359
(What is he doing?)

931
00:38:24.899 --> 00:38:28.069
I can eat one meal with just one wrap.

932
00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:33.799
I am going to divide up the space in my mouth and chew it.

933
00:38:35.739 --> 00:38:38.109
I really love beef tripe.

934
00:38:38.839 --> 00:38:40.209
I will add pickled Alpine leek.

935
00:38:40.209 --> 00:38:41.580
(He can't stop watching him.)

936
00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:42.879
I will add green onion kimchi.

937
00:38:43.049 --> 00:38:46.020
I will dip each piece of beef tripe in a different sauce.

938
00:38:46.379 --> 00:38:48.720
Do we have a cooked one we can give to him?

939
00:38:49.049 --> 00:38:50.649
This is cooked. This is the beef tripe.

940
00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:52.089
What are you putting next?

941
00:38:52.089 --> 00:38:54.060
- Beef tripe. - Beef tripe is next.

942
00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:56.660
You should put beef brisket on top.

943
00:38:56.660 --> 00:38:57.790
Right.

944
00:38:59.029 --> 00:39:00.560
One.

945
00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:04.069
- 2. - He put 3 pieces of tripe...

946
00:39:04.069 --> 00:39:05.339
3 pieces of intestine.

947
00:39:05.339 --> 00:39:06.799
He put 3 pieces of tripe and 3 pieces of intestine.

948
00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:09.140
Can you manage putting everything in your mouth?

949
00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:11.009
His mouth is quite big.

950
00:39:11.009 --> 00:39:12.839
- Just open your mouth big. - How about the beef brisket?

951
00:39:12.839 --> 00:39:14.080
You have to add the beef brisket too.

952
00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:15.910
One piece of beef brisket.

953
00:39:16.609 --> 00:39:18.180
He's adding everything.

954
00:39:18.319 --> 00:39:19.950
It's beef brisket wrap.

955
00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:22.189
- Isn't it hot? - Look at the steam.

956
00:39:22.189 --> 00:39:24.390
- Won't your mouth be burned? - He will burn his mouth.

957
00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:25.459
That's unbelievable.

958
00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:27.120
Can you really put everything in your mouth?

959
00:39:27.759 --> 00:39:30.689
Move your fingers. It's actually huge.

960
00:39:30.859 --> 00:39:32.200
It's very big.

961
00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:34.399
Shouldn't you protect your image as an idol?

962
00:39:34.459 --> 00:39:35.600
I will...

963
00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:38.239
(It's okay.)

964
00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:42.040
- Is there anything else to add? - Why would you squeeze that?

965
00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:45.009
Here we go.

966
00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:48.680
(When Seong Jae's mouth opens,)

967
00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:52.049
(everyone's mouth opens.)

968
00:39:52.049 --> 00:39:53.120
Here we go.

969
00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:54.350
(The juice is dripping.)

970
00:39:55.419 --> 00:39:56.790
Everything went in.

971
00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:59.689
(He ate everything.)

972
00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:03.790
(I can't believe he ate that.)

973
00:40:04.459 --> 00:40:06.029
(Even the owner is impressed.)

974
00:40:08.029 --> 00:40:09.830
He's amazing.

975
00:40:10.830 --> 00:40:12.439
I think I will be chewing this until we get home.

976
00:40:14.839 --> 00:40:17.509
This is... My goodness.

977
00:40:17.810 --> 00:40:19.209
Look at this.

978
00:40:19.209 --> 00:40:22.149
(The juice is spreading in my veins.)

979
00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:24.410
Don't cry.

980
00:40:24.410 --> 00:40:27.450
You can't be more touched than when you heard In Kwon's song.

981
00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:28.890
(Even if the world ends tomorrow, I will make a beef tripe wrap.)

982
00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:31.390
- It's so delicious. - Are you happy?

983
00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:33.720
It's so delicious.

984
00:40:33.989 --> 00:40:36.089
(This is why people call Seong Jae "Handsome Psycho".)

985
00:40:36.089 --> 00:40:37.489
It's delicious.

986
00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:40.660
It doesn't have the unpleasant odor.

987
00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:42.470
(While everyone is enjoying it,)

988
00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:45.799
(the master is...)

989
00:40:45.799 --> 00:40:49.470
(not eating at all.)

990
00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:52.680
(He's being patient.)

991
00:40:54.779 --> 00:40:56.049
(It looks delicious.)

992
00:40:56.049 --> 00:40:57.509
(He swallows his saliva.)

993
00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:01.149
The tripe is burning.

994
00:41:01.149 --> 00:41:03.020
(Seeing the meat cooking right before his eyes is torturing.)

995
00:41:04.549 --> 00:41:06.520
I want to eat it too.

996
00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:10.589
Isn't it okay if you bend the rule for one day?

997
00:41:10.959 --> 00:41:13.500
I've decided to lose weight in two months.

998
00:41:13.899 --> 00:41:15.700
So I will stick to my plan.

999
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.669
I am a professional athlete, so I have to manage myself well.

1000
00:41:20.239 --> 00:41:23.640
By eating, I will be losing to myself.

1001
00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:25.480
Is that why you won't eat?

1002
00:41:25.709 --> 00:41:27.580
If I eat once, I will eat again.

1003
00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:29.549
I hate that.

1004
00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:33.419
You are very relentless.

1005
00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:37.020
I think you need to be relentless if you want to be successful.

1006
00:41:37.390 --> 00:41:39.520
- You love eating so much. - I know.

1007
00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:41.020
And you gave that up.

1008
00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:43.060
That's the hardest thing to do.

1009
00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:45.230
(He never makes compromises with himself.)

1010
00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:48.370
When we go home, we have to sleep.

1011
00:41:48.629 --> 00:41:50.069
I need to choose who's going to sleep beside me.

1012
00:41:50.069 --> 00:41:52.270
- I need to choose one. - Is that person...

1013
00:41:52.439 --> 00:41:53.739
going to sleep on the floor next to you?

1014
00:41:53.739 --> 00:41:58.109
The person who sleeps next to me will get one of my treasures.

1015
00:41:58.109 --> 00:41:59.509
Your treasure?

1016
00:41:59.509 --> 00:42:00.680
(He's going to give a treasure to his roommate?)

1017
00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:03.810
- Really? - I will give you...

1018
00:42:03.810 --> 00:42:06.250
one of my treasures in the room.

1019
00:42:06.549 --> 00:42:10.250
How precious are those to you?

1020
00:42:10.350 --> 00:42:13.089
They are very precious to me.

1021
00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:14.930
I cherish them so much.

1022
00:42:17.959 --> 00:42:21.470
I shouldn't be giving it to you, but I will give it to you.

1023
00:42:21.569 --> 00:42:23.370
It's hard for me to give it up.

1024
00:42:25.569 --> 00:42:27.700
The moment I heard this,

1025
00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:30.810
I saw this vision. In life,

1026
00:42:31.509 --> 00:42:32.879
there are moments like this.

1027
00:42:33.109 --> 00:42:34.879
When he spoke about it,

1028
00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:37.980
I could see it being in my house.

1029
00:42:39.149 --> 00:42:42.020
I feel comfortable now because I think I'll get it.

1030
00:42:42.450 --> 00:42:44.620
(I think I will get it.)

1031
00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:46.720
You should just ask for it.

1032
00:42:46.919 --> 00:42:48.129
I can't do that.

1033
00:42:48.129 --> 00:42:49.430
- Just ask for it. - What's the logic?

1034
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:51.459
How can he not give it to you?

1035
00:42:51.459 --> 00:42:53.730
Sometimes, fate plays a part.

1036
00:42:55.069 --> 00:42:57.270
Does this vegetable make you hallucinate?

1037
00:42:58.029 --> 00:42:59.770
There are times when that happens.

1038
00:42:59.770 --> 00:43:01.069
(He's immersed in his own world.)

1039
00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:03.410
How do we choose one person?

1040
00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:04.540
(How should they choose the master's roommate?)

1041
00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:06.239
What should we do? Finger flick?

1042
00:43:06.910 --> 00:43:08.779
- Do you have to endure it? - How about pulling the sideburns?

1043
00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:11.180
- What's that? - You pull the sideburns.

1044
00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:12.580
Pulling the sideburns might be better.

1045
00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:13.850
Then...

1046
00:43:14.149 --> 00:43:16.319
When they are pulled...

1047
00:43:16.549 --> 00:43:17.720
- You have to endure the pain. - You have to endure the pain.

1048
00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:19.160
Can you win the treasure if you endure the pain?

1049
00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:20.390
Yes. You can't make any sound.

1050
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:23.129
- What if we let the master do it? - Yes. Let him do it.

1051
00:43:23.259 --> 00:43:24.390
That's not a bad idea.

1052
00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.060
- Okay. - The master will do it.

1053
00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:28.470
(If you want,)

1054
00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:31.129
(I will gladly do it.)

1055
00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:34.040
(Wouldn't our hair get pulled out...)

1056
00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:36.209
(if he pulls?)

1057
00:43:36.209 --> 00:43:37.310
Cheers.

1058
00:43:38.410 --> 00:43:39.640
Ready.

1059
00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:40.640
(In order to win the treasure,)

1060
00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:42.080
(they have to put up with the master's tender hand.)

1061
00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:43.279
Ready.

1062
00:43:44.209 --> 00:43:46.220
- Okay. - Ready.

1063
00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:48.290
Go.

1064
00:43:48.450 --> 00:43:52.459
- Give me the sign. - Start.

1065
00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:55.029
That surprised me.

1066
00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:59.629
(The dream of winning a treasure flew off didn't even last a second.)

1067
00:43:59.629 --> 00:44:02.100
I think he screamed even before I counted to one.

1068
00:44:02.529 --> 00:44:03.669
- Is it that bad? - How many seconds did he last?

1069
00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:05.470
He didn't even last one second.

1070
00:44:05.470 --> 00:44:07.439
- Not even one second. - This is...

1071
00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:08.810
- Let's play among ourselves. - Half of...

1072
00:44:08.810 --> 00:44:10.640
Half of my face is in pain.

1073
00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:13.739
- Don't scare us. - You experienced it.

1074
00:44:15.649 --> 00:44:17.350
- Let's play among ourselves. - This side...

1075
00:44:17.350 --> 00:44:18.919
It hurts too much.

1076
00:44:18.919 --> 00:44:20.879
(Seong Jae experienced the pain,)

1077
00:44:20.879 --> 00:44:23.850
(and Seung Gi is terrified.)

1078
00:44:23.919 --> 00:44:25.089
I will be gentle.

1079
00:44:25.089 --> 00:44:27.020
- It hurts too much. - You can endure it.

1080
00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:28.629
Ready.

1081
00:44:28.730 --> 00:44:30.330
- Ready. - Why does it still hurt?

1082
00:44:30.330 --> 00:44:32.100
(How many seconds would he be able to last?)

1083
00:44:32.330 --> 00:44:34.029
Ready and go.

1084
00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:35.200
One.

1085
00:44:35.970 --> 00:44:37.830
(As soon as it began,)

1086
00:44:37.830 --> 00:44:39.040
(he started to twitch.)

1087
00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:43.109
(The master twists his hand.)

1088
00:44:43.109 --> 00:44:46.080
1, 2, 3.

1089
00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:47.180
- I can't grab his hair. - Four.

1090
00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:49.279
- You can't twist it. - Five seconds.

1091
00:44:49.279 --> 00:44:50.779
It's more than five seconds.

1092
00:44:50.779 --> 00:44:53.649
(He nearly cursed.)

1093
00:44:53.649 --> 00:44:55.149
It hurts. It really hurts.

1094
00:44:56.489 --> 00:44:58.720
Seong Jae, what does this make you?

1095
00:44:58.720 --> 00:44:59.859
You lasted 0.95 second.

1096
00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:01.319
Here we go.

1097
00:45:01.319 --> 00:45:03.660
(Next is Se Hyeong.)

1098
00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:06.100
Start.

1099
00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:07.930
(He's the master of enduring pain.)

1100
00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:09.669
One.

1101
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:14.140
(He seemed to endure it.)

1102
00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:16.169
(But he failed right away.)

1103
00:45:16.270 --> 00:45:17.470
His whole face must hurt.

1104
00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:22.279
(The thrill spreads throughout his body.)

1105
00:45:22.279 --> 00:45:23.879
Your whole face hurts, doesn't it?

1106
00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:26.279
I thought my skin was going to peel off.

1107
00:45:26.279 --> 00:45:28.020
You know that you were like a girl, don't you?

1108
00:45:29.250 --> 00:45:30.520
You did this.

1109
00:45:30.890 --> 00:45:32.120
Why does it keep hurting?

1110
00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:34.319
(While everyone's laughing, this person is nervous.)

1111
00:45:34.319 --> 00:45:37.060
- You can endure it though. - Ready.

1112
00:45:37.589 --> 00:45:38.730
- Let's do this. - Let's hurry.

1113
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.629
Sang Yun's hair can be twisted.

1114
00:45:41.259 --> 00:45:42.299
Ready.

1115
00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:44.230
Start.

1116
00:45:44.739 --> 00:45:46.140
He's...

1117
00:45:46.669 --> 00:45:47.799
He'll totally tolerate the pain.

1118
00:45:47.799 --> 00:45:48.870
(I bet he'll tolerate it.)

1119
00:45:49.009 --> 00:45:50.609
- He'll totally tolerate the pain. - Ready, go.

1120
00:45:50.609 --> 00:45:53.279
- 1, 2, 3... - 1, 2, 3...

1121
00:45:53.279 --> 00:45:55.049
- How is he tolerating the pain? - Four...

1122
00:45:55.049 --> 00:45:57.580
- 1, 2, 3... - 1, 2, 3...

1123
00:45:57.580 --> 00:45:59.049
- How is he tolerating the pain? - Four...

1124
00:45:59.149 --> 00:46:00.850
5, 6.

1125
00:46:00.850 --> 00:46:02.819
He tolerated it to the point that his face turned red.

1126
00:46:02.819 --> 00:46:04.189
He's so determined.

1127
00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:06.819
(He really scares me.)

1128
00:46:06.819 --> 00:46:08.060
How can he do that?

1129
00:46:08.759 --> 00:46:11.430
It almost looked like he couldn't feel any emotions.

1130
00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:12.430
(Sang Yun succeeded too.)

1131
00:46:12.799 --> 00:46:15.370
(In order to win the master's treasure,)

1132
00:46:15.899 --> 00:46:19.040
(these two guys tolerated the extreme pain.)

1133
00:46:19.839 --> 00:46:22.270
Since the two of them succeeded, they should have a showdown.

1134
00:46:22.270 --> 00:46:23.939
- Hold hands. - Then...

1135
00:46:23.939 --> 00:46:25.410
(Now, it's Sang Yun versus Seung Gi.)

1136
00:46:25.410 --> 00:46:27.180
I'll give you an object that I really treasure a lot,

1137
00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:29.879
- so try to tolerate it again. - I can really do it.

1138
00:46:29.879 --> 00:46:32.220
I think I'm most likely to tolerate it and win.

1139
00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:35.089
But I'm... It's mine. I know it because it's meant to be mine.

1140
00:46:35.089 --> 00:46:36.089
(It's destined to be mine.)

1141
00:46:36.089 --> 00:46:38.049
I told you I could picture it as soon as I heard about it.

1142
00:46:38.049 --> 00:46:39.459
You can't beat someone like him.

1143
00:46:40.359 --> 00:46:41.489
I could just picture it.

1144
00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:44.560
- I'm even more scared of him now. - It's already in my heart.

1145
00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:46.259
Can I give up? I'm so scared of him.

1146
00:46:46.259 --> 00:46:47.500
- Let's... - Sang Yun.

1147
00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:50.000
Your eyes look so scary. They're emotionless now.

1148
00:46:50.799 --> 00:46:52.370
Right now, your eyes are devoid of emotions.

1149
00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:54.200
You look like you want to rip my ear off.

1150
00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:56.669
You have to play it fair and square, okay?

1151
00:46:57.270 --> 00:46:59.580
Get ready. Are you guys ready?

1152
00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:01.080
(A match between a human and a cyborg)

1153
00:47:02.049 --> 00:47:04.750
(Who will be the winner?)

1154
00:47:04.750 --> 00:47:06.919
Ready, go!

1155
00:47:09.790 --> 00:47:11.589
(The burning desire for the treasure...)

1156
00:47:11.589 --> 00:47:13.759
(is making them pinch so hard.)

1157
00:47:15.359 --> 00:47:16.560
(Pinching)

1158
00:47:21.569 --> 00:47:23.270
(Even the spectators...)

1159
00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:25.270
(can feel the pain because of the intensity of the tension.)

1160
00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:28.810
(Pinching as hard as he can)

1161
00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:34.239
(Neither of them is willing to give up!)

1162
00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:36.549
Hold on a second. I pulled his hair out.

1163
00:47:36.549 --> 00:47:37.580
(I pulled his hair out!)

1164
00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:40.180
(I pulled his hair out!)

1165
00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:43.750
I pulled his hair out, and he tolerated the pain.

1166
00:47:44.049 --> 00:47:46.319
(It's a lot of hair.)

1167
00:47:46.319 --> 00:47:47.919
Hold on a second. I pulled his hair out.

1168
00:47:47.919 --> 00:47:50.730
(That's how hard he pinched.)

1169
00:47:50.730 --> 00:47:53.060
(I can't believe he tolerated it!)

1170
00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:54.230
Look at this.

1171
00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:55.470
Gosh, that's...

1172
00:47:55.470 --> 00:47:57.500
I actually pulled his hair out. Look at this.

1173
00:47:57.830 --> 00:47:59.200
- But I didn't... - That's not fair.

1174
00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:01.169
I get that you want to win, but you can't do that.

1175
00:48:01.169 --> 00:48:03.509
No, I totally thought that he'd scream...

1176
00:48:03.509 --> 00:48:06.109
and that we'd stop, but he kept on tolerating it.

1177
00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:08.850
- It didn't hurt at all. - What are you talking about?

1178
00:48:08.850 --> 00:48:10.850
I want to give up.

1179
00:48:10.850 --> 00:48:12.279
- No, you should... - He scares me so much.

1180
00:48:12.279 --> 00:48:13.450
- You have to do it. - I'm scared.

1181
00:48:13.450 --> 00:48:16.089
I'm really scared. I mean it.

1182
00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:18.089
The skin here is all red.

1183
00:48:18.089 --> 00:48:19.120
(Seung Gi's skin turned red too.)

1184
00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:21.489
- You're also... - Se Hyeong, I pulled his hair out.

1185
00:48:21.489 --> 00:48:24.589
He got seven strands of hair pulled out, but he didn't even budge.

1186
00:48:24.689 --> 00:48:26.129
How am I supposed to beat him?

1187
00:48:26.129 --> 00:48:27.730
(Why don't I feel anything?)

1188
00:48:27.730 --> 00:48:29.600
Even I could hear it, but he tolerated the pain.

1189
00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:30.930
(Sang Yun must really be a cyborg.)

1190
00:48:30.930 --> 00:48:32.500
- I was so surprised. - It's all white here.

1191
00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:34.000
It really didn't hurt though.

1192
00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:35.640
- Gosh, you're... - I've finally found it.

1193
00:48:35.839 --> 00:48:37.239
- Found what? - What I'm good at.

1194
00:48:37.239 --> 00:48:38.680
- You don't feel anything here? - No.

1195
00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:39.839
I must be strong here.

1196
00:48:39.839 --> 00:48:41.379
"Good" isn't the right word. You scare us.

1197
00:48:41.379 --> 00:48:42.480
I'm so scared.

1198
00:48:42.810 --> 00:48:44.279
Doesn't he frighten you?

1199
00:48:46.819 --> 00:48:49.750
(Taking care of the treasures)

1200
00:48:49.819 --> 00:48:51.350
- Let's go. - We enjoyed the food,

1201
00:48:51.350 --> 00:48:54.520
- It was very good. - so I'll show you the treasure.

1202
00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:55.629
(They're headed to his place.)

1203
00:48:55.759 --> 00:48:56.959
I'm getting the treasure.

1204
00:48:56.959 --> 00:48:59.160
- The treasure is here. - Yes.

1205
00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:01.259
Which one would it be?

1206
00:49:01.529 --> 00:49:02.730
Which one of these would it be?

1207
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:04.899
What if he gives you one of his gloves?

1208
00:49:04.970 --> 00:49:06.169
I think he will.

1209
00:49:06.370 --> 00:49:07.540
That would be amazing.

1210
00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:09.169
But he told us earlier...

1211
00:49:09.169 --> 00:49:11.779
that he used of those gloves when he was in the national team.

1212
00:49:11.779 --> 00:49:14.209
- It might actually be a glove. - The blue one.

1213
00:49:14.209 --> 00:49:16.450
(Nice! I'm so excited.)

1214
00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:18.080
If I were him, I wouldn't give it to anyone.

1215
00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:21.419
Are you going to keep standing there and guess?

1216
00:49:21.489 --> 00:49:22.750
- We want to know. - The treasure?

1217
00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:23.790
I think...

1218
00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:25.859
it could be...

1219
00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:29.259
You might give me one of your baseball gloves.

1220
00:49:29.290 --> 00:49:31.430
But that wouldn't be so meaningful because I have many gloves.

1221
00:49:32.629 --> 00:49:34.770
- Then... - Is it something more meaningful?

1222
00:49:35.129 --> 00:49:38.399
Do you think that it's even more valuable...

1223
00:49:38.399 --> 00:49:39.939
than your gloves up there?

1224
00:49:39.939 --> 00:49:42.040
It's very valuable and meaningful to me.

1225
00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:43.310
I say that because...

1226
00:49:43.310 --> 00:49:44.509
(What is this treasure of his?)

1227
00:49:44.509 --> 00:49:45.540
This treasure became mine...

1228
00:49:45.939 --> 00:49:48.310
when I was in the US. In the Seattle Mariners,

1229
00:49:48.310 --> 00:49:51.250
there's a very famous pitcher who's known as King Felix.

1230
00:49:51.250 --> 00:49:53.450
He treasures this object so much...

1231
00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:56.649
that he always carries it in an attache briefcase.

1232
00:49:56.649 --> 00:49:58.160
- Seriously? - What is it?

1233
00:49:58.419 --> 00:50:00.459
He carries it around in an attache briefcase?

1234
00:50:00.459 --> 00:50:03.930
So, do you treasure it as much as he does?

1235
00:50:03.930 --> 00:50:05.629
Yes, I do. But...

1236
00:50:05.899 --> 00:50:08.029
- I'll give it to Sang Yun. - Can you give it away like that?

1237
00:50:08.330 --> 00:50:10.129
I'll give it to him. I'll show it to you guys too.

1238
00:50:10.129 --> 00:50:11.299
(Sang Yun is over the moon.)

1239
00:50:11.299 --> 00:50:13.100
All right. Move over, please.

1240
00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:15.439
(The treasure is hidden somewhere in this room.)

1241
00:50:15.439 --> 00:50:16.640
Oh, boy.

1242
00:50:16.970 --> 00:50:20.239
(Is it somewhere near the desk?)

1243
00:50:20.239 --> 00:50:22.680
- Oh, it was under the desk. - All right. It's inside this thing.

1244
00:50:23.609 --> 00:50:25.779
(It's the treasure!)

1245
00:50:25.779 --> 00:50:27.549
Gosh, it wasn't here.

1246
00:50:28.350 --> 00:50:29.390
(What's inside the briefcase?)

1247
00:50:29.390 --> 00:50:30.850
I'll give you what's inside this briefcase.

1248
00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:33.560
- What is it? - Sang Yun worked very hard today.

1249
00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:34.759
What could it be?

1250
00:50:34.859 --> 00:50:36.089
All right.

1251
00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:39.100
(We're about to find out what the treasure is.)

1252
00:50:39.129 --> 00:50:41.730
Oh, my. Doesn't that sound instantly put you in a good mood?

1253
00:50:41.730 --> 00:50:44.529
What would a baseball player carry around in a briefcase?

1254
00:50:45.370 --> 00:50:46.439
What is it?

1255
00:50:52.180 --> 00:50:53.540
(Sang Yun gets a peek at it.)

1256
00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:54.640
What is it?

1257
00:50:56.109 --> 00:50:57.410
(We can't figure out what he's thinking.)

1258
00:50:57.410 --> 00:50:59.649
I don't think it's a ball or a glove.

1259
00:50:59.649 --> 00:51:01.319
It must be something else. That's probably why...

1260
00:51:01.319 --> 00:51:02.890
Sang Yun looks kind of puzzled.

1261
00:51:03.450 --> 00:51:08.129
Is it worth losing seven strands of hair?

1262
00:51:08.730 --> 00:51:10.489
I think it's worth more than that.

1263
00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:13.830
Show us. We're dying to know what it is.

1264
00:51:13.930 --> 00:51:16.299
- Really? Shall I show you guys? - Yes, please show us.

1265
00:51:19.470 --> 00:51:23.109
(Sang Yun lost 7 strands of hair...)

1266
00:51:23.169 --> 00:51:26.180
(to win this object that the master absolutely treasures.)

1267
00:51:27.509 --> 00:51:28.580
(Expensive whiskey?)

1268
00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:30.379
That's liquor. By any chance, is it...

1269
00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:33.620
- This is... - Master's name is written on it.

1270
00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:35.549
- It's just liquor, - Right.

1271
00:51:35.549 --> 00:51:37.649
but it's for my retirement.

1272
00:51:37.689 --> 00:51:38.720
(It's for the day he retires.)

1273
00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:41.430
I want to share it with those who are dearest to me...

1274
00:51:41.430 --> 00:51:44.129
and whom I appreciate so much on the day that I retire.

1275
00:51:44.129 --> 00:51:46.299
That's why I've been collecting this whiskey.

1276
00:51:46.299 --> 00:51:47.299
(He'll share it with his dearest.)

1277
00:51:47.299 --> 00:51:49.629
I've been collecting it for two years now.

1278
00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:53.200
King Felix used to carry 3 or 4 bottles of this...

1279
00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:55.540
in a briefcase all the time.

1280
00:51:56.310 --> 00:51:58.910
When I saw that, I thought,

1281
00:51:58.910 --> 00:52:00.540
"Shall I collect it too?"

1282
00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:02.080
(Shall I collect a bottle every year?)

1283
00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:04.209
Frankly, I want to drink this now.

1284
00:52:04.209 --> 00:52:06.549
Even back then, I really wanted to drink it. But when I got the bottle,

1285
00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:09.250
I told myself that I'll drink it on the day that I retire.

1286
00:52:09.250 --> 00:52:10.790
I keep telling myself that.

1287
00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:12.560
(I'll give it to myself as a gift when I retire.)

1288
00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:15.089
I have to wait one more year to collect another bottle of this.

1289
00:52:15.359 --> 00:52:17.459
But I'll give it to you because I promised you.

1290
00:52:17.459 --> 00:52:18.560
(It's a symbol of patience.)

1291
00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:19.700
Thank you.

1292
00:52:20.730 --> 00:52:23.569
It could function as an invitation...

1293
00:52:23.569 --> 00:52:25.640
- to his retirement party. - That's right.

1294
00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:27.770
- Yes, you're right. - It's like an invitation.

1295
00:52:28.239 --> 00:52:30.339
I'll invite you.

1296
00:52:30.339 --> 00:52:32.009
You should bring it. I'll collect more for you guys too.

1297
00:52:32.939 --> 00:52:35.850
I'll treat you guys.

1298
00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:37.250
I'll totally be there.

1299
00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:39.450
All right. We should go to bed now.

1300
00:52:39.819 --> 00:52:41.549
Sang Yun, let's go.

1301
00:52:41.549 --> 00:52:42.689
Good night, Sang Yun.

1302
00:52:42.689 --> 00:52:44.350
- Good night. - Have a good sleep.

1303
00:52:44.350 --> 00:52:45.989
Gosh, we can finally sleep now.

1304
00:52:45.989 --> 00:52:49.930
(Their long, hard day with the master is finally over.)

1305
00:52:50.290 --> 00:52:53.129
(What kind of intense training would be waiting for them tomorrow?)

1306
00:52:53.129 --> 00:52:55.000
All right, sleep tight.

1307
00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.399
Good night, Sang Yun.

1308
00:52:57.500 --> 00:53:01.439
To tell you the truth, spending time with you today...

1309
00:53:01.810 --> 00:53:06.410
totally changed my perception of marriage.

1310
00:53:06.509 --> 00:53:09.149
I learned how important it is.

1311
00:53:09.149 --> 00:53:13.279
Shall I say it can motivate you to keep going like nothing else does?

1312
00:53:13.879 --> 00:53:17.189
Having a fan and an ally you can always count on...

1313
00:53:17.189 --> 00:53:18.689
makes you incredibly happy.

1314
00:53:21.290 --> 00:53:22.830
It was such a long day.

1315
00:53:23.189 --> 00:53:25.799
(Everything they did today was so intense.)

1316
00:53:25.799 --> 00:53:29.169
(The master's battle continues.)

1317
00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:33.669
(Current time, 7am)

1318
00:53:38.439 --> 00:53:39.910
It's time to wake up.

1319
00:53:42.709 --> 00:53:44.450
We must race against time.

1320
00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:49.649
(Come again?)

1321
00:53:51.350 --> 00:53:54.020
- Did you have a good sleep, Master? - Yes.

1322
00:53:56.489 --> 00:53:59.529
You guys must feel sore all over.

1323
00:53:59.529 --> 00:54:02.069
(We have to fight again at this early hour?)

1324
00:54:04.669 --> 00:54:06.870
(They fought against the mountain yesterday morning.)

1325
00:54:08.609 --> 00:54:12.779
(In the afternoon, they had to fight against Chul Soo.)

1326
00:54:14.580 --> 00:54:18.350
(Then at night, they fought against hunger.)

1327
00:54:20.419 --> 00:54:23.649
(Now, we have to race against time?)

1328
00:54:25.689 --> 00:54:28.230
(Gosh, my entire body aches.)

1329
00:54:30.089 --> 00:54:32.830
- Are you all right? - I slept throughout the night.

1330
00:54:32.859 --> 00:54:34.560
- You do look well rested. - Yes.

1331
00:54:35.470 --> 00:54:38.239
- I conked out right away. - I know. I passed out too.

1332
00:54:38.770 --> 00:54:39.770
I didn't even have any dreams.

1333
00:54:39.770 --> 00:54:41.069
(Thanks to the master, they slept like a baby.)

1334
00:54:42.410 --> 00:54:45.009
(Sang Yun just woke up too.)

1335
00:54:50.910 --> 00:54:53.350
(Who are you?)

1336
00:54:55.350 --> 00:54:57.450
(He bows to the master's wife.)

1337
00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:01.660
Did you have a good sleep?

1338
00:55:01.930 --> 00:55:03.560
Wasn't it uncomfortable at all?

1339
00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:05.660
No, I slept so well. I slept like a baby.

1340
00:55:05.660 --> 00:55:07.100
(We can't even look at him.)

1341
00:55:08.270 --> 00:55:10.930
(In TV dramas, he looks handsome even when he wakes up.)

1342
00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:17.470
(This is what happens in real life.)

1343
00:55:22.750 --> 00:55:24.149
Hyo Rin.

1344
00:55:26.779 --> 00:55:29.620
Seong Jae, we have to wake Hyo Rin up. Hyo Rin, time to wake up.

1345
00:55:29.620 --> 00:55:32.859
(The first thing the master does every morning is waking Hyo Rin up.)

1346
00:55:34.589 --> 00:55:35.689
Did you have a good sleep?

1347
00:55:36.989 --> 00:55:38.830
Gosh, Hyo Rin can't wake up.

1348
00:55:38.830 --> 00:55:40.529
She's walking, but she's still asleep.

1349
00:55:40.799 --> 00:55:42.870
- Hyo Rin, open your eyes. - She's walking.

1350
00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:43.930
(She's half asleep.)

1351
00:55:43.930 --> 00:55:45.200
Hyo Rin, open your eyes.

1352
00:55:45.540 --> 00:55:47.299
- Good morning, Hyo Rin. - Help her get ready.

1353
00:55:47.299 --> 00:55:49.870
- Good morning. - The three of you, hurry up.

1354
00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:53.640
(Hard labor, racing against time)

1355
00:55:54.140 --> 00:55:56.450
(It'll be harder than any training they've received.)

1356
00:55:56.450 --> 00:55:59.980
(They have to help Hyo Rin get ready for kindergarten on time.)

1357
00:55:59.980 --> 00:56:01.589
(They'll help her wash up,)

1358
00:56:01.589 --> 00:56:02.890
(get dressed,)

1359
00:56:02.890 --> 00:56:04.720
(and tie her hair.)

1360
00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:06.259
(She must get on the bus...)

1361
00:56:06.259 --> 00:56:08.359
(at 8:40am.)

1362
00:56:08.359 --> 00:56:10.089
(My gosh, are you serious?)

1363
00:56:11.129 --> 00:56:15.169
(That's a normal morning for the master as he has two kids.)

1364
00:56:15.700 --> 00:56:17.069
How should I help her wash up?

1365
00:56:17.169 --> 00:56:20.069
- I've never done this before. - She has to wash her face.

1366
00:56:20.069 --> 00:56:22.370
Seong Jae, you should do it since you're young.

1367
00:56:22.370 --> 00:56:23.970
(Seung Gi is making Seong Jae do it.)

1368
00:56:24.169 --> 00:56:25.879
- What should we do first? - Hurry up, you three.

1369
00:56:25.879 --> 00:56:26.879
- Hey. - Wash her face first?

1370
00:56:26.879 --> 00:56:28.040
- Hyo Rin. - Yes, help her wash her face.

1371
00:56:28.350 --> 00:56:29.350
Shall we wash your face?

1372
00:56:29.350 --> 00:56:31.720
(While the bachelors are confused and lost)

1373
00:56:33.419 --> 00:56:34.480
(Running away)

1374
00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:36.390
- Daddy? - Hyo Rin, where are you going?

1375
00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:38.520
- To her dad. - Daddy?

1376
00:56:39.390 --> 00:56:41.730
I'm impressed that they woke up without throwing a fit.

1377
00:56:42.689 --> 00:56:44.230
You must be tired.

1378
00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:45.560
(This fight won't be easy.)

1379
00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:46.730
She can't wake up.

1380
00:56:48.899 --> 00:56:51.069
(They don't know what to do.)

1381
00:56:51.069 --> 00:56:53.339
Ye Seung, you can go back to sleep.

1382
00:56:53.339 --> 00:56:55.370
- Come here. - Go to Uncle Seung Gi.

1383
00:56:55.470 --> 00:56:57.069
Come here, Ye Seung.

1384
00:56:58.980 --> 00:57:00.439
Hyo Rin, you need to wake up.

1385
00:57:00.439 --> 00:57:02.080
You have to go to kindergarten.

1386
00:57:02.250 --> 00:57:03.350
- Sleep. - Wake up already.

1387
00:57:05.379 --> 00:57:07.549
(Why is Seung Gi so good with kids?)

1388
00:57:07.549 --> 00:57:10.520
You have sleep in your eyes. The uncles will wash your face for you.

1389
00:57:12.290 --> 00:57:13.620
(Will we be able to do it?)

1390
00:57:13.620 --> 00:57:14.759
You want Uncle Seung Gi to do it?

1391
00:57:15.790 --> 00:57:16.790
Do you want that?

1392
00:57:16.790 --> 00:57:19.330
(I have to do something!)

1393
00:57:19.330 --> 00:57:21.629
(He's busy looking something up on the internet.)

1394
00:57:25.069 --> 00:57:26.069
Hold on a second.

1395
00:57:26.069 --> 00:57:28.870
(Seung Gi came up with an idea.)

1396
00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:33.509
- She wants to laze around more. - You have to wake up.

1397
00:57:33.509 --> 00:57:36.080
- Music will definitely wake her up. - You lied down again.

1398
00:57:36.649 --> 00:57:38.279
(Will it really work?)

1399
00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:39.720
You have to go to kindergarten.

1400
00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:41.689
- Come on! - Ye Seung, get up and dance.

1401
00:57:42.020 --> 00:57:44.649
(I love this song.)

1402
00:57:44.919 --> 00:57:47.060
- All right. Just lie down. - Show us your dance.

1403
00:57:47.459 --> 00:57:49.189
- Just lie down, Hyo Rin. - Lie down.

1404
00:57:49.529 --> 00:57:50.930
- My gosh. - I'll wake you up.

1405
00:57:51.129 --> 00:57:53.230
- He'll wake you up. - Here we go.

1406
00:57:53.230 --> 00:57:54.430
(Uncle Seung Gi's club is open.)

1407
00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:57.730
1, 2, 3, 4.

1408
00:57:57.730 --> 00:57:59.870
(She's not even moving.)

1409
00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:03.810
(Then I'll do acupressure on you to wake you up.)

1410
00:58:04.009 --> 00:58:06.680
- Hyo Rin, wake up already. - You should go wash your face.

1411
00:58:06.980 --> 00:58:08.980
- Get up already. - Wake up.

1412
00:58:08.980 --> 00:58:11.109
That will help you get taller.

1413
00:58:11.350 --> 00:58:13.649
Let's go wash your face, Hyo Rin. Come on.

1414
00:58:14.890 --> 00:58:17.319
- Let's go. - Just take her.

1415
00:58:17.489 --> 00:58:20.160
(He's making her stretch her arms.)

1416
00:58:21.859 --> 00:58:23.759
(My, this feels nice.)

1417
00:58:24.689 --> 00:58:25.759
Go wash your face.

1418
00:58:26.060 --> 00:58:27.299
- Come on. - 1, 2.

1419
00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:31.029
Hyo Rin, come on. We don't have time, Hyo Rin.

1420
00:58:31.330 --> 00:58:32.370
1, 2, 3. Go.

1421
00:58:32.569 --> 00:58:33.569
(40 minutes before she has to leave)

1422
00:58:33.569 --> 00:58:34.600
Hyo Rin, let's go wash up.

1423
00:58:34.970 --> 00:58:36.770
- Go on. - You'll stay like that?

1424
00:58:37.540 --> 00:58:40.009
(It's so hard to make her wash her face.)

1425
00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:44.709
(Se Hyeong is making Ye Seung's breakfast.)

1426
00:58:54.390 --> 00:58:56.560
This is harder than the workout yesterday.

1427
00:58:59.129 --> 00:59:01.060
(Give me food. I'm dizzy because I'm hungry.)

1428
00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:02.299
Ye Seung, here.

1429
00:59:02.430 --> 00:59:04.669
Let's eat. Open your mouth.

1430
00:59:08.169 --> 00:59:09.439
(Open your mouth.)

1431
00:59:09.439 --> 00:59:10.569
(It's delicious.)

1432
00:59:10.569 --> 00:59:12.739
- Why did you eat that? - What?

1433
00:59:12.739 --> 00:59:14.439
That was so smooth. That's not for you.

1434
00:59:14.509 --> 00:59:16.549
He wasn't really eating. Here, Ye Seung.

1435
00:59:17.350 --> 00:59:18.680
(He's eating well.)

1436
00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:19.919
One for you, Ye Seung.

1437
00:59:20.149 --> 00:59:23.020
Give me one too. Here. I want one too.

1438
00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:24.620
Give one to Uncle Seung Gi.

1439
00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:25.989
(This is such a happy moment.)

1440
00:59:25.989 --> 00:59:27.089
It's so good.

1441
00:59:27.089 --> 00:59:30.629
You guys will be doomed if you don't finish everything on time.

1442
00:59:30.629 --> 00:59:32.730
(They must race against time.)

1443
00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:35.330
- I'll make you exercise all day. - We're running out of time.

1444
00:59:35.870 --> 00:59:37.669
We only have 18 minutes now. My goodness.

1445
00:59:38.339 --> 00:59:39.600
Hurry up.

1446
00:59:40.770 --> 00:59:44.239
(Uncle Seong Jae is taking his sweet time with Hyo Rin.)

1447
00:59:44.410 --> 00:59:45.609
Brush your teeth up and down like this.

1448
00:59:45.609 --> 00:59:46.739
We only have 15 minutes now.

1449
00:59:47.140 --> 00:59:48.850
Like this. Gosh.

1450
00:59:49.149 --> 00:59:50.350
Done. We're done.

1451
00:59:50.350 --> 00:59:51.549
(He ends it hurriedly.)

1452
00:59:51.549 --> 00:59:52.649
We only have 15 minutes.

1453
00:59:53.049 --> 00:59:55.720
- Hurry up. - Okay. Spit it out like this.

1454
00:59:56.189 --> 00:59:57.290
Spit it out.

1455
00:59:57.290 --> 01:00:00.290
(15 minutes before she has to leave)

1456
01:00:01.089 --> 01:00:02.629
(Racing against time)

1457
01:00:02.629 --> 01:00:05.730
(Helping Hyo Rin wash up, done)

1458
01:00:06.859 --> 01:00:08.069
Gosh, it's so hectic.

1459
01:00:09.799 --> 01:00:11.799
(He's frazzled because he's in such a rush.)

1460
01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:13.970
(13 minutes before she has to leave)

1461
01:00:13.970 --> 01:00:16.509
See? You guys keep getting busier. Get moving.

1462
01:00:16.810 --> 01:00:17.939
Shall I help you get dressed?

1463
01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:20.180
- Pants first. - Let's put these pants on you.

1464
01:00:20.879 --> 01:00:21.980
Hyo Rin, I'll help you put this on.

1465
01:00:23.350 --> 01:00:24.379
Good girl.

1466
01:00:27.149 --> 01:00:29.790
(Was getting dressed this challenging?)

1467
01:00:29.989 --> 01:00:31.419
- I've never done this before. - Hyo Rin.

1468
01:00:31.989 --> 01:00:34.359
(Sang Yun was struggling, so the whole family came to his rescue.)

1469
01:00:34.359 --> 01:00:35.529
This first, right?

1470
01:00:35.589 --> 01:00:37.689
Yes. Let's see, Hyo Rin.

1471
01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:40.459
- Come here. - Do a turn for us.

1472
01:00:40.459 --> 01:00:41.569
Turn around.

1473
01:00:42.629 --> 01:00:44.270
Oh, my.

1474
01:00:44.270 --> 01:00:46.000
(A moment of bliss on their busy morning)

1475
01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.169
Now, we have to brush her hair for her.

1476
01:00:48.439 --> 01:00:49.609
It's time to do your hair.

1477
01:00:49.609 --> 01:00:51.339
- Hyo Rin's hair... - Come here.

1478
01:00:51.370 --> 01:00:52.580
Hyo Rin, why are you so pretty?

1479
01:00:52.879 --> 01:00:54.239
This will be very challenging.

1480
01:00:54.239 --> 01:00:55.609
Hyo Rin, Uncle will tie your hair for you.

1481
01:00:56.250 --> 01:01:00.379
(10 minutes before she has to leave)

1482
01:01:00.379 --> 01:01:01.589
What classes do you have today?

1483
01:01:01.589 --> 01:01:02.649
(9 minutes before she has to leave)

1484
01:01:02.649 --> 01:01:04.649
Art? Right, you have your art class today.

1485
01:01:04.649 --> 01:01:05.759
(He's trying the best.)

1486
01:01:06.419 --> 01:01:07.459
What else?

1487
01:01:08.189 --> 01:01:09.290
Gosh, we have no time.

1488
01:01:09.290 --> 01:01:11.500
Sang Yun, she'll miss her class today. Sang Yun!

1489
01:01:11.799 --> 01:01:14.359
Hurry up already. Seung Gi, you should give it a try.

1490
01:01:14.399 --> 01:01:16.430
- I'm scared of hurting her. - I know, right?

1491
01:01:16.430 --> 01:01:18.799
(They've never raised a kid.)

1492
01:01:19.669 --> 01:01:20.770
Yes, that's good.

1493
01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:27.580
(8 minutes before she has to leave)

1494
01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:30.379
Tell all your friends that your handsome uncles did your hair today.

1495
01:01:30.379 --> 01:01:31.779
(7 minutes before she has to leave)

1496
01:01:32.350 --> 01:01:34.890
- No. - No, right?

1497
01:01:37.049 --> 01:01:38.160
What's wrong?

1498
01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:39.890
(What happened to her hair?)

1499
01:01:40.989 --> 01:01:41.989
What's wrong?

1500
01:01:44.799 --> 01:01:47.000
- It's on the side. - What is this?

1501
01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:48.730
(Is that a horn or what?)

1502
01:01:49.370 --> 01:01:52.069
You should fix it quickly. We can't send her like this.

1503
01:01:52.069 --> 01:01:53.669
- No, don't. - I haven't even touched it.

1504
01:01:53.669 --> 01:01:55.739
- I'm Elsa. - Let Mommy fix it quicky.

1505
01:01:55.739 --> 01:01:56.870
(The latest hair trend among kids)

1506
01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:58.080
- Mommy will... - You're Elsa?

1507
01:01:58.080 --> 01:01:59.609
This hairstyle is popular these days.

1508
01:01:59.609 --> 01:02:00.779
- This? - A side ponytail.

1509
01:02:00.779 --> 01:02:02.980
It's coming undone. You can't leave like this.

1510
01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:04.709
Seung Gi, look at this ponytail.

1511
01:02:04.919 --> 01:02:07.080
- This is what Seong Jae did. - I can't do it.

1512
01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:08.919
- Fix it quickly. - It's so hard.

1513
01:02:08.919 --> 01:02:10.089
It's really hard.

1514
01:02:10.089 --> 01:02:15.930
(6 minutes before she has to leave)

1515
01:02:16.259 --> 01:02:17.359
Look at this.

1516
01:02:17.859 --> 01:02:19.230
That was so fast.

1517
01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:22.770
- It's fixed now. - Moms are amazing.

1518
01:02:23.529 --> 01:02:25.669
We should get changed quickly too.

1519
01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:27.169
Wash up quickly.

1520
01:02:27.169 --> 01:02:29.439
(5 minutes before she has to leave)

1521
01:02:29.970 --> 01:02:31.779
We only have five minutes. We need to hurry.

1522
01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:34.180
All right, guys. Five minutes before the bus arrives.

1523
01:02:34.439 --> 01:02:35.580
We only have five minutes!

1524
01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:37.250
(4 minutes before the bus arrives)

1525
01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:39.779
We'll be in trouble if she misses the bus, right?

1526
01:02:39.779 --> 01:02:41.020
We're actually fighting against time.

1527
01:02:41.350 --> 01:02:44.390
(1 minute before the bus arrives)

1528
01:02:44.759 --> 01:02:46.989
- The bus is here. - We accomplished our mission.

1529
01:02:46.989 --> 01:02:50.330
- 1, 2, 3. - We won against time.

1530
01:02:50.529 --> 01:02:52.759
- Bye, Hyo Rin. - Bye.

1531
01:02:52.959 --> 01:02:54.100
See you again soon!

1532
01:02:55.870 --> 01:02:58.470
(Hyo Rin left on time.)

1533
01:02:58.470 --> 01:03:00.370
- My gosh, we did it. - Good work, everyone.

1534
01:03:00.370 --> 01:03:02.339
We should get going now.

1535
01:03:04.540 --> 01:03:06.439
- Goodbye. - We're going to a meaningful place.

1536
01:03:06.439 --> 01:03:08.250
I prepared something meaningful for you guys.

1537
01:03:08.250 --> 01:03:09.580
- Again? - Something else that's meaningful.

1538
01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:12.020
- I think we've had enough. - Are we not getting breakfast?

1539
01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:14.850
In Kwon only fed us rice crust, and this time, we're getting no food.

1540
01:03:16.049 --> 01:03:19.089
(Another getaway with the master)

1541
01:03:19.089 --> 01:03:22.290
(Like Haeundae and seagulls, this place is one of...)

1542
01:03:22.290 --> 01:03:24.859
(the first things that come to our mind when we think of Busan.)

1543
01:03:24.859 --> 01:03:27.129
(Busan Sajik Baseball Stadium)

1544
01:03:28.169 --> 01:03:31.569
(It's time to check out the master's baseball skills...)

1545
01:03:31.569 --> 01:03:34.270
(at this passion-filled stadium.)

1546
01:03:35.839 --> 01:03:37.810
This is close to the left fielder's position.

1547
01:03:37.810 --> 01:03:39.109
- Where? - The left fielder.

1548
01:03:39.109 --> 01:03:40.410
- It's behind the left fielder. - I see.

1549
01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:42.580
The ball flew over and fell here.

1550
01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:44.379
(The trace of the master's out-of-the-park homer)

1551
01:03:44.379 --> 01:03:46.919
- There? Right over there? - The first out-of-the-park homer.

1552
01:03:46.919 --> 01:03:48.520
- My, they made this for you. - Incredible.

1553
01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:50.390
This... Master, you did this?

1554
01:03:50.390 --> 01:03:52.259
- It's so cool. - How did it come this far?

1555
01:03:52.259 --> 01:03:53.390
That's why I'm showing you guys.

1556
01:03:53.759 --> 01:03:56.029
My gosh, this is... I thought...

1557
01:03:56.029 --> 01:03:57.029
It's amazing.

1558
01:03:57.029 --> 01:03:58.560
(Hyundai Unicorns versus Lotte Giants in April 2007)

1559
01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:02.129
(He hit the ball against the pitcher, Chung Min Tae.)

(He hit the 1st out-of-the-park homer of Sajik Baseball Stadium.)

1563
01:04:09.609 --> 01:04:12.109
(In order to write a new history here,)

1564
01:04:12.109 --> 01:04:16.779
(he returned to Korea in 2017.)

1565
01:04:16.779 --> 01:04:18.080
(He refused various enticing offers...)

1566
01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:19.180
(and high salaries.)

1567
01:04:19.180 --> 01:04:20.879
I decided to come back here...

1568
01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:24.589
because I want to win here.

1569
01:04:24.919 --> 01:04:27.259
This is where I can make my dream come true.

1570
01:04:27.259 --> 01:04:28.930
That's all that matters to me.

1571
01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:30.790
I won in Japan too, but that's different.

1572
01:04:31.529 --> 01:04:35.129
You wanted to come back to the place where you grew up.

1573
01:04:35.129 --> 01:04:38.069
I wanted to come back when I'm still strong so that I can win.

1574
01:04:38.069 --> 01:04:39.899
(He wanted to return to his hometown and help the team win.)

1575
01:04:40.270 --> 01:04:42.709
I want to win. I really do.

1576
01:04:45.379 --> 01:04:46.379
(As they enter the stadium)

1577
01:04:46.379 --> 01:04:47.810
This is so cool. I'm...

1578
01:04:47.810 --> 01:04:49.250
We never get to see this view.

1579
01:04:49.779 --> 01:04:51.879
People never get to see this unless they're baseball players.

1580
01:04:53.350 --> 01:04:55.549
(What baseball players see at the Busan Sajik Baseball Stadium)

1581
01:04:55.549 --> 01:04:56.720
- Oh, my. - It's huge.

1582
01:04:57.350 --> 01:05:00.890
It's so quiet here now because all the seats are empty,

1583
01:05:00.890 --> 01:05:03.290
but when the season starts,

1584
01:05:03.290 --> 01:05:05.730
you hear people cheering in all directions.

1585
01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.799
As I mentioned earlier, I came back here to win.

1586
01:05:12.799 --> 01:05:16.069
If we win, I want to have all the fans come down...

1587
01:05:16.069 --> 01:05:18.379
so that we can drink together in the trophy.

1588
01:05:18.379 --> 01:05:19.379
That's my dream.

1589
01:05:20.609 --> 01:05:21.709
That's really all I want.

1590
01:05:22.509 --> 01:05:24.680
I think I'll cry my eyes out if we win.

1591
01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:26.149
I hate crying,

1592
01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:28.089
but I think I'll cry a lot.

1593
01:05:30.549 --> 01:05:32.919
Thinking about winning is making me all emotional.

1594
01:05:32.919 --> 01:05:34.089
Oh, really?

1595
01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:35.790
I really miss it.

1596
01:05:36.790 --> 01:05:39.129
Let's go. We'll try hitting the ball for a bit.

1597
01:05:39.230 --> 01:05:41.230
- Another out-of-the-park homer. - Seriously?

1598
01:05:41.470 --> 01:05:44.970
Oh, my. This is... This is real.

1599
01:05:44.970 --> 01:05:47.700
(The country's best cleanup hitter is here.)

1600
01:05:47.839 --> 01:05:50.169
- The bat is so... - How's he going to do it?

1601
01:05:50.169 --> 01:05:51.640
- Did you hear his bat? - It sounds different.

1602
01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:53.410
The bat. Can you hear the sound his bat is making?

1603
01:05:53.410 --> 01:05:55.480
- It's almost... - Record the sound.

1604
01:05:55.649 --> 01:05:56.810
Record the sound.

1605
01:05:56.810 --> 01:05:58.950
- The way he swings it... - The bat...

1606
01:05:58.950 --> 01:06:00.620
- makes this sound. - No, it's this sound.

1607
01:06:00.879 --> 01:06:02.290
(Seung Gi thinks it sounds like this.)

1608
01:06:02.290 --> 01:06:04.290
I even heard a pretty loud sound.

1609
01:06:04.290 --> 01:06:06.189
(Even just the sound intimidates them.)

1610
01:06:06.189 --> 01:06:07.890
Just throw it over like this.

1611
01:06:07.890 --> 01:06:09.459
Try to hit right here. Give it a shot.

1612
01:06:09.890 --> 01:06:11.899
- Good, that's it. One more time. - I can totally do this.

1613
01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:14.459
But will he be able to hit a home run like this?

1614
01:06:14.459 --> 01:06:16.700
It's not easy even for baseball players, right?

1615
01:06:16.700 --> 01:06:17.830
Of course, it's not easy.

1616
01:06:19.299 --> 01:06:20.870
(Will this...)

1617
01:06:20.870 --> 01:06:22.970
(really work?)

1618
01:06:23.169 --> 01:06:24.310
You can do it.

1619
01:06:27.009 --> 01:06:29.709
(Supported by his incredible lower body muscle strength,)

1620
01:06:29.709 --> 01:06:31.680
(he uses his flexibility to swing the bat.)

1621
01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:34.549
(This is the home run master's secret.)

1622
01:06:34.549 --> 01:06:35.750
It went all the way there.

1623
01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:37.120
(It fell right by the fence.)

1624
01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:39.589
(We can't believe we got to see it right before our eyes.)

1625
01:06:40.459 --> 01:06:41.859
It was too quick.

1626
01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:43.459
I didn't catch the ball.

1627
01:06:43.459 --> 01:06:44.489
(It was still close.)

1628
01:06:45.629 --> 01:06:47.100
(The 2nd attempt)

1629
01:06:47.100 --> 01:06:49.770
(Will it be a home run this time?)

1630
01:06:50.930 --> 01:06:52.799
- Did it go over? - Yes, it did.

1631
01:06:53.700 --> 01:06:55.439
- It went over. - I didn't hit it right on.

1632
01:06:55.439 --> 01:06:56.609
(He can tell right away.)

1633
01:06:56.609 --> 01:07:00.209
(It fell in front of the fence again.)

1634
01:07:00.980 --> 01:07:02.080
(It was so close.)

1635
01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:05.149
I can tell what will happen as soon as I hit the ball.

1636
01:07:05.149 --> 01:07:06.919
- Really? - Unbelievable.

1637
01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:09.819
It'll feel incredible when you hit the ball right on.

1638
01:07:09.850 --> 01:07:12.490
I think I'm close. I'll probably hit a home run within two attempts.

1639
01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:14.520
- All right, here I go. - Okay.

1640
01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:16.459
I should do it right away. Taking a break doesn't help.

1641
01:07:16.459 --> 01:07:17.459
(His pride is on the line.)

1642
01:07:17.459 --> 01:07:19.430
(They're so excited.)

1643
01:07:21.730 --> 01:07:23.100
- I did it! - Oh, my!

1644
01:07:24.770 --> 01:07:26.839
(He's certain of it.)

1645
01:07:26.839 --> 01:07:28.539
(That made everyone's jaw drop.)

1646
01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:34.749
(The ball soared as high as the master expected.)

1647
01:07:35.749 --> 01:07:39.549
(What's the result?)

1648
01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:50.789
(The master's endless training and perseverance...)

1649
01:07:50.789 --> 01:07:54.430
(are ultimately for hitting a home run like this.)

1650
01:07:54.430 --> 01:07:55.900
It's a home run!

1651
01:07:57.730 --> 01:07:59.669
You really did it. My gosh.

1652
01:07:59.770 --> 01:08:01.570
- It only took three attempts. - We did it.

1653
01:08:01.570 --> 01:08:03.570
I can now understand what it feels like...

1654
01:08:03.570 --> 01:08:05.079
- to hit a home run. - Home run!

1655
01:08:05.079 --> 01:08:06.509
We did it.

1656
01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:08.110
- Home run! - Yes!

1657
01:08:08.110 --> 01:08:10.549
- It's so gratifying. - I thought...

1658
01:08:11.150 --> 01:08:12.449
In three attempts. Wow.

1659
01:08:12.449 --> 01:08:14.419
- Hitting a home run feels amazing. - Seriously.

1660
01:08:15.549 --> 01:08:17.449
When else will I get to step on the mound?

1661
01:08:17.449 --> 01:08:21.730
(They think about what they learned from the blissful moment.)

1662
01:08:23.759 --> 01:08:25.699
I must say, Seong Jae looks confident today.

1663
01:08:25.699 --> 01:08:27.959
- He must've learned something big. - I'll impress you all today.

1664
01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:29.900
- I'll go first. - Okay.

1665
01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:31.999
(The lesson these curious young men learned in 1 sentence)

1666
01:08:33.470 --> 01:08:37.169
Men's strength comes from strong lower body muscles.

1667
01:08:37.310 --> 01:08:38.909
(Blushing)

1668
01:08:38.909 --> 01:08:40.810
And that power comes from...

1669
01:08:41.339 --> 01:08:42.709
the love for your family.

1670
01:08:42.709 --> 01:08:45.079
(A man's strength ultimately comes from his love for his family.)

1671
01:08:45.079 --> 01:08:48.249
It means that he's carrying the weight and balancing it.

1672
01:08:48.789 --> 01:08:51.390
- He's supporting his family. - Oh, right.

1673
01:08:51.490 --> 01:08:55.560
He can keep challenging himself and win the battles against himself...

1674
01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:58.430
because of his love for his family.

1675
01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:03.900
Personally, I could see how much he loves...

1676
01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:06.499
his wife and his two kids.

1677
01:09:09.839 --> 01:09:13.009
I could feel it so strongly.

1678
01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:17.850
To be honest, I came up with my one sentence so easily today.

1679
01:09:17.850 --> 01:09:19.020
(What did Se Hyeong learn?)

1680
01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:21.549
This is my one sentence. "Marry the one you love."

1681
01:09:21.549 --> 01:09:24.049
That's what resonated with me the most.

1682
01:09:24.049 --> 01:09:25.789
(Marry the one you love.)

1683
01:09:25.789 --> 01:09:28.659
Master. In the car yesterday, you told us about the time...

1684
01:09:28.659 --> 01:09:30.459
- when you and your wife dated. - Yes.

1685
01:09:30.829 --> 01:09:33.860
They say you can tell right away when you meet the one you'll marry.

1686
01:09:33.860 --> 01:09:35.329
- Right. - People say that all the time,

1687
01:09:35.470 --> 01:09:37.030
but I don't know how you can tell.

1688
01:09:37.129 --> 01:09:39.270
The doctor said the surgery would take about 2 to 3 hours,

1689
01:09:39.270 --> 01:09:41.440
but it ended up taking six hours.

1690
01:09:41.970 --> 01:09:43.709
She cried as soon as she saw me.

1691
01:09:43.810 --> 01:09:46.009
When I saw her crying,

1692
01:09:46.009 --> 01:09:48.009
I thought that I really want to make her happy.

1693
01:09:48.009 --> 01:09:49.850
- You wanted to make her happy? - Yes.

1694
01:09:49.980 --> 01:09:52.879
I thought I want to make sure she'll never have to cry again.

1695
01:09:53.820 --> 01:09:54.850
That's how I knew...

1696
01:09:54.850 --> 01:09:57.150
When I heard that, I thought, "I want to fall in love soon."

1697
01:09:57.150 --> 01:09:59.419
- Yes, totally. - And I want to get married soon.

1698
01:09:59.419 --> 01:10:01.560
That was the first thing I thought.

1699
01:10:01.860 --> 01:10:03.289
Work has been my priority,

1700
01:10:03.289 --> 01:10:05.560
so I wanted to get married at around 40,

1701
01:10:05.799 --> 01:10:08.999
- but my plan has totally changed... - I know what you mean.

1702
01:10:08.999 --> 01:10:11.799
because I realized that should be my focus now.

1703
01:10:12.539 --> 01:10:14.470
- That's great. - That's really...

1704
01:10:14.470 --> 01:10:15.709
That's a huge revelation.

1705
01:10:15.839 --> 01:10:20.379
Celebrities need a lot of courage to actually do that, you know.

1706
01:10:21.879 --> 01:10:23.180
That's so true.

1707
01:10:23.209 --> 01:10:25.020
Mustering up the courage to announce it.

1708
01:10:27.579 --> 01:10:29.119
I want you guys to be open about dating.

1709
01:10:29.119 --> 01:10:31.249
Falling in love and breaking up are nothing strange, you know.

1710
01:10:31.249 --> 01:10:35.190
- Right, of course. - But these days,

1711
01:10:35.190 --> 01:10:36.829
when celebrity couples break up,

1712
01:10:37.190 --> 01:10:39.060
only one party gets hurt.

1713
01:10:39.060 --> 01:10:40.060
(He keeps talking about celebrity couples.)

1714
01:10:40.060 --> 01:10:42.100
When people start posting all sorts of mean comments online...

1715
01:10:43.270 --> 01:10:46.640
- Are you talking about me now? - What?

1716
01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:47.740
Me? You know.

1717
01:10:47.740 --> 01:10:49.610
- Gosh, I wasn't talking about you. - Really?

1718
01:10:49.610 --> 01:10:53.209
- Then were you talking about me? - Was it about Sang Yun?

1719
01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:57.150
- Right, the two of you. - You kept looking this way.

1720
01:10:57.150 --> 01:10:58.350
No, I was just...

1721
01:10:58.419 --> 01:11:01.049
I wasn't talking about you guys. I was just explaining...

1722
01:11:01.049 --> 01:11:02.419
- I'm serious. - He was initially...

1723
01:11:02.419 --> 01:11:05.289
- Enough. We heard you. - Please forget what I said.

1724
01:11:05.289 --> 01:11:06.919
- I'm really sorry. - Okay, we heard you.

1725
01:11:06.919 --> 01:11:08.190
- I'm so sorry. - We already forgot about it.

1726
01:11:08.190 --> 01:11:09.959
- I apologize. - I said we already forgot about it.

1727
01:11:09.959 --> 01:11:12.799
I feel bad. I didn't mean it at all. You know, right? I'm sorry.

1728
01:11:12.799 --> 01:11:14.730
- I'm really sorry. - Sit down. Sit down already.

1729
01:11:14.730 --> 01:11:16.199
Sorry. I sincerely apologize.

1730
01:11:16.199 --> 01:11:17.770
- I had no idea. I didn't mean to... - Just sit down.

1731
01:11:17.770 --> 01:11:19.600
- I feel so bad. - Sit down already.

1732
01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:21.199
- Please accept my apology. - All right.

1733
01:11:21.199 --> 01:11:22.810
- Sorry. Sang Yun, I'm sorry. - All right.

1734
01:11:22.810 --> 01:11:24.470
- I'm really sorry. - It's okay.

1735
01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:26.280
This is the first time I'm seeing your face turn red.

1736
01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:30.110
I swear. I never intended to make fun of you guys or...

1737
01:11:30.110 --> 01:11:32.220
- Okay. I said I heard you. - I was just...

1738
01:11:32.220 --> 01:11:33.419
- I know that now, okay? - Today,

1739
01:11:33.419 --> 01:11:34.549
- I felt your sincerity. - we're here...

1740
01:11:34.549 --> 01:11:37.589
We're here to learn from the master, and like I said earlier,

1741
01:11:37.589 --> 01:11:39.959
I learned I should marry the one I love. That's why I brought it up.

1742
01:11:39.959 --> 01:11:41.890
- You guys got the wrong idea. - All right.

1743
01:11:41.890 --> 01:11:43.659
- I'm serious. - I must say,

1744
01:11:44.030 --> 01:11:45.530
I've only spent a day with you guys,

1745
01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:47.060
but I really hope the three of you...

1746
01:11:47.060 --> 01:11:49.199
meet the love of your life soon. I mean it.

1747
01:11:49.199 --> 01:11:53.070
Master, enough already. We heard you guys. Goodness.

1748
01:11:53.869 --> 01:11:55.369
- We heard you, Master. - All right.

1749
01:11:55.369 --> 01:11:57.240
- We've learned our lesson. - Okay.

1750
01:11:57.240 --> 01:11:58.810
Okay. Who's next?

1751
01:11:58.810 --> 01:12:01.879
What I learned is similar to what Sang Yun said.

1752
01:12:01.879 --> 01:12:03.310
(Seong Jae shares the lesson he learned.)

1753
01:12:04.249 --> 01:12:07.449
Salmon going against the current...

1754
01:12:07.449 --> 01:12:09.249
Kang San Ae.

1755
01:12:10.089 --> 01:12:11.249
(Bingo)

1756
01:12:11.249 --> 01:12:13.959
- Kang San Ae. - They can go against the current...

1757
01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:16.129
because they're not alone.

1758
01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:18.400
- That's the lesson you learned. - Impressive.

1759
01:12:18.829 --> 01:12:20.560
Does it mean Master is supported by people around him?

1760
01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:24.299
Yes, exactly. Salmon don't swim alone, you know.

1761
01:12:24.299 --> 01:12:25.669
They're not alone in the battle.

1762
01:12:25.669 --> 01:12:28.470
They have their comrades and families.

1763
01:12:28.909 --> 01:12:31.680
When he told us about his family...

1764
01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:33.780
and his teammates who are working hard with him towards the same goal,

1765
01:12:34.009 --> 01:12:36.009
I thought of salmon right away.

1766
01:12:36.009 --> 01:12:37.879
(The master's life reminded Seong Jae of salmon.)

1767
01:12:37.879 --> 01:12:39.280
You're very insightful.

1768
01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:43.119
- It's not easy to think of salmon. - Exactly.

1769
01:12:43.119 --> 01:12:46.490
As you all know, salmon return to where they were born...

1770
01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:48.589
- and die after spawning. - Right.

1771
01:12:48.589 --> 01:12:50.789
Just like that, I want to retire after winning.

1772
01:12:51.259 --> 01:12:53.199
That's right. That's exactly what I was trying to say.

1773
01:12:53.199 --> 01:12:54.230
- That's perfect. - That's what you meant.

1774
01:12:54.230 --> 01:12:55.369
That's just perfect.

1775
01:12:56.169 --> 01:12:57.699
Here's what I learned.

1776
01:12:57.699 --> 01:12:59.640
(Seung Gi shares what he learned.)

1777
01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:02.009
If we were to find another word for "pain",

1778
01:13:04.310 --> 01:13:05.539
it'd be "dream".

1779
01:13:05.539 --> 01:13:07.740
("Dream" is another word for "pain".)

1780
01:13:08.009 --> 01:13:09.150
You guys get it, right?

1781
01:13:09.150 --> 01:13:12.079
In other words, dream is what enables him to enjoy...

1782
01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:14.220
the endless pain.

1783
01:13:14.350 --> 01:13:15.820
If he keeps on going,

1784
01:13:15.850 --> 01:13:18.419
it may result in his team's victory as he mentioned earlier.

1785
01:13:18.659 --> 01:13:22.430
We must tolerate pain and persevere to make our dream come true.

1786
01:13:22.730 --> 01:13:24.860
- That's great. - Isn't it impressive?

1787
01:13:24.860 --> 01:13:27.159
- Master, what do you think? - My, that's really insightful.

1788
01:13:27.159 --> 01:13:28.930
"Pain" is another word for "dream".

1789
01:13:28.930 --> 01:13:30.369
What Seung Gi said is...

1790
01:13:30.369 --> 01:13:32.640
He basically expressed the essence of everything I've been doing...

1791
01:13:32.869 --> 01:13:34.740
in words.

1792
01:13:35.310 --> 01:13:38.509
I wish I heard it years ago.

1793
01:13:38.509 --> 01:13:41.140
The quote would've been my life motto.

1794
01:13:41.549 --> 01:13:43.350
- Is it that good? - It's perfect.

1795
01:13:43.350 --> 01:13:46.280
- Pain is another word for dream. - Dream.

1796
01:13:46.449 --> 01:13:48.490
Today, Seung Gi won.

1797
01:13:48.490 --> 01:13:49.789
Thank you, Master.

1798
01:13:50.549 --> 01:13:52.759
Yes! I did it!

1799
01:13:52.759 --> 01:13:54.119
(Who will be their next master?)

1800
01:13:54.789 --> 01:13:57.289
(On a field of snow,)

1801
01:13:57.289 --> 01:13:58.829
(these 4 guys are waiting for their master.)

1802
01:13:58.900 --> 01:14:00.530
(Master, the moment you came to me,)

1803
01:14:00.530 --> 01:14:02.369
(you became my flower.)

1804
01:14:02.369 --> 01:14:04.030
(I've never professed my feelings like this before.)

1805
01:14:04.270 --> 01:14:05.770
(The 4 men dream of...)

1806
01:14:05.770 --> 01:14:08.140
(a love story with the master.)

1807
01:14:09.310 --> 01:14:11.440
(A love story?)

1808
01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:14.110
(The master is too intimidating to love.)

1809
01:14:14.780 --> 01:14:17.680
(Even the extreme cold weather was tolerable,)

1810
01:14:18.180 --> 01:14:21.280
(but the master's love feels even colder than the weather.)

1811
01:14:21.690 --> 01:14:23.289
(Sang Yun is in pain.)

1812
01:14:23.890 --> 01:14:25.060
(It's so cold that it hurts.)

1813
01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:27.259
(The love story with the master)

1814
01:14:28.659 --> 01:14:31.730
The viewers would have no idea why I'm laughing now.

1815
01:14:32.759 --> 01:14:34.930
1, 2, 3.

1816
01:14:34.930 --> 01:14:37.600
(All the Butlers, The Master in Love Story)
