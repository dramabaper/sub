00:00:07.678 --> 00:00:09.478
(Episode 31)

2
00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:14.718
Chairman Park Sung Jin wasn't murdered by Chairman Hwang Do Won.

3
00:00:14.718 --> 00:00:15.718
It was Martin.

4
00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:19.388
A video of him confessing his crime...

5
00:00:20.088 --> 00:00:21.759
was recorded on Aji 3.

6
00:00:26.658 --> 00:00:28.568
I heard the emergency board meeting is tomorrow.

7
00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.669
- I think we should all go... - No.

8
00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.109
That won't solve anything.

9
00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:35.569
Then,

10
00:00:36.268 --> 00:00:37.808
do you have another idea?

11
00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:40.448
I'm going to make sure...

12
00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:44.119
they don't use my illness against me from now on.

13
00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:04.368
Are you going in?

14
00:01:13.708 --> 00:01:14.848
Have some.

15
00:01:15.449 --> 00:01:18.219
When you were young, I used to get this bread...

16
00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:21.288
for you and Min Kyu. You two loved it so much.

17
00:01:25.089 --> 00:01:26.318
You know about it too, don't you?

18
00:01:27.988 --> 00:01:29.189
I'm talking about Min Kyu.

19
00:01:30.628 --> 00:01:32.098
Do you know about his illness?

20
00:01:32.458 --> 00:01:34.398
Of course, I do.

21
00:01:34.669 --> 00:01:37.368
He suffered from the illness for 15 years.

22
00:01:39.068 --> 00:01:41.469
15 years?

23
00:01:41.908 --> 00:01:42.908
Yes.

24
00:01:44.339 --> 00:01:48.609
It started when both his parents passed away.

25
00:01:49.878 --> 00:01:52.878
It's probably because he got hurt...

26
00:01:52.878 --> 00:01:56.389
by a lot of people back then.

27
00:02:01.158 --> 00:02:02.628
Sign this.

28
00:02:02.928 --> 00:02:04.658
My dad told me that...

29
00:02:04.658 --> 00:02:07.829
we'll be able to live together if you sign this.

30
00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:19.778
Cheer up, my friend.

31
00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:22.979
No. We're a family now.

32
00:02:23.248 --> 00:02:26.879
What? What's this? Get away from me!

33
00:02:28.018 --> 00:02:29.389
What's this?

34
00:03:01.218 --> 00:03:04.088
(Purpose of Claim, Name of Guardian: Hwang Do Won)

35
00:03:10.188 --> 00:03:11.958
After that day,

36
00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:16.799
Min Kyu locked himself up in this house for 15 years.

37
00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.768
He couldn't have any physical contact with other people.

38
00:03:22.768 --> 00:03:25.409
He cooked his own food.

39
00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:27.808
And he just endured the pain.

40
00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.549
More importantly, no one came to visit him.

41
00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:36.789
Why didn't you visit him?

42
00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:41.159
I was sorry.

43
00:03:44.928 --> 00:03:49.428
If you're sorry, you need to say so in order for him to know.

44
00:04:17.058 --> 00:04:18.558
It's apparently because of me.

45
00:04:20.428 --> 00:04:22.669
Min Kyu got sick because of me.

46
00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:24.998
I used to feel really upset.

47
00:04:25.568 --> 00:04:28.138
I couldn't understand why he was so harsh on me.

48
00:04:28.638 --> 00:04:31.209
I couldn't understand how he could treat me that way...

49
00:04:33.109 --> 00:04:35.479
when we used to be friends.

50
00:04:37.248 --> 00:04:39.378
I thought I was the victim.

51
00:04:40.988 --> 00:04:42.818
And I slowly started to...

52
00:04:44.488 --> 00:04:45.888
rationalize me...

53
00:04:48.359 --> 00:04:50.159
and my dad's actions.

54
00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:55.128
You were young back then.

55
00:04:55.828 --> 00:04:59.138
You didn't know he had that kind of illness.

56
00:05:01.008 --> 00:05:03.169
I'm sure Min Kyu will understand.

57
00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:06.738
It's not too late. You can go back to being friends.

58
00:05:09.078 --> 00:05:11.649
Do you really think so?

59
00:05:41.748 --> 00:05:45.649
He probably can't sleep because of tomorrow's press conference.

60
00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:53.159
Hey, what's up?

61
00:05:55.258 --> 00:05:57.558
What? You're where?

62
00:06:07.068 --> 00:06:10.209
- When did you come? - Just a while ago.

63
00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:13.209
Are you okay?

64
00:06:24.558 --> 00:06:25.818
Friend Mode.

65
00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:32.359
Why the long face? Do you want me to make you smile?

66
00:06:32.928 --> 00:06:33.998
Who made you feel this way?

67
00:06:33.998 --> 00:06:36.498
Bring them over. I'll beat the soul out of them.

68
00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:43.438
My gosh, you're cute.

69
00:06:44.138 --> 00:06:46.979
You better not act this cute around others.

70
00:06:47.178 --> 00:06:49.709
You're the only person who thinks I'm cute.

71
00:06:49.709 --> 00:06:51.678
What? Why wouldn't anyone think you're cute?

72
00:06:51.678 --> 00:06:53.849
I know, right?

73
00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:56.988
You're the cutest and prettiest woman...

74
00:06:56.988 --> 00:06:59.789
out of all the women I know.

75
00:06:59.888 --> 00:07:01.928
You don't know a lot of women.

76
00:07:04.928 --> 00:07:07.969
Should I make some more female friends?

77
00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:09.529
I'm going to kill you.

78
00:07:13.769 --> 00:07:17.609
If I'm so cute, you can promote me and start calling me Pretty again.

79
00:07:17.609 --> 00:07:19.308
No, I can't do that.

80
00:07:19.308 --> 00:07:20.378
Why not?

81
00:07:20.378 --> 00:07:23.109
There's another rank right above that rank,

82
00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:24.349
and that's you.

83
00:07:24.818 --> 00:07:25.948
What kind of rank is that?

84
00:07:25.948 --> 00:07:29.219
It's a special rank that I made just for you who's full of secrets.

85
00:07:29.219 --> 00:07:31.618
Gosh, I told you everything. There's nothing more to tell.

86
00:07:31.618 --> 00:07:33.488
When? I'm sure there's more.

87
00:07:33.488 --> 00:07:34.558
- I already told you everything. - Do you...

88
00:07:34.558 --> 00:07:37.029
- want me to bring it up again? - You're so mean.

89
00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:38.659
- I know there's more. - There's nothing more to tell.

90
00:07:38.659 --> 00:07:41.368
- Gosh, just admit it. - Hey.

91
00:07:42.428 --> 00:07:44.039
You're driving me crazy.

92
00:07:53.808 --> 00:07:55.578
Do you feel better?

93
00:07:55.578 --> 00:07:56.609
Yes.

94
00:07:57.979 --> 00:08:01.789
Thanks to you, I'll be able to win the fight tomorrow.

95
00:08:03.988 --> 00:08:06.758
Are you sure you don't need me there?

96
00:08:07.328 --> 00:08:09.859
Do you want me to stand at the back of the conference room?

97
00:08:10.758 --> 00:08:13.868
No, it's okay. I'll go by myself.

98
00:08:15.368 --> 00:08:19.638
Wherever I may be, I know that you'll always be by my side.

99
00:08:26.279 --> 00:08:29.049
I wish you all the best.

100
00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:33.649
I'll do my best to win.

101
00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:45.659
We shall begin the emergency board meeting.

102
00:08:45.659 --> 00:08:50.269
We prepared today's agenda for KM Financial's future...

103
00:08:50.269 --> 00:08:53.198
in which the board has to come to a quick decision.

104
00:08:53.269 --> 00:08:54.438
Just a second.

105
00:08:55.608 --> 00:08:59.478
Let me say something before you announce the agenda.

106
00:09:00.208 --> 00:09:04.578
Director Kim is currently holding a press conference.

107
00:09:04.578 --> 00:09:08.119
It may have a big effect on today's meeting.

108
00:09:08.119 --> 00:09:11.919
Therefore, I think we should first check what he'll be announcing.

109
00:09:11.919 --> 00:09:13.928
What are you talking about? Let's just get on with it.

110
00:09:13.928 --> 00:09:17.259
But he might be announcing something really important.

111
00:09:17.259 --> 00:09:21.068
Are you sure Director Kim isn't just trying to trick us?

112
00:09:21.198 --> 00:09:23.698
(KM Financial Director Kim Min Kyu Press Conference)

113
00:09:50.999 --> 00:09:53.098
I'm KM Financial's director,

114
00:09:54.299 --> 00:09:55.499
Kim Min Kyu.

115
00:09:58.568 --> 00:09:59.739
I also...

116
00:10:05.409 --> 00:10:06.938
suffer from...

117
00:10:08.909 --> 00:10:10.108
a human allergy.

118
00:10:14.318 --> 00:10:16.448
As soon as I come into physical contact with a human being,

119
00:10:16.549 --> 00:10:18.558
I start having difficulty in breathing,

120
00:10:18.558 --> 00:10:21.458
and I start getting rashes on my body.

121
00:10:22.489 --> 00:10:23.698
And because of this, I always...

122
00:10:24.828 --> 00:10:28.568
carried around my gloves and a baton.

123
00:10:29.198 --> 00:10:30.739
I'm sure a lot of you may wonder...

124
00:10:31.338 --> 00:10:35.208
how someone like me was able to...

125
00:10:35.208 --> 00:10:38.978
stay as a director of a big firm.

126
00:10:39.978 --> 00:10:41.808
Every time I came to the office,

127
00:10:42.749 --> 00:10:46.049
all the employees thankfully kept their distance from me.

128
00:10:46.049 --> 00:10:48.519
Therefore, I had no trouble attending meetings.

129
00:10:48.619 --> 00:10:50.249
And as for my other duties,

130
00:10:51.088 --> 00:10:55.328
I was able to take care of them without a problem...

131
00:10:56.728 --> 00:10:58.358
thanks to Mr. Jo who's standing beside me.

132
00:11:03.999 --> 00:11:08.608
There's one thing I'm proudly able to tell everyone.

133
00:11:08.608 --> 00:11:11.279
I'm slowly starting to heal...

134
00:11:11.279 --> 00:11:12.978
from this...

135
00:11:15.078 --> 00:11:17.078
so-called human allergy.

136
00:11:19.619 --> 00:11:21.249
One day, out of the blue,

137
00:11:23.489 --> 00:11:25.759
a robot suddenly entered my life.

138
00:11:27.159 --> 00:11:28.659
I became friends...

139
00:11:29.828 --> 00:11:31.358
with that robot.

140
00:11:34.269 --> 00:11:36.098
And I tried to connect with it.

141
00:11:39.399 --> 00:11:40.409
Yes.

142
00:11:43.568 --> 00:11:45.279
That's what happened.

143
00:11:50.049 --> 00:11:51.578
That robot...

144
00:11:53.818 --> 00:11:55.318
was sometimes human...

145
00:11:57.088 --> 00:11:59.389
and sometimes a robot.

146
00:12:01.529 --> 00:12:02.688
My emotions...

147
00:12:04.759 --> 00:12:05.828
were input...

148
00:12:07.098 --> 00:12:08.228
into that robot...

149
00:12:08.999 --> 00:12:10.999
and that person.

150
00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:13.909
That's how...

151
00:12:16.568 --> 00:12:19.279
this miracle happened.

152
00:12:27.448 --> 00:12:28.519
That fact...

153
00:12:29.188 --> 00:12:32.989
completely changed the way I view things.

154
00:12:33.289 --> 00:12:34.289
This will be...

155
00:12:34.928 --> 00:12:39.159
yet another scoop for the reporters present.

156
00:12:40.198 --> 00:12:41.568
KM Financial...

157
00:12:42.499 --> 00:12:46.639
will go from financing mergers and acquisitions to investing in...

158
00:12:46.639 --> 00:12:50.239
futuristic industries that involve human sensibilities.

159
00:12:51.578 --> 00:12:55.779
This is your first change in business strategy in 15 years.

160
00:12:55.909 --> 00:12:58.919
Do you have anything mapped out?

161
00:12:59.478 --> 00:13:01.848
First of all, KM Financial...

162
00:13:02.119 --> 00:13:04.159
will invest heavily in developing robots with AI...

163
00:13:04.159 --> 00:13:07.058
that can communicate with us on an emotional level.

164
00:13:07.058 --> 00:13:10.159
With Doctor Hong Baek Gyoon, a renowned engineer,

165
00:13:10.358 --> 00:13:13.629
we will bring in the fourth industrial revolution,

166
00:13:14.468 --> 00:13:17.198
and we will offer any support necessary.

167
00:13:17.669 --> 00:13:20.139
Is Doctor Hong in Seoul?

168
00:13:20.139 --> 00:13:22.739
- Can we interview him? - Is your allergy curable?

169
00:13:22.739 --> 00:13:25.239
- Look over here. - Where is that robot?

170
00:13:25.509 --> 00:13:26.739
Can you tell us?

171
00:13:26.739 --> 00:13:28.708
Can you tell us anything else?

172
00:13:34.519 --> 00:13:37.389
Doctor, it looks like you'll have quite a hassle.

173
00:13:40.458 --> 00:13:43.558
We'll bring in the fourth industrial revolution...

174
00:13:47.799 --> 00:13:50.068
I suddenly feel a weight on my shoulders.

175
00:13:50.399 --> 00:13:52.739
You're really heavy, stop it.

176
00:13:55.808 --> 00:13:58.708
Doctor, can you see me in private?

177
00:13:59.578 --> 00:14:02.078
Our stock price is soaring.

178
00:14:02.078 --> 00:14:04.178
- Is it really? - What's going on?

179
00:14:04.178 --> 00:14:06.218
- My goodness. - It's skyrocketing.

180
00:14:06.318 --> 00:14:08.119
It went up so much.

181
00:14:08.119 --> 00:14:09.289
Look.

182
00:14:09.289 --> 00:14:11.718
May I have your attention, please?

183
00:14:11.718 --> 00:14:13.159
We're running out of time.

184
00:14:13.159 --> 00:14:15.858
We shall now vote on dismissing Director Kim...

185
00:14:17.759 --> 00:14:21.499
The press conference we just saw convinced me...

186
00:14:22.228 --> 00:14:25.669
beyond a shadow of a doubt that Director Kim is someone...

187
00:14:26.539 --> 00:14:28.239
we can't do without.

188
00:14:29.938 --> 00:14:30.978
I, therefore,

189
00:14:31.708 --> 00:14:35.848
agree wholeheartedly with Director Kim's new road map.

190
00:14:36.779 --> 00:14:37.879
As a shareholder...

191
00:14:38.948 --> 00:14:41.318
and as Chairman Hwang's representative,

192
00:14:42.919 --> 00:14:44.858
on the agenda of Director Kim's dismissal,

193
00:14:47.428 --> 00:14:48.458
I vote no.

194
00:14:48.588 --> 00:14:50.188
What do you mean?

195
00:14:50.188 --> 00:14:52.598
- We came to vote yes. - What's happening?

196
00:14:52.598 --> 00:14:54.698
- What's going on? - It's nonsense.

197
00:14:54.698 --> 00:14:56.869
I also support Director Kim Min Kyu.

198
00:14:58.799 --> 00:15:00.098
I'm against his dismissal.

199
00:15:00.098 --> 00:15:03.009
- My goodness. - What is happening here?

200
00:15:04.978 --> 00:15:08.848
- We came here to get rid of him. - What are they talking about?

201
00:15:08.848 --> 00:15:10.419
This is a mess.

202
00:15:13.649 --> 00:15:15.818
- Hi, did you watch? - Yes.

203
00:15:16.119 --> 00:15:20.659
Kim Min Kyu, you were awesomely, incredibly cool.

204
00:15:21.058 --> 00:15:23.588
This is the kind of guy your boyfriend is.

205
00:15:25.228 --> 00:15:27.369
I have to go to the company.

206
00:15:27.369 --> 00:15:29.769
Go and wait somewhere. I'll come over later.

207
00:15:30.169 --> 00:15:31.269
Thank you.

208
00:15:31.938 --> 00:15:33.598
Okay, good luck wrapping it up.

209
00:15:36.608 --> 00:15:38.379
You have to really do your best.

210
00:15:38.608 --> 00:15:40.509
You know I invested in you, right?

211
00:15:43.078 --> 00:15:44.818
Thank you, but...

212
00:15:45.948 --> 00:15:47.119
will you be okay?

213
00:15:48.848 --> 00:15:50.289
I trust your competence.

214
00:15:50.789 --> 00:15:54.289
That's why I'm excited about the new future you proposed.

215
00:15:55.129 --> 00:15:57.428
Will there be a lot I can do too?

216
00:15:58.499 --> 00:16:03.098
Actually, Yoo Cheol worked harder than I to convince the directors.

217
00:16:07.708 --> 00:16:10.708
I think I should leave and let you talk out...

218
00:16:10.978 --> 00:16:13.279
the misunderstandings you had for 15 years.

219
00:16:26.818 --> 00:16:27.858
I found out...

220
00:16:29.529 --> 00:16:31.928
what the papers I had given to you meant.

221
00:16:32.358 --> 00:16:34.698
What my dad had tried to do to you.

222
00:16:37.239 --> 00:16:39.369
I'd found the papers in my dad's study.

223
00:16:41.909 --> 00:16:42.968
But...

224
00:16:44.139 --> 00:16:46.438
I couldn't tell you that I knew.

225
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:49.848
I pretended not to know what had happened.

226
00:16:53.419 --> 00:16:55.588
I pretended I had not wronged you at all.

227
00:16:56.588 --> 00:17:00.058
I believed my dad hadn't done that out of malice.

228
00:17:02.489 --> 00:17:04.098
That's how I rationalized it away.

229
00:17:05.259 --> 00:17:06.729
Just to protect myself.

230
00:17:15.209 --> 00:17:16.308
It was cowardly...

231
00:17:18.108 --> 00:17:19.179
and foolish.

232
00:17:23.578 --> 00:17:25.418
Sorry it took so long.

233
00:17:31.989 --> 00:17:33.158
I'm sorry, Min Kyu.

234
00:17:41.699 --> 00:17:42.898
We found evidence...

235
00:17:44.439 --> 00:17:46.568
that Martin killed Chairman Park Sung Jin.

236
00:17:48.068 --> 00:17:49.368
Interpol got involved.

237
00:17:50.709 --> 00:17:51.739
Go and...

238
00:17:53.509 --> 00:17:54.749
convince your dad.

239
00:17:56.608 --> 00:17:58.118
He must confess first...

240
00:17:59.578 --> 00:18:00.789
to get a lower sentence.

241
00:18:07.328 --> 00:18:08.358
Okay.

242
00:18:10.158 --> 00:18:11.429
Thanks for the tip.

243
00:18:39.088 --> 00:18:40.158
I think...

244
00:18:41.689 --> 00:18:43.959
I'll be okay this time.

245
00:18:55.983 --> 00:19:00.983
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E31 I'm Not a Robot "A New Beginning"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

246
00:19:13.729 --> 00:19:15.259
Hi, where are you?

247
00:19:16.658 --> 00:19:19.959
Shall we meet on the street we walked when it snowed?

248
00:19:21.168 --> 00:19:23.868
Shall we? Okay, I'll be right there.

249
00:19:28.209 --> 00:19:29.269
When...

250
00:19:30.638 --> 00:19:31.779
How long...

251
00:19:33.179 --> 00:19:35.408
have you been standing there?

252
00:19:35.878 --> 00:19:39.019
Quite a while now. I knocked before coming in.

253
00:19:42.489 --> 00:19:43.719
Have a seat.

254
00:19:57.398 --> 00:20:00.168
You did very well today.

255
00:20:00.168 --> 00:20:01.239
Thank you.

256
00:20:01.838 --> 00:20:03.939
I think we sorted everything out.

257
00:20:04.679 --> 00:20:06.209
What do you think?

258
00:20:07.148 --> 00:20:08.709
Yes, I think so too.

259
00:20:08.709 --> 00:20:11.219
We should all go home early today.

260
00:20:11.549 --> 00:20:14.118
In that case, I'd like you to accept...

261
00:20:15.019 --> 00:20:16.818
my letter of resignation.

262
00:20:17.658 --> 00:20:18.719
What?

263
00:20:19.588 --> 00:20:20.588
That...

264
00:20:22.229 --> 00:20:23.759
I already said...

265
00:20:23.759 --> 00:20:25.598
That was your opinion.

266
00:20:26.098 --> 00:20:27.828
I have not changed my mind...

267
00:20:29.168 --> 00:20:30.568
about resigning.

268
00:20:32.299 --> 00:20:33.299
But...

269
00:20:33.299 --> 00:20:36.168
I stayed because there was a lot to do.

270
00:20:36.808 --> 00:20:39.378
Now everything's done, so as planned,

271
00:20:40.209 --> 00:20:41.848
I should leave as well.

272
00:20:44.249 --> 00:20:45.318
Mr. Jo.

273
00:20:47.148 --> 00:20:48.289
Please, sir.

274
00:20:53.789 --> 00:20:54.789
Then...

275
00:20:55.959 --> 00:20:57.128
goodbye.

276
00:21:16.608 --> 00:21:18.779
Why do you want to buy clothes?

277
00:21:19.078 --> 00:21:21.719
You'll be swamped with interview requests now.

278
00:21:21.719 --> 00:21:23.618
I'll wear what I have.

279
00:21:24.719 --> 00:21:26.158
Don't you think...

280
00:21:26.489 --> 00:21:28.459
Min Kyu has an unusual charm?

281
00:21:29.529 --> 00:21:31.658
He looks like a little brother at home,

282
00:21:32.029 --> 00:21:35.269
but at work, he has this killer charisma.

283
00:21:35.898 --> 00:21:38.368
He's a director for a reason.

284
00:21:38.368 --> 00:21:40.068
He put up a good fight.

285
00:21:41.469 --> 00:21:42.638
What about me?

286
00:21:42.969 --> 00:21:46.539
I'm used to you, so it's impossible to find a new side of you.

287
00:21:52.219 --> 00:21:53.219
What is it?

288
00:21:54.249 --> 00:21:55.489
Do you want to go out with me?

289
00:21:56.318 --> 00:21:58.219
What?

290
00:22:06.529 --> 00:22:08.229
How long are you going to stare?

291
00:22:08.328 --> 00:22:10.068
Until you look back at me.

292
00:22:11.368 --> 00:22:13.039
There. Happy?

293
00:22:13.138 --> 00:22:14.338
Do you want to go out with me?

294
00:22:16.838 --> 00:22:18.779
Why are you laughing?

295
00:22:20.878 --> 00:22:21.949
Let's go.

296
00:22:23.608 --> 00:22:26.918
Dr. Hong, aren't you going to answer me?

297
00:22:32.618 --> 00:22:34.628
It's cold. Let's go.

298
00:22:53.378 --> 00:22:55.009
Dad, I'm sorry.

299
00:22:56.249 --> 00:22:59.049
I'm not the daughter you wanted me to be.

300
00:22:59.818 --> 00:23:01.648
But, I'll live happily.

301
00:23:02.019 --> 00:23:04.358
I know that deep in your heart,

302
00:23:06.189 --> 00:23:07.888
you would want me to be happy.

303
00:23:10.828 --> 00:23:12.398
That's what I believe.

304
00:23:24.638 --> 00:23:27.279
I thought you were nervous, but you did so well.

305
00:23:27.408 --> 00:23:31.348
I was really nervous at first,

306
00:23:31.749 --> 00:23:34.449
but I was able to see you after taking a deep breath.

307
00:23:34.648 --> 00:23:37.689
From that point on, I was able to talk smoothly.

308
00:23:37.689 --> 00:23:40.858
It's my soul that helped you.

309
00:23:44.199 --> 00:23:45.459
Also,

310
00:23:47.368 --> 00:23:50.098
it was my first time in 15 years...

311
00:23:51.039 --> 00:23:53.598
to talk properly with Yoo Cheol.

312
00:23:54.638 --> 00:23:58.279
I even suggested that we shake hands first.

313
00:23:58.279 --> 00:24:01.679
For some reason, I thought it would be okay.

314
00:24:02.078 --> 00:24:03.878
- You shook hands? - Yes.

315
00:24:03.878 --> 00:24:05.378
Were you okay?

316
00:24:05.979 --> 00:24:07.418
Yes.

317
00:24:07.418 --> 00:24:10.719
Ever since I saw you, I think I was fine.

318
00:24:11.418 --> 00:24:13.858
You should take good care of this treasure of yours.

319
00:24:16.029 --> 00:24:18.199
Gosh, it's so cold.

320
00:24:19.328 --> 00:24:20.568
Come here.

321
00:24:23.838 --> 00:24:25.638
If you're cold, why are you giving this to me?

322
00:24:25.739 --> 00:24:27.668
To take good care of my treasure.

323
00:24:32.239 --> 00:24:35.549
What do you want to do today? I'll do anything for you.

324
00:24:36.179 --> 00:24:40.888
From now on, I'm going to get really busy.

325
00:24:40.888 --> 00:24:42.888
Let's have a lot of fun today.

326
00:24:47.158 --> 00:24:50.058
Do you know how much I wanted to bring you here?

327
00:24:50.158 --> 00:24:52.158
Do you want me to make a place like this at home?

328
00:24:52.158 --> 00:24:53.668
Will you come visit every day, then?

329
00:24:53.668 --> 00:24:56.199
Let's warm up first.

330
00:24:59.299 --> 00:25:00.838
Do you know how to play this?

331
00:25:01.568 --> 00:25:02.769
Yes.

332
00:25:04.338 --> 00:25:05.479
Here I go.

333
00:25:08.648 --> 00:25:09.878
Yes!

334
00:25:09.878 --> 00:25:10.918
What?

335
00:25:11.378 --> 00:25:12.549
Throw it.

336
00:25:13.279 --> 00:25:14.388
Hit it.

337
00:25:19.588 --> 00:25:20.789
Game over.

338
00:25:20.789 --> 00:25:22.189
Yes!

339
00:25:23.628 --> 00:25:24.759
Let's play something else.

340
00:25:26.128 --> 00:25:28.929
Die. Die.

341
00:25:28.999 --> 00:25:30.598
Die!

342
00:25:39.939 --> 00:25:41.709
That's not fair.

343
00:25:43.148 --> 00:25:44.578
Do it again.

344
00:25:54.429 --> 00:25:55.558
Wait.

345
00:25:56.558 --> 00:25:58.398
I lost again?

346
00:25:59.029 --> 00:26:01.828
Two points, two points, two points,

347
00:26:01.828 --> 00:26:03.969
two points, two points.

348
00:26:07.638 --> 00:26:09.638
- Let's go for another round. - No.

349
00:26:09.638 --> 00:26:12.279
Are we stopping just because you won?

350
00:26:12.279 --> 00:26:15.749
I want to keep this feeling of victory in my heart forever.

351
00:26:15.749 --> 00:26:17.648
You said you would do anything I want today.

352
00:26:17.749 --> 00:26:19.979
I will pay for dinner tonight.

353
00:26:19.979 --> 00:26:21.489
Get whatever you want.

354
00:26:23.348 --> 00:26:26.358
Wait. Is this really what you want?

355
00:26:26.358 --> 00:26:27.358
Yes.

356
00:26:35.398 --> 00:26:37.338
Seriously.

357
00:26:41.638 --> 00:26:42.808
Hey.

358
00:26:43.469 --> 00:26:49.348
What is Mr. Jo like?

359
00:26:51.078 --> 00:26:53.148
Once he says no, it's a no.

360
00:26:57.219 --> 00:27:00.558
I see. What kind of person is he to you?

361
00:27:02.429 --> 00:27:03.898
Someone like a dad?

362
00:27:05.729 --> 00:27:06.929
Mr. Jo...

363
00:27:07.969 --> 00:27:09.229
quit today.

364
00:27:09.229 --> 00:27:10.739
What? Really?

365
00:27:10.739 --> 00:27:11.739
Yes.

366
00:27:12.638 --> 00:27:14.068
I don't know...

367
00:27:14.769 --> 00:27:17.979
how to persuade him.

368
00:27:21.608 --> 00:27:23.179
Mr. Jo...

369
00:27:23.608 --> 00:27:25.078
Quit?

370
00:27:25.279 --> 00:27:26.618
Ji A's brother?

371
00:27:26.618 --> 00:27:28.019
He handed in a resignation letter?

372
00:27:30.959 --> 00:27:32.558
Did you offend him or something?

373
00:27:35.658 --> 00:27:38.058
Maybe a little? It was a while ago.

374
00:27:38.898 --> 00:27:42.128
To be honest, a lot. But...

375
00:27:42.128 --> 00:27:43.739
it wasn't anything recent.

376
00:27:44.368 --> 00:27:48.039
I don't think he's the type to hold grudges.

377
00:27:48.039 --> 00:27:50.408
Hey, didn't you see him...

378
00:27:50.408 --> 00:27:51.878
sue his own sister?

379
00:27:51.878 --> 00:27:53.308
Grudges?

380
00:27:53.308 --> 00:27:55.608
He's such a stubborn guy.

381
00:27:55.608 --> 00:27:57.078
He must be uncomfortable.

382
00:27:57.719 --> 00:27:58.749
With what?

383
00:27:58.749 --> 00:28:01.148
To have his sister's boyfriend as his boss.

384
00:28:01.148 --> 00:28:04.388
You're right. I just imagined it, and it's so uncomfortable.

385
00:28:04.388 --> 00:28:06.088
Would it be that uncomfortable?

386
00:28:06.588 --> 00:28:09.789
I thought we were a good match.

387
00:28:09.789 --> 00:28:13.398
Work is work. It's different when it's personal.

388
00:28:13.699 --> 00:28:17.168
Is this season two of turning Kim Min Kyu into a human?

389
00:28:17.168 --> 00:28:18.269
Yes.

390
00:28:18.769 --> 00:28:21.908
I got it. This is it.

391
00:28:21.908 --> 00:28:22.908
What is it?

392
00:28:22.908 --> 00:28:26.378
He doesn't like you as Ji A's boyfriend.

393
00:28:26.378 --> 00:28:27.509
Hey.

394
00:28:27.509 --> 00:28:30.848
- Watch your mouth. - Keep that closed.

395
00:28:32.078 --> 00:28:35.088
They're not helpful at all.

396
00:28:39.219 --> 00:28:42.628
Why are you following me in? I'm going to rest.

397
00:28:57.108 --> 00:28:59.209
- What is it? - Hey.

398
00:28:59.209 --> 00:29:02.249
Where do kids go for dates these days?

399
00:29:03.209 --> 00:29:05.378
Why are you asking me such a thing?

400
00:29:05.378 --> 00:29:08.689
Why? Can't I ask a question?

401
00:29:08.689 --> 00:29:10.618
You don't have anyone to go on a date with.

402
00:29:10.989 --> 00:29:13.219
What is it? Do you?

403
00:29:14.489 --> 00:29:17.699
No way. There are no women around.

404
00:29:20.668 --> 00:29:21.799
Be quiet.

405
00:29:23.429 --> 00:29:24.598
I said, be quiet.

406
00:29:24.969 --> 00:29:27.638
Wow! Since when?

407
00:29:29.408 --> 00:29:30.939
Hey,

408
00:29:32.108 --> 00:29:33.949
you guys actually look good together.

409
00:29:34.709 --> 00:29:37.578
- Of course. - I went to a fun place today.

410
00:29:37.578 --> 00:29:38.719
Do you want to know where?

411
00:29:38.719 --> 00:29:39.878
Where is it?

412
00:29:40.388 --> 00:29:42.148
This is for you.

413
00:29:42.148 --> 00:29:44.588
- Thank you. - No problem.

414
00:29:45.259 --> 00:29:48.328
Hey, did you really quit work?

415
00:29:48.328 --> 00:29:50.628
It's not because of you, so don't worry.

416
00:29:50.628 --> 00:29:53.868
What? You quit work?

417
00:29:56.699 --> 00:29:57.769
Hong Joo.

418
00:29:58.539 --> 00:30:01.168
Are you kidding me right now?

419
00:30:01.168 --> 00:30:03.779
When you confessed everything to me,

420
00:30:03.779 --> 00:30:05.979
I told you to never lie to me again.

421
00:30:06.039 --> 00:30:09.449
What is this? You quit without telling me?

422
00:30:09.449 --> 00:30:10.449
Well...

423
00:30:11.049 --> 00:30:13.519
I handed in the resignation letter quite some time ago.

424
00:30:13.519 --> 00:30:16.289
What? You handed in a resignation letter a while ago?

425
00:30:17.189 --> 00:30:20.429
This is making me really mad. Gosh...

426
00:30:20.429 --> 00:30:21.759
- Hong Joo, calm down. - Hong Joo.

427
00:30:21.759 --> 00:30:22.888
Stop!

428
00:30:23.588 --> 00:30:25.158
How can I calm down?

429
00:30:25.158 --> 00:30:28.628
Mom, you will scare the baby.

430
00:30:28.929 --> 00:30:30.338
Right. I'm sorry.

431
00:30:31.398 --> 00:30:34.808
How are you so inflexible?

432
00:30:34.908 --> 00:30:37.378
Go get your resignation letter back right away.

433
00:30:38.539 --> 00:30:39.709
Answer me.

434
00:30:40.108 --> 00:30:41.148
Okay.

435
00:30:47.918 --> 00:30:49.318
You fool.

436
00:30:51.118 --> 00:30:53.759
It's not over yet. You can...

437
00:30:53.759 --> 00:30:55.029
No.

438
00:30:56.388 --> 00:30:57.858
It's over.

439
00:30:58.328 --> 00:31:00.259
They found evidence...

440
00:31:00.259 --> 00:31:02.128
where Martin admitted his murder.

441
00:31:02.128 --> 00:31:03.598
Before he's arrested,

442
00:31:03.598 --> 00:31:06.098
you need to confess everything you know.

443
00:31:06.098 --> 00:31:07.939
That's the only way to reduce your sentence.

444
00:31:08.209 --> 00:31:09.539
Impossible!

445
00:31:09.539 --> 00:31:12.338
It's not over for Hwang Do Won!

446
00:31:12.908 --> 00:31:15.249
Come to your senses, Father.

447
00:31:16.279 --> 00:31:17.348
Please.

448
00:31:24.818 --> 00:31:28.058
So, you will pay for a portion of the rent...

449
00:31:28.058 --> 00:31:29.529
in exchange for a corner in the cafe?

450
00:31:29.529 --> 00:31:32.929
Yes. What was it called again? Shop...

451
00:31:32.929 --> 00:31:34.699
- Shop in shop? - Yes.

452
00:31:34.699 --> 00:31:38.299
I want to do that in a corner of your cafe.

453
00:31:38.299 --> 00:31:40.739
I will use it as my office as well as a showroom.

454
00:31:41.908 --> 00:31:43.239
I like that. Let's do it.

455
00:31:44.739 --> 00:31:47.449
What about development expenses? Last time, Hong Joo...

456
00:31:47.449 --> 00:31:49.808
She's furious right now. I can't ask her.

457
00:31:49.808 --> 00:31:51.749
Why? Did something happen?

458
00:31:51.848 --> 00:31:54.189
My brother quit his job.

459
00:31:56.189 --> 00:31:57.519
I can see why she's mad.

460
00:31:57.519 --> 00:31:59.959
Ask Kim Min Kyu to invest.

461
00:31:59.959 --> 00:32:01.429
Isn't it an investment company now?

462
00:32:01.628 --> 00:32:03.029
I will make it work on my own.

463
00:32:03.388 --> 00:32:06.558
Something called crowdfunding or something.

464
00:32:06.558 --> 00:32:08.929
- "Crowdfunding"? - Yes.

465
00:32:08.929 --> 00:32:11.299
It's a medium where I publish my idea on the internet...

466
00:32:11.299 --> 00:32:13.838
to receive investment.

467
00:32:13.838 --> 00:32:16.838
Then, give me a percentage of your earnings...

468
00:32:16.838 --> 00:32:18.709
instead of paying rent.

469
00:32:18.709 --> 00:32:20.308
Let's go, Jo Ji A!

470
00:32:20.308 --> 00:32:21.509
Yes!

471
00:32:21.509 --> 00:32:23.449
Now, I...

472
00:32:28.588 --> 00:32:31.058
have to go on a date.

473
00:32:31.058 --> 00:32:32.459
I'll close shop.

474
00:32:32.459 --> 00:32:33.588
Okay.

475
00:32:58.479 --> 00:33:00.989
Are you feeling all right?

476
00:33:01.888 --> 00:33:04.519
Yes. I'm all better now.

477
00:33:04.519 --> 00:33:06.058
I'm just like everyone else.

478
00:33:06.058 --> 00:33:07.388
I could even touch you.

479
00:33:18.039 --> 00:33:20.338
I'm sorry...

480
00:33:23.709 --> 00:33:24.838
- Hey. - Hey.

481
00:33:28.049 --> 00:33:29.378
Please, go ahead.

482
00:33:32.078 --> 00:33:33.148
Well...

483
00:33:34.719 --> 00:33:38.459
It's about your resignation letter.

484
00:33:38.459 --> 00:33:40.289
Yes. The letter...

485
00:33:45.299 --> 00:33:47.799
I think I should...

486
00:33:49.299 --> 00:33:50.398
Well...

487
00:33:53.168 --> 00:33:55.068
The resignation letter...

488
00:33:55.439 --> 00:33:58.838
Okay. I will just process it, then.

489
00:33:59.378 --> 00:34:02.009
It looks like your mind is set.

490
00:34:03.408 --> 00:34:08.418
I would really prefer for you to stay on the team,

491
00:34:09.389 --> 00:34:12.288
but maybe you're uncomfortable because of Ji A.

492
00:34:12.788 --> 00:34:14.628
But,

493
00:34:15.059 --> 00:34:18.559
if you ever change your mind, please don't hesitate to tell me.

494
00:34:18.559 --> 00:34:21.469
I would welcome you back.

495
00:34:34.679 --> 00:34:36.079
Yes. What is it?

496
00:34:36.978 --> 00:34:38.719
Where are you?

497
00:34:38.878 --> 00:34:40.248
Summer Snow.

498
00:34:41.088 --> 00:34:42.389
Should I come over?

499
00:34:43.119 --> 00:34:44.918
I'm working.

500
00:34:46.358 --> 00:34:48.159
What's more important? Me or work?

501
00:34:49.188 --> 00:34:52.329
Work is important, and so are you.

502
00:34:52.829 --> 00:34:55.728
Gosh. I miss you a lot.

503
00:34:56.099 --> 00:34:57.768
I miss you too.

504
00:34:58.969 --> 00:35:01.538
I'll call you when I finish this.

505
00:35:02.438 --> 00:35:04.478
Okay. Bye.

506
00:35:04.708 --> 00:35:07.079
(Crowdfunding Registration)

507
00:35:18.259 --> 00:35:20.358
I can sit here for a while, right?

508
00:35:24.099 --> 00:35:26.998
You can work. I'll just watch you.

509
00:35:27.529 --> 00:35:29.099
You're not allowed to talk to me.

510
00:35:45.248 --> 00:35:47.248
Fine. What is it? Tell me.

511
00:35:48.688 --> 00:35:49.849
Well...

512
00:35:50.588 --> 00:35:52.288
Mr. Jo...

513
00:35:52.288 --> 00:35:53.659
Right, my brother!

514
00:35:53.659 --> 00:35:56.059
He must have come to see you to get his registration letter back.

515
00:35:56.059 --> 00:35:58.159
I forgot to tell you.

516
00:35:58.929 --> 00:36:02.128
- What? - His wife has him under her thumb.

517
00:36:02.128 --> 00:36:05.838
She ordered him to get it back. It's good news, right?

518
00:36:05.838 --> 00:36:07.608
Did you see him today?

519
00:36:07.938 --> 00:36:11.608
Yes. We met up...

520
00:36:11.838 --> 00:36:12.878
And?

521
00:36:13.538 --> 00:36:16.708
I told him I would process it.

522
00:36:16.809 --> 00:36:18.318
I see.

523
00:36:18.978 --> 00:36:21.949
I'm suddenly getting a headache.

524
00:36:22.648 --> 00:36:25.088
This isn't working. Come over to my house.

525
00:36:27.728 --> 00:36:28.788
What?

526
00:36:30.955 --> 00:36:33.655
(Final episode  will air shortly.)
