1
00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:19.840
Geu Rim.

2
00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:27.910
Did you really think...

3
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.280
if you got Ji Soo Ho to join,

4
00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:36.420
you could be the main writer?

5
00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:42.420
Wake up, will you, Geu Rim?

6
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.630
Even if you're good...

7
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.500
at winning over guests...

8
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.000
and at kissing up to people,

9
00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.329
if you can't write,

10
00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.539
you'll go on air and humiliate yourself.

11
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.710
You know your limitations,

12
00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:58.310
don't you?

13
00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:01.780
I don't know how you got Lee Gang...

14
00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.409
to pick you to be the main writer,

15
00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:07.379
but Ji Soo Ho...

16
00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.420
Do you really think that's even possible?

17
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.060
Is that why you're here? You think it can happen?

18
00:01:15.489 --> 00:01:18.989
Like Ji Soo Ho would really DJ a radio show.

19
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.299
Geu Rim. I'm saying this...

20
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.030
because I'm concerned for you. I mean it.

21
00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:27.500
Wake up and smell the coffee!

22
00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:28.799
The probability of him becoming a radio DJ...

23
00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.069
is much worse than you becoming a main writer.

24
00:01:32.769 --> 00:01:33.780
Got that?

25
00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.110
I'll do the radio show.

26
00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:43.689
Let's do the radio show.

27
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.630
Let go, Soo Ho.

28
00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:34.440
I said, let go.

29
00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:37.640
What kind of act are you putting on?

30
00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.179
Why did you come here?

31
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.709
Do you really have no pride?

32
00:02:44.249 --> 00:02:46.320
Why were you just listening to all that?

33
00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:48.149
What did you say?

34
00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:49.720
Who is she?

35
00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.489
Why can't you say anything back at her?

36
00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:55.690
I know, right?

37
00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.589
I must have zero self-esteem.

38
00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.200
That's why...

39
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.100
I would follow you around after all you did.

40
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.679
(Episode 3)

41
00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:19.149
Hey, Geu Rim.

42
00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.220
What was that?

43
00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.989
What's wrong with Ms. La?

44
00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.019
Also, what's with Ji Soo Ho?

45
00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:28.160
Did Ms. La leave?

46
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.660
After you and Soo Ho left hand in hand...

47
00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.529
Don't even mention it.

48
00:03:33.529 --> 00:03:36.470
She made such a fuss before leaving.

49
00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:40.640
What's going on between you and Soo Ho?

50
00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:44.440
Let's get a beer.

51
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:45.940
Beer?

52
00:03:46.679 --> 00:03:48.380
My writer told me...

53
00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.910
to finish all of these before going home.

54
00:03:51.179 --> 00:03:52.779
I won't be going home.

55
00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:54.549
I have to go.

56
00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:58.989
Make sure to text me...

57
00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.890
what happened between you and Soo Ho. Got it?

58
00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.090
Did you watch the video I sent you?

59
00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:11.230
All of it? From start to finish?

60
00:05:11.989 --> 00:05:12.999
No.

61
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.160
If you didn't,

62
00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.970
how did you know to come here?

63
00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:27.509
Do you want one?

64
00:05:29.239 --> 00:05:30.249
No.

65
00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.460
I keep letting you see the worst of me.

66
00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:44.660
It's been days already.

67
00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:50.129
The drama world is your home ground.

68
00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.470
I was very embarrassed there.

69
00:05:57.309 --> 00:05:58.410
But,

70
00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:02.580
radio is my home ground.

71
00:06:04.179 --> 00:06:06.920
And I'm just as embarrassed right now.

72
00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:11.049
Please leave.

73
00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:18.530
This is my hideout.

74
00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:20.400
Okay?

75
00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.230
Just go, will you?

76
00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:31.210
I just said...

77
00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:32.710
your famous line.

78
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:34.309
I can't believe I said it.

79
00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.809
"Just go."

80
00:06:36.809 --> 00:06:38.549
"Please, just go."

81
00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:41.619
How annoying.

82
00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:48.759
Are you crying?

83
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.889
No one's crying.

84
00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:52.790
You're talking nonsense.

85
00:06:54.799 --> 00:06:56.369
I would never cry...

86
00:06:56.369 --> 00:06:58.770
from something like this. I'm not weak.

87
00:07:01.369 --> 00:07:02.439
I wouldn't...

88
00:07:06.239 --> 00:07:07.939
If I promise to be on the radio,

89
00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:10.449
will you stop crying?

90
00:07:14.749 --> 00:07:15.949
Come over to my place tomorrow.

91
00:07:18.989 --> 00:07:19.989
I'm sorry?

92
00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:22.759
We'll sign the contract.

93
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:51.920
Hey, man.

94
00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:55.989
Okay. Hey. Hey.

95
00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.160
Hey.

96
00:07:57.389 --> 00:07:58.389
Hey, man.

97
00:07:59.629 --> 00:08:01.230
How can anyone be so...

98
00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:03.530
I mean, you're great. You're perfect.

99
00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:05.129
Let me ask you one thing.

100
00:08:05.129 --> 00:08:07.340
That's good news. Ask me 100 questions.

101
00:08:07.439 --> 00:08:09.540
Why did I agree to doing the radio?

102
00:08:09.809 --> 00:08:10.809
What?

103
00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:12.439
Are you going to be a DJ?

104
00:08:12.809 --> 00:08:13.809
I don't know.

105
00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:17.410
Hey.

106
00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:21.280
Did you agree to it because of Lady Kamikaze?

107
00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.350
It's not because of Song Geu Rim.

108
00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:25.090
Bravo.

109
00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.590
Did you just get emotional with me?

110
00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:30.090
You just kept talking nonsense.

111
00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:31.189
It's not nonsense.

112
00:08:31.489 --> 00:08:33.860
The Ji Soo Ho I know...

113
00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:36.529
would never sign up for a daily show.

114
00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.840
On top of that, a live show...

115
00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.369
that must air 365 days a week?

116
00:08:41.369 --> 00:08:42.440
Also,

117
00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:45.970
you would never talk to the public...

118
00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:47.779
without a script.

119
00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:52.310
That's what I know about radios,

120
00:08:52.779 --> 00:08:54.320
and you agreed to it.

121
00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:56.989
Lady Kamikaze is pretty amazing.

122
00:08:58.749 --> 00:09:00.119
She hurt my pride.

123
00:09:00.489 --> 00:09:02.389
I have been trying for months...

124
00:09:02.389 --> 00:09:04.360
to tear down the wall you put against me,

125
00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:07.159
but Lady Kamikaze just needed a few days.

126
00:09:09.529 --> 00:09:11.129
How humiliating.

127
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:35.259
If I promise to be on the radio,

128
00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:38.989
will you stop crying?

129
00:09:41.159 --> 00:09:42.399
We'll sign the contract.

130
00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.440
But...

131
00:09:48.139 --> 00:09:49.200
Seriously?

132
00:09:50.239 --> 00:09:53.440
Will Ji Soo Ho really become our DJ?

133
00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:55.300
Ji Soo Ho promised to be your DJ? Are you sure?

134
00:10:55.869 --> 00:10:59.070
Ji Soo Ho is willing to do a daily show?

135
00:11:01.139 --> 00:11:04.110
Are you sure you told him it's a daily show?

136
00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:07.050
He probably doesn't know.

137
00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:09.789
Maybe he thinks it's like a television show...

138
00:11:09.789 --> 00:11:12.249
where you only need to record once a week.

139
00:11:12.919 --> 00:11:13.960
Are you sure?

140
00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:15.860
Yes.

141
00:11:16.629 --> 00:11:19.899
We haven't signed the contract yet.

142
00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:24.369
Just get him to sign. Get him no matter what.

143
00:11:24.369 --> 00:11:25.700
Get him right now.

144
00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.070
(Contract)

145
00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.710
Get him no matter what.

146
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:34.009
I can see right through you.

147
00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:36.950
Are you the same angry man we saw yesterday?

148
00:11:40.519 --> 00:11:41.649
What are you doing, Ms. Song?

149
00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:45.249
You better go. Get going.

150
00:11:48.259 --> 00:11:50.060
- I'll come with you. - No!

151
00:11:51.489 --> 00:11:52.590
Where do you think you're going?

152
00:11:52.999 --> 00:11:55.029
You can't go there.

153
00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:57.800
You're no help even if you go with her.

154
00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:00.440
Crazy Gang, just sit back down.

155
00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:02.499
Okay.

156
00:12:03.539 --> 00:12:04.669
Go.

157
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:09.409
Okay. I will go on my own then.

158
00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:12.350
Song Geu Rim!

159
00:12:14.019 --> 00:12:15.050
Yes?

160
00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:17.419
Make sure he stamps on it.

161
00:12:18.519 --> 00:12:20.960
If you get it stamped,

162
00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.690
your main writer position...

163
00:12:25.889 --> 00:12:27.800
will be considered.

164
00:12:28.159 --> 00:12:29.230
Okay?

165
00:12:30.869 --> 00:12:31.869
Okay.

166
00:12:32.529 --> 00:12:34.840
- I'll be back. - Okay. Go.

167
00:12:35.399 --> 00:12:37.369
Let's go! Good luck!

168
00:12:41.909 --> 00:12:43.710
I suddenly feel like praying.

169
00:12:44.249 --> 00:12:45.850
Namaste. Namaste.

170
00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:06.999
Hold on.

171
00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:09.539
I'm not ready yet.

172
00:13:10.039 --> 00:13:11.070
Well...

173
00:13:21.649 --> 00:13:23.019
Song Geu Rim.

174
00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:26.360
You really have no pride, do you?

175
00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.759
How can you come here after everything...

176
00:13:30.159 --> 00:13:31.560
you've been through?

177
00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:34.029
However,

178
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:37.570
I'm not recruiting him just for myself.

179
00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:39.399
I really want...

180
00:13:39.399 --> 00:13:42.940
Ji Soo Ho to be introduced to radio. Right?

181
00:13:44.139 --> 00:13:45.570
Yes. Let's get off.

182
00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:49.649
Hold on, Song Geu Rim.

183
00:13:49.779 --> 00:13:52.080
Let's lay out the facts.

184
00:14:00.019 --> 00:14:01.720
I'm sorry. My legs are too long.

185
00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:04.989
Didn't you just trip me on purpose?

186
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:06.430
Of course not.

187
00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:10.129
That happened because he really has long legs.

188
00:14:10.629 --> 00:14:12.930
When I confronted him,

189
00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.940
he said, "Of course not."

190
00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:19.110
It would be wrong of me to still doubt him.

191
00:14:32.889 --> 00:14:33.989
Thank you.

192
00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:37.529
See? He even rescued me.

193
00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:39.830
That sounds like fun.

194
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:42.460
Do I get to take writers to hotels too?

195
00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:46.539
I never came here with a writer before.

196
00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:50.710
About that... Just forget about it.

197
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:54.080
Let's just delete it from my memories.

198
00:15:01.749 --> 00:15:03.820
What? That scared me.

199
00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:06.289
What is this? This is scary.

200
00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:25.239
As you already know,

201
00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:28.110
it's a daily show. You know that, right?

202
00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:31.279
That means you will have to save two hours...

203
00:15:31.279 --> 00:15:33.519
each day of the year for the recording.

204
00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:37.050
Also, it's not a visual medium,

205
00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:39.550
so you won't get as much coverage.

206
00:15:42.759 --> 00:15:45.759
Also... Your recording fee...

207
00:15:45.889 --> 00:15:48.159
might not be satisfactory to you.

208
00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:51.430
We probably cannot offer you enough.

209
00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:54.340
However, you're willing to do it. Thank you.

210
00:16:03.149 --> 00:16:04.149
What is this?

211
00:16:04.749 --> 00:16:05.810
The contract.

212
00:16:07.019 --> 00:16:08.080
The contract?

213
00:16:08.119 --> 00:16:10.950
Take a look, and tell me if you can put up with it.

214
00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:27.940
Number 1. No live shows. Only recorded shows.

215
00:16:28.399 --> 00:16:31.310
Number 2. Ji Soo Ho has jurisdiction...

216
00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:32.509
over script and guest.

217
00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:36.310
Number 3. Ji Soo Ho can quit whenever he wants.

218
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:38.610
Number 4. Song Geu Rim must agree...

219
00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:40.149
to everything Ji Soo Ho says.

220
00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:42.080
What is this?

221
00:16:42.419 --> 00:16:44.450
This doesn't make any sense.

222
00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:45.690
That's too bad.

223
00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:47.289
But...

224
00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:49.460
the virtue of radio is doing it live.

225
00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:51.330
If you don't want to do it live...

226
00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:54.360
I only want to do it when everything is set.

227
00:16:55.499 --> 00:16:58.300
The production director and the staff...

228
00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:00.769
decide on the script and the guests together.

229
00:17:00.769 --> 00:17:02.539
I'm telling you I will decide.

230
00:17:04.169 --> 00:17:08.139
Also, how can you quit whenever you want?

231
00:17:08.379 --> 00:17:10.709
Once a radio program starts,

232
00:17:10.709 --> 00:17:12.979
they're planned for the long term.

233
00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:15.119
The least you can do is for a year.

234
00:17:15.379 --> 00:17:18.419
I'll try it for a month, then decide later.

235
00:17:20.189 --> 00:17:21.189
But...

236
00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:22.590
(Song Geu Rim must agree...)

237
00:17:22.689 --> 00:17:24.189
What is this one?

238
00:17:25.129 --> 00:17:27.429
Am I signing up to become a slave?

239
00:17:27.629 --> 00:17:29.869
You can think about it, then contact me.

240
00:17:29.869 --> 00:17:31.699
I have another schedule to go to.

241
00:17:32.469 --> 00:17:34.240
Wait, I got it.

242
00:17:35.199 --> 00:17:38.369
I'll contact you after talking to my boss.

243
00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:42.939
Could you read through our contract too?

244
00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:49.250
Right. How can we contact you?

245
00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:51.189
- You don't have a phone. - Do you want my number?

246
00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:00.830
Yes. Well...

247
00:18:10.909 --> 00:18:11.969
Thank you.

248
00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:16.550
I'll get going now.

249
00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:19.919
Bye.

250
00:18:20.379 --> 00:18:21.449
Bye.

251
00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.330
What is it that you want to say?

252
00:18:36.869 --> 00:18:38.000
I...

253
00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:40.969
I'm getting butterflies.

254
00:18:42.869 --> 00:18:45.639
I cannot wait to see the faces you make...

255
00:18:45.639 --> 00:18:47.610
in front of Lady Kamikaze in the future.

256
00:18:49.409 --> 00:18:51.810
What if Lady Kamikaze...

257
00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:54.179
agrees to your contract?

258
00:18:54.479 --> 00:18:55.820
There is no way she would do it.

259
00:18:55.919 --> 00:18:57.520
- I would. - What?

260
00:18:58.149 --> 00:19:00.090
Wouldn't it be so much fun for her to work with you?

261
00:19:00.119 --> 00:19:02.820
I really hope she signs the contract.

262
00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:11.229
I don't get why you're mad,

263
00:19:11.229 --> 00:19:13.040
but you look sexy when you're angry!

264
00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:26.780
I thought I had seen it all...

265
00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:28.679
with my previous DJs,

266
00:19:29.119 --> 00:19:31.990
but a top star is beyond my imagination.

267
00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:35.790
I need to build my skills.

268
00:19:57.479 --> 00:19:59.750
Hey, why do you look so dazed?

269
00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:01.119
What is that?

270
00:20:02.649 --> 00:20:04.990
- Mr. Lee. - Will he do it?

271
00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:09.189
He said yes, but...

272
00:20:09.189 --> 00:20:11.260
What is it? Did he abuse his power?

273
00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:14.000
Does he want control over the script and guest?

274
00:20:14.199 --> 00:20:16.330
- How did you know? - He declined live shows?

275
00:20:16.369 --> 00:20:17.429
What?

276
00:20:18.129 --> 00:20:19.429
How did you know?

277
00:20:19.469 --> 00:20:21.800
I've done radio shows for years.

278
00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:23.570
Let me see it.

279
00:20:25.209 --> 00:20:27.040
What do we do?

280
00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.209
(Contract)

281
00:20:31.879 --> 00:20:33.580
(Radio DJ Contract)

282
00:20:34.879 --> 00:20:36.990
It's okay. Just tell him to sign.

283
00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:37.990
Sorry?

284
00:20:38.449 --> 00:20:40.860
Tell him to come and sign the contract.

285
00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:42.119
Really?

286
00:20:42.119 --> 00:20:44.229
- Isn't our show live? - It is.

287
00:20:44.229 --> 00:20:45.860
What if Ji Soo Ho...

288
00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:48.060
says he'll do it, but gives an attitude later?

289
00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:49.800
I'm Lee Gang.

290
00:20:53.899 --> 00:20:54.969
But seriously,

291
00:20:55.369 --> 00:20:57.510
how did you win Ji Soo Ho over?

292
00:20:58.439 --> 00:21:00.209
You really are gifted at that.

293
00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:03.750
Don't worry.

294
00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:05.750
You brought Ji Soo Ho,

295
00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:07.080
so you're my main writer.

296
00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:14.959
I won't do a daily show.

297
00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:16.860
Hey.

298
00:21:17.459 --> 00:21:18.459
Are you...

299
00:21:18.889 --> 00:21:21.399
saying you won't do a daily show?

300
00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.969
A daily will fail.

301
00:21:24.169 --> 00:21:27.000
It's best to do two shows in its time slot.

302
00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:30.540
Along with Seung Soo and La Hee.

303
00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:33.280
Our two teams can share nicely.

304
00:21:34.479 --> 00:21:35.479
You do three days,

305
00:21:35.479 --> 00:21:36.679
and we do three days.

306
00:21:36.679 --> 00:21:38.610
The one with higher ratings get Sunday.

307
00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:39.610
How's that?

308
00:21:41.179 --> 00:21:42.479
I mean,

309
00:21:42.649 --> 00:21:44.649
Rather than struggling every day,

310
00:21:44.649 --> 00:21:47.159
let's do it right, even if it's only one day,

311
00:21:47.159 --> 00:21:49.060
and prepare properly.

312
00:21:50.689 --> 00:21:54.330
Do you mean the programs should battle?

313
00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:57.570
Exactly. We can call it that too.

314
00:21:57.899 --> 00:22:00.399
The media market has changed.

315
00:22:00.399 --> 00:22:02.100
If there's a reason why radio is failing,

316
00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:04.110
we should follow the reason it'll succeed.

317
00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:06.270
Why is radio failing?

318
00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:08.280
Because we never tried anything.

319
00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:09.780
We never challenged ourselves.

320
00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:11.550
That's why it's failing.

321
00:22:17.649 --> 00:22:18.689
Let's do it.

322
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000
You jerk. What was that?

323
00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:32.600
What? Battle?

324
00:22:34.969 --> 00:22:37.040
Namaste. Greetings first.

325
00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:39.740
Don't give me "Namaste," you punk.

326
00:22:39.909 --> 00:22:41.010
Why?

327
00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:42.939
Why are you angry?

328
00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:45.080
I just don't understand.

329
00:22:48.219 --> 00:22:50.219
You must think I'm below you,

330
00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:53.389
and want to bring me in as your gopher, but...

331
00:22:56.119 --> 00:22:57.490
Look, classmate.

332
00:22:58.490 --> 00:22:59.490
Well...

333
00:23:00.129 --> 00:23:01.830
You aren't my gopher.

334
00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:05.600
I'm proposing we put forth a respectful competition.

335
00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:07.570
You were fired anyway.

336
00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:13.310
You should beat me...

337
00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:16.679
with your radio show at least once.

338
00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:18.110
Right?

339
00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:05.429
Listen carefully.

340
00:24:06.399 --> 00:24:08.000
Next time, this sword...

341
00:24:09.669 --> 00:24:11.570
will not stop here.

342
00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:14.840
This is my last warning.

343
00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:35.389
What was that?

344
00:24:37.659 --> 00:24:39.330
This is ridiculous.

345
00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:41.060
Should I call reporters here?

346
00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:42.300
Are you insane?

347
00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:44.399
Then I'll call the police.

348
00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:46.030
What?

349
00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:47.869
If you do this again,

350
00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:49.909
I'll kill you for real.

351
00:24:59.449 --> 00:25:00.449
Cut!

352
00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:15.729
- Thank you. - Soo Ho.

353
00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:18.570
You were shooting lasers out of your eyes.

354
00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:20.699
You have an incredible presence.

355
00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:22.969
- Let's watch that. - Okay.

356
00:25:28.709 --> 00:25:30.449
1. No live shows.

357
00:25:30.449 --> 00:25:32.479
Only prerecorded shows.

358
00:25:32.709 --> 00:25:35.520
Recordings have their own merit.

359
00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:36.649
It's stable,

360
00:25:36.649 --> 00:25:38.389
and good for your mental health.

361
00:25:39.689 --> 00:25:41.459
2. Ji Soo Ho has authority over...

362
00:25:41.459 --> 00:25:43.729
events, the writing, and guests.

363
00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:45.290
Ji Soo Ho is a top star,

364
00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:47.060
so the guests will also be top stars.

365
00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:48.929
This is awesome for us.

366
00:25:50.429 --> 00:25:53.270
3. Ji Soo Ho may quit...

367
00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:54.300
whenever he wants.

368
00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:56.810
We can make sure he never wants to quit.

369
00:25:56.810 --> 00:25:59.570
It'll be motivation to work hard.

370
00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:02.080
4. Song Geu Rim cannot refuse...

371
00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:03.679
anything Ji Soo Ho says.

372
00:26:03.709 --> 00:26:05.649
I can just listen carefully.

373
00:26:05.649 --> 00:26:09.250
Listening is critical in a relationship.

374
00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:11.990
Okay.

375
00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:24.770
Who could this be?

376
00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:26.369
Hello.

377
00:26:26.469 --> 00:26:28.899
I'm Song Geu Rim, a radio writer.

378
00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:33.810
This is Lady Kamikaze's phone number.

379
00:26:34.179 --> 00:26:36.350
If you're calling me...

380
00:26:36.479 --> 00:26:39.550
Yes, I'm calling about Ji Soo Ho's contract.

381
00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:41.580
After discussing it with the production director,

382
00:26:41.719 --> 00:26:44.949
we agreed to proceed with the terms he requested.

383
00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:48.119
If you'd let me know when he's free,

384
00:26:48.119 --> 00:26:50.090
I'll report to the station manager,

385
00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:51.629
and he can just come to the station...

386
00:26:51.629 --> 00:26:53.530
and sign the contract.

387
00:26:53.530 --> 00:26:55.300
I see. Okay.

388
00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:58.570
I'll relay the message to Soo Ho.

389
00:26:58.570 --> 00:26:59.669
Okay.

390
00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:22.189
Let me use your phone.

391
00:27:22.689 --> 00:27:23.689
And if I do?

392
00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:25.990
- Agree to do a session. - Hurry.

393
00:27:30.729 --> 00:27:32.399
I want the planning manager and writers...

394
00:27:32.399 --> 00:27:33.899
at the meeting tomorrow as well.

395
00:27:34.139 --> 00:27:36.240
Please review the data I requested.

396
00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:37.770
Okay.

397
00:27:46.919 --> 00:27:48.149
Lee Gang.

398
00:27:48.149 --> 00:27:49.649
He's 34 years old.

399
00:27:50.149 --> 00:27:52.320
He's a legend in the radio world.

400
00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:54.490
Everything he produces is number one in ratings.

401
00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:56.729
He won the best program award...

402
00:27:56.729 --> 00:27:58.659
in 2011 and 2013.

403
00:27:58.659 --> 00:28:01.600
He's known to have a terrible temper,

404
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.169
so he was forced to take a 2-year sabbatical...

405
00:28:04.169 --> 00:28:06.500
and recently returned from India.

406
00:28:06.699 --> 00:28:08.669
That's why we can't figure out...

407
00:28:08.669 --> 00:28:10.510
what the program will be like,

408
00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:12.869
and how we should write...

409
00:28:12.869 --> 00:28:14.510
your lines.

410
00:28:14.939 --> 00:28:15.939
Next.

411
00:28:15.939 --> 00:28:17.909
She's been an assistant writer for four years.

412
00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:21.479
There's no sample of Song Geu Rim's writing,

413
00:28:21.719 --> 00:28:23.090
so we couldn't find anything.

414
00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:25.290
She's famous for getting guests on her show,

415
00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:27.790
such as Song Hye Gyo, Sohn Suk Hee,

416
00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:29.689
and Kim Soo Hyun.

417
00:28:29.689 --> 00:28:33.300
That's why we don't know what she'd write,

418
00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:36.129
and what we should write for your script.

419
00:28:36.129 --> 00:28:37.570
It's difficult to tell.

420
00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:39.969
I'll listen to the rest when I get back.

421
00:28:40.439 --> 00:28:41.639
I'll do the radio show...

422
00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:44.040
with the script you write.

423
00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:45.810
So please start preparing.

424
00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:46.810
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

425
00:28:57.219 --> 00:28:58.320
Ms. Nam...

426
00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:00.760
would like to see you before you go.

427
00:29:16.369 --> 00:29:17.369
Ms. Nam.

428
00:29:17.639 --> 00:29:20.209
Please put me in as Soo Ho's radio show guest.

429
00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:22.040
What do you mean?

430
00:29:23.479 --> 00:29:25.550
You always ask...

431
00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:26.949
when you understood.

432
00:29:26.949 --> 00:29:28.350
It's so lame.

433
00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:29.850
You're not fooling anyone.

434
00:29:31.689 --> 00:29:35.659
He and I won acting awards together as children.

435
00:29:35.919 --> 00:29:38.260
It's not so bad to have a 10-year reunion...

436
00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:39.760
on the radio.

437
00:29:41.699 --> 00:29:44.800
You'll tie us together and write...

438
00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:46.969
many articles about us, won't you?

439
00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:50.840
I brought this photo to you first.

440
00:29:51.139 --> 00:29:53.709
I'm very loyal, you know.

441
00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:58.209
So you should also show me...

442
00:29:58.250 --> 00:30:00.850
some loyalty, don't you think?

443
00:30:03.119 --> 00:30:04.689
Who's backing you?

444
00:30:05.919 --> 00:30:08.290
What do you mean? Don't be silly.

445
00:30:09.119 --> 00:30:10.629
It's just that...

446
00:30:10.729 --> 00:30:12.290
when I go somewhere to eat,

447
00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:14.159
they always come to eat there.

448
00:30:14.159 --> 00:30:16.000
When I go shopping,

449
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.030
Da Seul always comes to shop.

450
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.040
But your husband...

451
00:30:21.199 --> 00:30:23.169
always pays.

452
00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:25.040
That's how I found out.

453
00:30:27.939 --> 00:30:30.350
Is doing radio with him all you want?

454
00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:33.449
Come on. Naturally, that won't suffice.

455
00:30:35.879 --> 00:30:38.219
That's just the start.

456
00:30:41.459 --> 00:30:42.919
I'll get going now.

457
00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:56.610
Hi.

458
00:30:58.369 --> 00:31:01.679
When someone says, "Hi," you should say, "Hi" back.

459
00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:03.979
We'll be seeing each other often.

460
00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:11.419
Hi to you too.

461
00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:15.889
Hey. Seriously. Say, "Hi," will you?

462
00:31:17.189 --> 00:31:20.159
Both the star and the manager ignore me.

463
00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:28.340
Hey, Mister.

464
00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:31.840
Can you do something for me?

465
00:31:32.139 --> 00:31:34.010
It's a lame line, I know,

466
00:31:35.179 --> 00:31:37.610
but for old times' sake.

467
00:31:42.119 --> 00:31:43.550
A radio show?

468
00:31:44.449 --> 00:31:47.090
Really? You won't regret it?

469
00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:49.159
I may.

470
00:31:50.389 --> 00:31:51.659
Try it.

471
00:31:52.189 --> 00:31:53.959
You should try what you want to do.

472
00:31:57.169 --> 00:32:00.199
Now, we'll move onto business.

473
00:32:00.869 --> 00:32:03.169
I respected your choice,

474
00:32:03.439 --> 00:32:05.909
so please respect mine.

475
00:32:06.270 --> 00:32:09.110
Give-and-take is a given in business.

476
00:32:09.879 --> 00:32:12.479
Must I really do that movie?

477
00:32:19.919 --> 00:32:21.260
You know, right?

478
00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:26.500
You have a responsibility for what you choose.

479
00:32:27.129 --> 00:32:29.100
And that countless lives...

480
00:32:29.429 --> 00:32:31.899
depend on what you choose.

481
00:32:36.669 --> 00:32:38.709
- You're right. - So?

482
00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:41.139
If it is as you say,

483
00:32:41.139 --> 00:32:43.979
countless lives depend on my one decision.

484
00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:46.979
Then I must do the radio show.

485

486
00:33:18.550 --> 00:33:20.419
Hello.

487
00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:22.179
Hello, Soo Ho.

488
00:33:22.449 --> 00:33:24.090
Hello, Geu Rim. How have you been?

489
00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:26.490
Well, thanks to you.

490
00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:29.560
Let's go.

491
00:33:57.919 --> 00:33:59.290
Weight limit exceeded.

492
00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:02.219
Weight limit exceeded.

493
00:34:04.090 --> 00:34:05.260
Weight limit exceeded.

494
00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:06.699
I will get off.

495
00:34:06.699 --> 00:34:08.200
No, I'll get off.

496
00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:09.800
No, I'll get off.

497
00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:19.610
It's Ji Soo Ho!

498
00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:42.459
Here we are.

499
00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:45.300
The station manager, GM, and the executives...

500
00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:47.140
are all here.

501
00:34:47.140 --> 00:34:48.200
Really?

502
00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:51.269
Yes. The station manager for variety shows...

503
00:34:51.269 --> 00:34:52.939
and dramas is also here.

504
00:34:54.209 --> 00:34:55.209
Let's go in.

505
00:34:55.579 --> 00:34:56.649
Okay.

506
00:34:56.749 --> 00:34:57.849
I'll wait in the lobby.

507
00:34:59.079 --> 00:35:00.220
Where are you going?

508
00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:02.649
- Hey, Mr. Kim... - Come on.

509
00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:05.090
I need to work. Why...

510
00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:07.519
Mr. Kang, Ji Soo Ho is here.

511
00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:16.800
Thank you for coming.

512
00:35:17.399 --> 00:35:20.439
I look forward to working with you.

513
00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:33.680
Okay, Soo Ho,

514
00:35:34.379 --> 00:35:37.720
I know these are just formalities,

515
00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:40.490
but let's sign the contract...

516
00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:42.490
and enjoy lunch together,

517
00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:44.860
talking about the progress and future...

518
00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:46.559
- about our radio... - I'd like to...

519
00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:49.559
sign it alone with Song Geu Rim.

520
00:35:50.970 --> 00:35:53.099
I was touched by her endless passion...

521
00:35:53.099 --> 00:35:56.370
and love for the radio, which is why I agreed.

522
00:35:56.539 --> 00:36:00.140
That is why I'd like to sign alone with her.

523
00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:05.450
Sure. Okay.

524
00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:11.090
Go.

525
00:36:22.099 --> 00:36:23.169
Is this...

526
00:36:23.329 --> 00:36:25.129
Yes, the writer's office.

527
00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:33.209
I plan to clean and redecorate.

528
00:36:33.379 --> 00:36:35.180
By the time you come,

529
00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:36.680
it'll be completely...

530
00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:37.809
I'd like the monthly,

531
00:36:37.809 --> 00:36:39.979
weekly and daily plans for the program,

532
00:36:40.149 --> 00:36:42.280
and the script one week in advance.

533
00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:44.590
Pardon?

534
00:36:45.249 --> 00:36:46.360
But...

535
00:36:47.090 --> 00:36:49.660
radio shows don't work that way...

536
00:36:49.729 --> 00:36:50.789
You can't do it?

537
00:36:51.329 --> 00:36:53.700
Will you refuse to do it if we can't?

538
00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:56.059
If you look at item four of the Geu Rim contract,

539
00:36:56.059 --> 00:36:58.769
you cannot refuse anything I say, correct?

540
00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:00.999
The "Geu Rim contract"?

541
00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:03.269
You agreed to proceed with that contract.

542
00:37:03.709 --> 00:37:05.439
I trusted you...

543
00:37:05.439 --> 00:37:08.039
and came to sign that contract.

544
00:37:08.439 --> 00:37:10.110
Excuse me, Soo Ho.

545
00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:12.879
Are you threatening me again?

546
00:37:12.979 --> 00:37:14.450
It's not a threat.

547
00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:16.990
How could these words with this expression...

548
00:37:16.990 --> 00:37:18.090
be a threat?

549
00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:22.789
I'm asking you, not threatening you.

550
00:37:23.189 --> 00:37:25.729
I am unfamiliar with the radio,

551
00:37:25.959 --> 00:37:27.629
and as you know,

552
00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:30.669
there are many people who monitor what I say and do.

553
00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:33.340
Sure.

554
00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:36.410
I didn't think that far.

555
00:37:36.769 --> 00:37:39.070
That is why I need your help.

556
00:37:39.309 --> 00:37:42.439
If you agree, shall we sign?

557
00:37:44.079 --> 00:37:45.249
Sure.

558
00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:49.050
(Contract)

559
00:37:49.050 --> 00:37:50.849
(Ji Soo Ho, Song Geu Rim)

560
00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:54.990
(Ji Soo Ho, Song Geu Rim)

561
00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:56.959
(Ji Soo Ho, Song Geu Rim)

562
00:38:08.499 --> 00:38:11.610
I promise to clean the room well.

563
00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:15.610
I'll go now.

564
00:38:23.789 --> 00:38:24.849
Namaste.

565
00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:26.760
I'm Lee Gang.

566
00:38:29.090 --> 00:38:30.129
I'm Ji Soo Ho.

567
00:38:30.430 --> 00:38:31.660
I'm production director.

568
00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:32.789
I'm Ji Soo Ho.

569
00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:36.769
Trust me.

570
00:38:36.999 --> 00:38:39.570
I won two broadcasting awards.

571
00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:41.999
I'm Ji Soo Ho.

572
00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:50.879
What are you doing this weekend?

573
00:38:50.879 --> 00:38:53.780
- What? - Can you make some time?

574
00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:57.289
Our writer,

575
00:38:58.450 --> 00:38:59.590
the production director,

576
00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:01.720
and the DJ should discuss the show.

577
00:39:07.459 --> 00:39:09.899
My apologies, but it'll be difficult.

578
00:39:10.269 --> 00:39:11.999
Once you have the plan and direction,

579
00:39:11.999 --> 00:39:13.340
please call my agency.

580
00:39:24.410 --> 00:39:25.809
It's so cold.

581
00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:28.979
Excuse me, Soo Ho.

582
00:39:29.789 --> 00:39:30.789
Well...

583
00:39:31.919 --> 00:39:35.059
Well, I didn't get to say something.

584
00:39:36.930 --> 00:39:38.090
Thank you.

585
00:39:38.090 --> 00:39:40.059
And I look forward to working with you.

586
00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:43.499
I'll work hard and make sure you're happy...

587
00:39:43.499 --> 00:39:44.870
you're on the radio.

588
00:39:45.329 --> 00:39:48.200
I'll try to get you to love the radio.

589
00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:50.410
Thank you very much for believing in me...

590
00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:52.269
and choosing to go on the radio.

591
00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:11.459
Let me see the contract.

592
00:40:12.530 --> 00:40:14.760
- Pardon? - Let me see...

593
00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:16.370
what terms Ji Soo Ho and you agreed to.

594
00:40:18.629 --> 00:40:19.769
Well...

595
00:40:20.669 --> 00:40:22.269
They're just...

596
00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:25.870
Geu Rim. I heard we're battling.

597
00:40:26.209 --> 00:40:27.379
Did you know?

598
00:40:29.379 --> 00:40:31.649
I heard from Mr. Lee.

599
00:40:31.749 --> 00:40:33.280
You against me?

600
00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:36.590
Like you compare.

601
00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:40.789
Are you confident?

602
00:40:41.689 --> 00:40:42.990
Of course, not.

603
00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:44.760
I'll just try hard.

604
00:40:45.930 --> 00:40:47.800
I need to go...

605
00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:49.700
write my script.

606
00:41:02.379 --> 00:41:03.610
Want to be my AD?

607
00:41:06.579 --> 00:41:07.579
Will you do it?

608
00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:21.800
Will you do it?

609
00:41:25.370 --> 00:41:26.370
Wake up.

610
00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:29.140
- What? - Wake up!

611
00:41:33.610 --> 00:41:35.340
Why are you sleeping on that?

612
00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:40.050
They are my life's mentors.

613
00:41:41.019 --> 00:41:42.149
I want...

614
00:41:42.149 --> 00:41:44.320
to absorb their talent...

615
00:41:45.919 --> 00:41:48.189
They're your life's mentors?

616
00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:51.229
Yes. I'm sorry. I won't sleep on them...

617
00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:52.430
You pass.

618
00:41:52.959 --> 00:41:55.899
Pardon? What do you mean?

619
00:41:55.899 --> 00:41:57.129
Work with me.

620
00:41:57.129 --> 00:41:58.669
I'm sorry, sir.

621
00:41:58.669 --> 00:42:00.899
Hey!

622
00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:04.610
There's a reason why these shows failed.

623
00:42:04.610 --> 00:42:06.879
You know them from experience.

624
00:42:07.209 --> 00:42:09.950
First, don't copy other programs.

625
00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:12.479
Second, don't use music to fill the time.

626
00:42:12.479 --> 00:42:16.289
Third, don't ignore listeners' comments.

627
00:42:17.090 --> 00:42:19.220
And now, since we are on the same team,

628
00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:20.620
we need to know each other's lethal moves,

629
00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:22.789
in order to maximize his or her potential.

630
00:42:22.789 --> 00:42:24.090
So, you.

631
00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:25.530
You.

632
00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:27.360
What are your go-to lethal moves?

633
00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:37.970
I'll give you a week. Figure it out by then.

634
00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:39.439
Find it.

635
00:42:39.539 --> 00:42:40.539
What?

636
00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:42.809
- Lethal move. - Louder.

637
00:42:42.809 --> 00:42:43.910
- Lethal move. - Lethal move.

638
00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:45.280
Lethal move!

639
00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:47.919
You little punk.

640
00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:49.450
- I'm sorry. - Is this a joke?

641
00:42:49.450 --> 00:42:50.550
I'm sorry.

642
00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:53.720
Do you have a dog?

643
00:42:53.919 --> 00:42:55.660
Yes, I do.

644
00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:57.360
I see.

645
00:42:57.829 --> 00:42:59.729
What is the capital of India?

646
00:43:00.930 --> 00:43:02.229
Namaste.

647
00:43:03.829 --> 00:43:05.629
What's the longest you've gone without washing?

648
00:43:07.970 --> 00:43:09.300
Thank you.

649
00:43:12.910 --> 00:43:14.680
Here, I wrote this.

650
00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:16.579
Please take a look.

651
00:43:17.079 --> 00:43:18.680
Do you have a dog?

652
00:43:18.809 --> 00:43:20.280
No, I don't.

653
00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:23.789
Pass.

654
00:43:24.349 --> 00:43:25.919
Can you start tomorrow?

655
00:43:25.919 --> 00:43:28.320
Yes. I'll do my best.

656
00:43:30.559 --> 00:43:31.789
Let's toast.

657
00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:34.229
You.

658
00:43:34.899 --> 00:43:36.829
I did choose you as my assistant director,

659
00:43:36.829 --> 00:43:38.169
but you only know "sorry."

660
00:43:38.169 --> 00:43:39.939
Your reflexes are slow, right?

661
00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:41.740
You can't fix things very well, right?

662
00:43:42.499 --> 00:43:45.110
How am I supposed to trust you?

663
00:43:47.979 --> 00:43:49.579
Then you shouldn't have picked me.

664
00:43:51.450 --> 00:43:53.579
You're a terrible writer,

665
00:43:53.579 --> 00:43:54.720
but you're passionate...

666
00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:56.990
and cause trouble everywhere, right?

667
00:43:58.090 --> 00:43:59.890
How am I supposed to trust you?

668
00:43:59.890 --> 00:44:01.120
This is insane.

669
00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:03.729
Seriously.

670
00:44:03.729 --> 00:44:06.459
He says such sweet things.

671
00:44:08.729 --> 00:44:09.800
If you...

672
00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:12.329
don't work hard and slack off,

673
00:44:12.599 --> 00:44:14.599
what do I do?

674
00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:18.470
Mr. Lee, our arms hurt.

675
00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:20.280
Can we toast?

676
00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:23.550
We all have experience messing up big time,

677
00:44:23.550 --> 00:44:26.979
and a lady who killed her program.

678
00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:28.320
Look.

679
00:44:28.379 --> 00:44:30.720
It hurts enough already without you...

680
00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:32.450
repeating it.

681
00:44:32.789 --> 00:44:34.390
So let's all survive together.

682
00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:35.390
Okay?

683
00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:37.129
If you...

684
00:44:37.129 --> 00:44:39.530
can't do your part in my booth...

685
00:44:44.899 --> 00:44:48.140
I'll kill you with my bare hands.

686
00:44:48.269 --> 00:44:49.269
Okay?

687
00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:52.709
And finally,

688
00:44:52.939 --> 00:44:54.180
it's okay if we lose,

689
00:44:54.379 --> 00:44:56.180
but let's at least put up a good fight.

690
00:44:56.379 --> 00:44:57.450
Okay?

691
00:44:58.579 --> 00:44:59.979
Okay.

692
00:44:59.979 --> 00:45:01.149
- Okay. - Okay.

693
00:45:01.149 --> 00:45:03.020
- Here. - Cheers.

695
00:45:10.689 --> 00:45:13.629
Congratulations

696
00:45:13.629 --> 00:45:16.530
Congratulations on your promotion

697
00:45:17.729 --> 00:45:19.070
My Geu Rim.

698
00:45:19.070 --> 00:45:20.499
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

699
00:45:20.499 --> 00:45:22.169
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

700
00:45:22.169 --> 00:45:23.439
Good luck!

701
00:45:23.439 --> 00:45:24.740
Work hard.

702
00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:26.039
Thank you.

703
00:45:29.649 --> 00:45:31.209
- Mom. - Yes?

704
00:45:31.479 --> 00:45:34.180
It's a dark, starless night.

705
00:45:34.479 --> 00:45:36.419
But there's a full moon.

706
00:45:36.689 --> 00:45:38.450
It's as big as my face.

707
00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:42.419
It must be really small then.

708
00:45:42.590 --> 00:45:44.829
Gosh, Mom.

709
00:45:45.629 --> 00:45:48.629
I admit. I do have a small face.

710
00:45:52.570 --> 00:45:55.740
How do you feel, Ms. Song Geu Rim?

711
00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:56.740
What?

712
00:45:57.410 --> 00:45:59.879
It's been your only dream through middle school,

713
00:45:59.879 --> 00:46:02.180
high school, and college...

714
00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:04.050
to become a radio writer.

715
00:46:06.450 --> 00:46:08.550
I'm not sure yet.

716
00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:10.349
It hasn't hit me yet.

717
00:46:12.590 --> 00:46:15.720
But Mom, I'm going to work really hard.

718
00:46:16.430 --> 00:46:18.530
I'll work super hard to make a radio show...

719
00:46:18.530 --> 00:46:21.160
that you will listen to every day.

720
00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:22.899
Really?

721
00:46:22.899 --> 00:46:27.399
Then I'll work super hard to listen.

722
00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:53.559
Hello?

723
00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:56.260
Yes, speaking.

724
00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:01.939
Who?

725
00:47:32.499 --> 00:47:33.669
What is...

726
00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:36.809
JH has its own contracts, you see.

727
00:47:37.370 --> 00:47:39.470
Please read it through and sign it.

(Authority)

731
00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:54.120
His schedule is packed until late next year.

732
00:47:54.519 --> 00:47:56.090
Two hours a day...

733
00:47:56.090 --> 00:47:58.459
is too burdensome for him. Still,

734
00:47:58.829 --> 00:48:01.459
since he insists on doing it,

735
00:48:01.459 --> 00:48:05.030
we'll do whatever we can to support him.

736
00:48:06.539 --> 00:48:08.140
If you'd send over the scripts...

737
00:48:08.599 --> 00:48:10.510
Do I need approval?

738
00:48:10.510 --> 00:48:12.209
We need to inspect them.

739
00:48:20.019 --> 00:48:21.879
I can be here, right?

740
00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:23.620
I mean,

741
00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:25.890
what contract are you entering into without me?

742
00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:30.059
Send the script only to me.

743
00:48:34.030 --> 00:48:35.160
We'd like to inspect...

744
00:48:35.399 --> 00:48:37.499
the guests you'll have on the show as well.

745
00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:42.939
Yes, ma'am, that's already in his contract.

746
00:48:42.939 --> 00:48:45.110
You only need my consent for that as well.

747
00:48:51.149 --> 00:48:53.579
What is your representative work?

748
00:48:53.979 --> 00:48:56.050
Have you won awards for writing?

749
00:48:58.320 --> 00:48:59.390
Not yet.

750
00:49:01.789 --> 00:49:03.729
As his agency,

751
00:49:03.729 --> 00:49:05.559
that is a big concern.

752
00:49:06.059 --> 00:49:09.160
What if people talk about you dating,

753
00:49:09.599 --> 00:49:12.399
just because you're alone in the booth together?

754
00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:16.039
I'm also concerned...

755
00:49:16.039 --> 00:49:18.410
that I'll see you again in my son's house...

756
00:49:18.709 --> 00:49:20.309
like last time.

757
00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:26.849
That will never happen.

758
00:49:26.849 --> 00:49:28.249
Never. Never.

759
00:49:28.519 --> 00:49:30.950
That was a misunderstanding too.

760
00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:34.360
That will never ever happen with Soo Ho.

761
00:49:34.990 --> 00:49:37.890
The reason I'm adding the "ever" is,

762
00:49:40.059 --> 00:49:41.660
it's Ji Soo Ho.

763
00:49:43.070 --> 00:49:45.300
- What do you... - I can promise.

764
00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:48.499
I will never fall for someone like him.

765
00:49:48.499 --> 00:49:49.570
Never.

766
00:49:51.610 --> 00:49:54.410
And what kind of a person would that be?

767
00:49:56.010 --> 00:49:57.180
He is...

768
00:49:57.280 --> 00:50:00.320
the complete opposite of me.

769
00:50:02.579 --> 00:50:05.349
So you don't need to worry about that.

770
00:50:06.519 --> 00:50:09.519
Okay. I'll get going then.

771
00:50:09.519 --> 00:50:11.729
I'll discuss the contract with my boss.

772
00:50:11.729 --> 00:50:13.729
Thank you. Bye.

773
00:50:23.870 --> 00:50:25.840
You'll go? Really?

774
00:50:26.010 --> 00:50:27.209
And if not?

775
00:50:27.479 --> 00:50:29.240
You'll really sell chicken?

776
00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:32.280
I can go elsewhere as a freelancer,

777
00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:34.019
but I feel sorry for you.

778
00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:36.019
Let's have some respect.

779
00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:39.660
Ji Soo Ho is their DJ. What can we do?

780
00:50:40.590 --> 00:50:42.059
So what?

781
00:50:42.590 --> 00:50:43.760
What about It?

782
00:50:45.789 --> 00:50:47.629
Lee Gang intimidates you.

783
00:50:47.629 --> 00:50:50.470
You're the same year, but you always lost.

784
00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:54.640
How can you do a show without Geu Rim?

785
00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:57.740
Your guests can't carry you anymore.

786
00:50:58.110 --> 00:50:59.370
Let's stop.

787
00:51:02.809 --> 00:51:05.649
I refuse to let Geu Rim beat me.

788
00:51:05.879 --> 00:51:08.079
You'd better do it right this time.

789
00:51:09.919 --> 00:51:13.160
You won't let me lose to Gang, right?

790
00:51:13.459 --> 00:51:14.519
Right?

791
00:51:16.930 --> 00:51:19.999
Don't you ever think about doing a good job yourself?

792
00:51:30.269 --> 00:51:33.809
(Contract)

793
00:51:39.079 --> 00:51:40.979
No!

794
00:51:41.579 --> 00:51:44.320
This makes no sense!

795
00:51:44.550 --> 00:51:48.189
How could you lend me the land for a month?

796
00:51:48.220 --> 00:51:51.059
How can I farm the land?

797
00:51:51.629 --> 00:51:54.959
I need time to plant the seeds, let it sprout,

798
00:51:55.129 --> 00:51:58.729
and give it fertilizer and sunlight.

799
00:52:00.099 --> 00:52:02.470
How can I do it in a month?

800
00:52:02.939 --> 00:52:04.570
That is not my problem.

801
00:52:04.809 --> 00:52:07.809
If you still want to borrow the land, fine.

802
00:52:08.709 --> 00:52:09.749
If not, scram.

803
00:52:12.010 --> 00:52:13.749
My lord.

804
00:52:13.749 --> 00:52:16.820
I must inspect your skill. I will cut rice cakes,

805
00:52:17.149 --> 00:52:19.550
you write while I do.

806
00:52:24.590 --> 00:52:26.629
You must write 100, no, 1,000 pages...

807
00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:28.629
until your script...

808
00:52:28.629 --> 00:52:30.729
passes my inspection!

809
00:52:38.910 --> 00:52:40.610
Fail!

810
00:52:41.879 --> 00:52:43.550
Fail!

811
00:52:47.450 --> 00:52:50.419
(Contract)

812
00:52:58.189 --> 00:52:59.459

815
00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:07.640
No!

816
00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:14.240
What are you doing?

817
00:53:24.289 --> 00:53:25.990
Why do you have so much...

818
00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:28.820
Mr. Lee.

819
00:53:29.390 --> 00:53:32.030
Have you been sleeping here this entire time?

820
00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:33.059
Yes.

821
00:53:33.059 --> 00:53:35.260
I didn't have a home when I returned from India.

822
00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:37.629
Did you find a place?

823
00:53:37.629 --> 00:53:39.570
Yes. See you later.

824
00:53:40.970 --> 00:53:41.970
Later?

825
00:53:43.610 --> 00:53:45.470
Should I just wait and not go home?

826
00:53:45.470 --> 00:53:47.140
I need to learn how to write scripts.

827
00:53:47.539 --> 00:53:49.610
No. Go home.

828
00:53:49.780 --> 00:53:51.849
I'll teach you like crazy starting today.

829
00:53:52.110 --> 00:53:55.349
We should show those jerks who disrespected us.

830
00:53:56.249 --> 00:53:58.419
What? Starting today?

831
00:53:59.660 --> 00:54:01.660
Are you coming back here tonight?

832
00:54:02.419 --> 00:54:03.530
Bye.

833
00:54:05.090 --> 00:54:06.090
What the...

834
00:54:33.390 --> 00:54:36.260
Excuse me. Mr. Lee?

835
00:54:36.959 --> 00:54:38.930
Why are you...

836
00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:41.329
- I live here. - Since when?

837
00:54:41.660 --> 00:54:42.760
Since today.

838
00:54:45.269 --> 00:54:46.740
Let's be together 24 hours a day.

839
00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:48.399
We'll come up with something then.

840
00:54:48.399 --> 00:54:49.470
We have no time.

841
00:54:49.769 --> 00:54:51.970
The concept is, since we have no time,

842
00:54:51.970 --> 00:54:55.539
the writer and PD spends 24 hours a day together.

843
00:54:55.539 --> 00:54:56.680
Ta-da.

844
00:54:57.809 --> 00:54:58.979
Well...

845
00:55:00.050 --> 00:55:01.479
But this...

846
00:55:01.479 --> 00:55:03.950
Do you hate being with me 24 hours a day that much?

847
00:55:04.450 --> 00:55:05.490
Sorry?

848
00:55:05.550 --> 00:55:09.160
Are you annoyed because I order you around?

849
00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:13.229
You're a writer. You know that, right?

850
00:55:15.399 --> 00:55:18.800
Do you think listeners' stories are garbage?

851
00:55:19.399 --> 00:55:21.800
How many times did I tell you to pretend...

852
00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:24.870
they are cries for help from your mom and sibling?

853
00:55:25.410 --> 00:55:27.010
I said to read it thoughtfully.

854
00:55:27.010 --> 00:55:28.780
Why do you always just skim it?

855
00:55:29.439 --> 00:55:32.349
Mr. Lee. Please watch what you say.

856
00:55:32.349 --> 00:55:35.050
You need to stop writing garbage.

857
00:55:35.450 --> 00:55:38.220
Why is everything pieces of other shows?

858
00:55:39.249 --> 00:55:42.360
Do you want to make trash by copying others?

859
00:55:44.059 --> 00:55:45.129
Newbie.

860
00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:48.599
- Yes? - I said you're a writer.

861
00:55:49.099 --> 00:55:51.399
When will you write if you only run errands?

862
00:55:52.769 --> 00:55:55.669
If I see you delivering food again, you're dead.

863
00:55:56.039 --> 00:55:57.340
You're a writer too.

864
00:55:59.439 --> 00:56:02.680
The first person who called me a writer.

865
00:56:03.709 --> 00:56:04.809
Call...

866
00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:07.079
Ji Soo Ho.

867
00:56:08.019 --> 00:56:09.079
Pardon?

868
00:56:10.149 --> 00:56:11.890
Aren't you going to prepare a plan?

869
00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:14.120
If he says he's busy,

870
00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:16.990
will you just sit around and wait?

871
00:56:17.229 --> 00:56:20.399
He signed a contract, so we should use him.

872
00:56:20.399 --> 00:56:22.760
Who? Our DJ.

873
00:56:23.769 --> 00:56:27.370
What? The contract that says Ji Soo Ho...

874
00:56:27.370 --> 00:56:28.499
has all authority?

875
00:56:30.140 --> 00:56:33.140
I heard his calendar was full this week.

876
00:56:33.309 --> 00:56:34.479
- Really? - Yes.

877
00:56:34.479 --> 00:56:37.149
Then we'll go since we have nothing.

878
00:56:37.349 --> 00:56:38.680
Where are his plans?

879
00:56:39.050 --> 00:56:41.050
- Should I call? - Yes.

880
00:56:41.919 --> 00:56:43.590
But he doesn't own a phone.

881
00:56:43.689 --> 00:56:46.620
Are you messing with me? Then what?

882
00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:51.629
(Lady Kamikaze)

883
00:56:51.629 --> 00:56:53.530
He's working out right now.

884
00:56:54.729 --> 00:56:57.300
When will he be done?

885
00:56:58.669 --> 00:57:00.700
He should be done soon.

886
00:57:01.370 --> 00:57:03.340
Then I'll call in half an hour.

887
00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:04.769
Let me talk to him then.

888
00:57:05.209 --> 00:57:06.439
Sure.

889
00:57:35.499 --> 00:57:36.510
Who is it?

890
00:57:36.709 --> 00:57:38.740
Who else would call you through me?

891
00:57:43.209 --> 00:57:44.280
Hello?

892
00:57:45.349 --> 00:57:47.419
- Nagasaki. Thank you. - Enjoy.

893
00:57:47.419 --> 00:57:49.579
Hi, Soo Ho. Hello.

894
00:57:50.050 --> 00:57:53.059
When will you ever get a cell phone?

895
00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:57.430
It's not like I'm crossing the DMZ to talk to you.

896
00:57:57.530 --> 00:57:59.899
I always have to consult your manager, so...

897
00:58:02.260 --> 00:58:04.399
That's not bad, but...

898
00:58:06.539 --> 00:58:08.939
Hello? Soo Ho?

899
00:58:10.110 --> 00:58:11.240
Go ahead.

900
00:58:11.510 --> 00:58:13.439
I'm calling because...

901
00:58:13.610 --> 00:58:16.879
Mr. Lee would like to meet for a planning meeting...

902
00:58:17.010 --> 00:58:18.950
if you have time.

903
00:58:24.789 --> 00:58:27.720
Hello? Soo Ho? Do you hear me?

904
00:58:29.629 --> 00:58:30.660
Yes.

905
00:58:31.559 --> 00:58:33.329
Are you free?

906
00:58:33.459 --> 00:58:36.499
No. I have plans now and a shoot tomorrow...

907
00:58:36.629 --> 00:58:39.030
That's not true. He's free now and tomorrow.

908
00:58:39.499 --> 00:58:42.140
He showered and changed into comfortable clothes.

909
00:58:43.370 --> 00:58:46.070
Geu Rim, I can't go today, so...

910
00:58:48.010 --> 00:58:50.950
Soo Ho. Let's not do this. We're both pros.

911
00:58:51.110 --> 00:58:54.149
You're a pro, so I know you understand.

912
00:58:54.550 --> 00:58:56.890
If you signed the contract,

913
00:58:57.019 --> 00:58:59.090
you must've had...

914
00:58:59.090 --> 00:59:02.660
the mindset of a pro to produce a good show.

915
00:59:03.430 --> 00:59:06.629
But you don't seem like a pro at all now.

916
00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:10.729
What do you mean?

917
00:59:10.899 --> 00:59:12.729
The thing with the radio is,

918
00:59:13.300 --> 00:59:15.599
the DJ can't make the show all by himself.

919
00:59:15.599 --> 00:59:18.669
But neither can the writer or production director.

920
00:59:19.010 --> 00:59:21.879
If you won't discuss openly with us,

921
00:59:21.879 --> 00:59:23.849
we can't do anything.

922
00:59:24.309 --> 00:59:25.950
My agency will call...

923
00:59:25.950 --> 00:59:27.649
Forget the agency.

924
00:59:28.019 --> 00:59:30.349
What will you do if our program fails...

925
00:59:30.349 --> 00:59:32.289
because of you?

926
00:59:33.059 --> 00:59:34.720
Are you an amateur?

927
00:59:34.959 --> 00:59:37.390
Do you do everything halfheartedly like this?

928
00:59:39.059 --> 00:59:40.260
Where are you?

929
00:59:43.030 --> 00:59:44.099
Here.

930
00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:46.599
- Mr. Lee. - Tell him the address.

931
00:59:59.309 --> 01:00:03.789
(Art Gallery)

932
01:00:09.930 --> 01:00:11.229
Take a seat.

933
01:00:14.399 --> 01:00:17.829
So? What do you want to do here at this hour?

934
01:00:18.530 --> 01:00:19.740
Namaste.

935
01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:23.110
I wanted to see your face,

936
01:00:23.110 --> 01:00:24.809
so I was a bit rude.

937
01:00:25.039 --> 01:00:26.539
I didn't know you'd come right away.

938
01:00:26.539 --> 01:00:29.209
- You told me to come. - Exactly.

939
01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:31.709
Because you're a pro.

940
01:00:32.410 --> 01:00:35.050
I'll hope you are a pro as well.

941
01:00:35.079 --> 01:00:36.079
Anytime.

942
01:00:38.289 --> 01:00:40.990
I've never been out at this hour before.

943
01:00:41.090 --> 01:00:42.090
Why not?

944
01:00:44.459 --> 01:00:46.959
Do you get lost if you go out?

945
01:00:46.959 --> 01:00:50.329
Does lightning and thunder come at you?

946
01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:56.099
Mr. Lee. I'm not here to fight.

947
01:00:56.099 --> 01:00:59.209
I called you here so that we can become closer.

948
01:00:59.570 --> 01:01:00.740
I don't drink.

949
01:01:00.910 --> 01:01:01.910
Why not?

950
01:01:02.209 --> 01:01:03.579
Is there a reason you can't drink?

951
01:01:03.579 --> 01:01:05.410
There are hundreds of reasons.

952
01:01:05.410 --> 01:01:07.450
But I have no reason to tell you all of them.

953
01:01:07.450 --> 01:01:09.820
Come on. Tell me.

954
01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:11.720
That's what I wanted to hear.

955
01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:13.360
Eat some of this.

956
01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:14.660
It's good.

957
01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:16.459
The pork is to die for.

958
01:01:18.689 --> 01:01:20.499
I heard it would be a planning meeting.

959
01:01:20.499 --> 01:01:22.729
If you're going to keep saying nonsense,

960
01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:24.800
- I can go... - No, you can't.

961
01:01:28.399 --> 01:01:30.669
Mr. Lee. Don't be like that.

962
01:01:30.669 --> 01:01:32.410
Let's get along...

963
01:01:32.410 --> 01:01:33.610
and discuss the program...

964
01:01:33.610 --> 01:01:34.610
Hey, Newbie.

965
01:01:34.939 --> 01:01:37.349
We're getting along and getting closer.

966
01:01:37.349 --> 01:01:38.349
Right?

967
01:01:39.649 --> 01:01:40.649
Look.

968
01:01:41.079 --> 01:01:43.689
I want to get really close to my DJ.

969
01:01:43.919 --> 01:01:46.559
But if you don't trust me...

970
01:01:46.559 --> 01:01:48.160
Because you aren't trustworthy.

971
01:01:50.289 --> 01:01:52.129
I'm concerned that you'll cause trouble...

972
01:01:52.129 --> 01:01:54.729
while I'm in the booth and leave again.

973
01:02:00.169 --> 01:02:02.570
Have you completed researching me?

974
01:02:04.809 --> 01:02:07.579
Did you research the newbie too?

975
01:02:17.050 --> 01:02:18.090
And if I did?

976
01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:28.459
Isn't that great?

977
01:02:28.530 --> 01:02:30.099
If you searched us,

978
01:02:30.099 --> 01:02:31.099
thought about it,

979
01:02:31.099 --> 01:02:33.070
and chose us,

980
01:02:33.070 --> 01:02:35.140
it's a big honor for us.

981
01:02:35.140 --> 01:02:37.910
That's how much you believe in us.

982
01:02:38.510 --> 01:02:40.240
Serious.

983
01:02:40.539 --> 01:02:42.740
What's wrong with this moron now?

984
01:02:44.910 --> 01:02:46.919
I did think about it before deciding,

985
01:02:46.919 --> 01:02:49.120
but you weren't a part of that consideration.

986
01:02:53.289 --> 01:02:55.120
Seriously.

987
01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:58.090
What's wrong with this top star punk?

988
01:02:59.059 --> 01:03:01.700
But now, I am very concerned.

989
01:03:06.229 --> 01:03:07.899
Should I quit then?

990
01:03:33.175 --> 01:03:34.775
(Radio Romance)

991
01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:36.899
As per the scary contract,

992
01:03:36.899 --> 01:03:38.970
Newbie and I will go home together...

993
01:03:38.970 --> 01:03:39.970
Together?

994
01:03:39.970 --> 01:03:41.939
Ji Soo Ho is taking an overnight trip?

995
01:03:41.939 --> 01:03:44.539
Geu Rim is always behind these grand decisions.

996
01:03:44.539 --> 01:03:47.479
I think I left my laptop bag on the boat.

997
01:03:47.479 --> 01:03:48.709
Do we have to wait long?

998
01:03:48.709 --> 01:03:50.249
The train stopped running.

999
01:03:50.249 --> 01:03:52.450
We'll have to stay the night.

1000
01:03:52.450 --> 01:03:54.280
Is Soo Ho with Ms. Song?

1001
01:03:54.479 --> 01:03:56.249
I've always dreamed...

1002
01:03:56.249 --> 01:03:59.349
of the beautiful first day when my DJ...

1003
01:03:59.349 --> 01:04:01.320
reads from my script.
