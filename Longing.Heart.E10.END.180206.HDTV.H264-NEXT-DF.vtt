[Longing Heart]</i>

<i>[September 30, 2017]</i>

4
00:00:30.704 --> 00:00:31.999
<i>Mr. Kang.</i>

5
00:00:32.648 --> 00:00:33.975
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

6
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.761
<i>And so, I'm going to change the future.</i>

<i>["In Search of Lost Time"
by Marcel Proust]</i>

8
00:00:42.051 --> 00:00:46.225
<i>The things that happened to you
are still in the future for me.</i>

9
00:00:46.225 --> 00:00:47.832
<i>I won't...</i>

10
00:00:47.832 --> 00:00:51.977
<i>meet with Ji Soo
10 years from now, in Seoul.</i>

11
00:00:54.008 --> 00:00:55.548
<i>I will...</i>

12
00:00:56.006 --> 00:00:58.218
<i>only stop Ji Soo from
getting into that accident...</i>

13
00:00:58.218 --> 00:01:00.872
<i>and won't appear before her.</i>

14
00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:04.062
<i>[Shin Woo, there's something
I need to tell you.]</i>

15
00:01:04.062 --> 00:01:06.083
<i>[I'll wait for you tomorrow at
11 o' clock at Firefly Bridge.]</i>

16
00:01:06.083 --> 00:01:08.262
<i>And ten years later, on the day
of Mom's death anniversary</i>

17
00:01:08.262 --> 00:01:11.071
<i>I won't go to Firefly Bridge, either.</i>

18
00:01:25.374 --> 00:01:26.836
<i>If I do that,
the things that happened</i>

19
00:01:26.836 --> 00:01:30.709
<i>because you came back to 2007
won't ever have happened</i>

20
00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:35.020
<i>and everything that happened between
you and Ji Soo will never have happened.</i>

21
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.725
<i>But I...</i>

22
00:01:37.193 --> 00:01:39.892
<i>hope that we part ways with Ji Soo
when we're 18 years old...</i>

23
00:01:39.892 --> 00:01:42.479
<i>and never meet her again.</i>

24
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.199
<i>Meeting each other will only
cause both of us pain</i>

25
00:01:46.199 --> 00:01:49.500
<i>so there's no reason
to repeat all that.</i>

26
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.319
<i>But, if I do this...</i>

27
00:01:52.943 --> 00:01:56.931
<i>Ji Soo may not remember you
in the future.</i>

28
00:01:56.931 --> 00:02:00.100
<i>Because the fact that
she met you as a teacher</i>

29
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.037
<i>will never have happened.</i>

30
00:02:04.214 --> 00:02:06.977
Kang Shin Woo, you idiot!

31
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.499
Oh!

32
00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:39.674
Isn't this the photo that
Geun Deok took of us last time?

33
00:03:39.674 --> 00:03:41.263
- Yeah.
- Huh?

34
00:03:41.263 --> 00:03:44.727
Geun Deok hasn't gotten
this photo printed yet, though.

35
00:03:44.727 --> 00:03:47.692
No, he already did
and gave me one first.

36
00:03:47.692 --> 00:03:49.507
A long time ago.

37
00:03:49.507 --> 00:03:52.268
Can't you give this to me, Mr. Kang?

38
00:03:52.268 --> 00:03:54.818
And you can ask Geun Deok
to print you another copy.

39
00:03:54.818 --> 00:03:56.202
Sure.

40
00:03:57.661 --> 00:04:00.679
Why does this photo look so old, though?

41
00:04:03.336 --> 00:04:06.620
<i>[The photo that Mr. Kang gave me]</i>

42
00:04:07.716 --> 00:04:09.977
<i>If I were your older brother</i>

43
00:04:09.977 --> 00:04:12.337
<i>I would've wanted to tell you that...</i>

44
00:04:12.337 --> 00:04:14.395
<i>it wasn't your fault.</i>

45
00:04:14.395 --> 00:04:17.215
And that nobody in this world
should ever feel guilty...

46
00:04:17.215 --> 00:04:19.171
for having survived.

47
00:04:19.852 --> 00:04:21.782
For someone...

48
00:04:22.313 --> 00:04:25.008
the mere fact that
you're in front of them right now...

49
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.830
will be more than
good enough for them.

50
00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:30.835
It's okay.

51
00:04:31.775 --> 00:04:33.294
It's okay.

52
00:04:34.698 --> 00:04:36.674
This one memory...

53
00:04:37.446 --> 00:04:39.794
is the one that can't disappear.

54
00:04:40.537 --> 00:04:42.258
<i>Tell me...</i>

55
00:04:43.056 --> 00:04:44.955
<i>just one more time.</i>

56
00:04:46.167 --> 00:04:47.943
Just like you did back then.

57
00:04:48.787 --> 00:04:51.100
That it's okay.

58
00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.873
And that you're relieved...

59
00:04:53.873 --> 00:04:55.551
that I'm here now.

60
00:04:56.311 --> 00:04:59.003
And my being here right now
is more than good enough.

61
00:05:00.157 --> 00:05:01.941
Please tell me that...

62
00:05:02.643 --> 00:05:04.294
just one more time.

63
00:05:05.232 --> 00:05:08.612
So for her, she's probably
been waiting for the past ten years.

64
00:06:16.143 --> 00:06:18.475
It's okay if you forget everything.

65
00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:22.345
When we met again last time...

66
00:06:23.121 --> 00:06:28.400
you said that you don't remember
what happened in the past, right?

67
00:06:30.249 --> 00:06:32.436
You should truly live your life
like that now.

68
00:06:32.436 --> 00:06:34.691
Don't overexert yourself
and force yourself to not forget...

69
00:06:35.318 --> 00:06:37.652
and make yourself miserable by doing so.

70
00:06:41.612 --> 00:06:43.289
Even if...

71
00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:47.184
you end up forgetting everything...

72
00:06:48.366 --> 00:06:50.989
please remember this one thing.

73
00:06:51.965 --> 00:06:53.462
That...

74
00:06:54.004 --> 00:06:56.869
there is nobody who should
feel guilty for having survived.

75
00:06:58.595 --> 00:07:00.758
If I were to turn back time...

76
00:07:01.294 --> 00:07:03.676
and be in this very spot again...

77
00:07:05.001 --> 00:07:07.609
and I knew that
things would end like this...

78
00:07:09.304 --> 00:07:12.219
I would still have gone back to meet you
when you were eighteen years old.

79
00:07:13.609 --> 00:07:15.847
To tell you that...

80
00:07:19.323 --> 00:07:21.645
you didn't do anything wrong, Ji Soo.

81
00:07:24.044 --> 00:07:25.790
It wasn't your fault.

82
00:07:28.626 --> 00:07:30.640
I'm sorry, Shin Woo.

83
00:07:45.652 --> 00:07:48.445
What I couldn't tell you back then...

84
00:07:48.445 --> 00:07:50.765
<i>What's her name?</i>

85
00:07:50.765 --> 00:07:53.518
The name of your first love, I mean.

86
00:07:54.289 --> 00:07:56.138
<i>The name of my first love...</i>

87
00:07:57.323 --> 00:07:59.266
was Han Ji Soo.

88
00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:03.284
<i>Even if I give you a problem
that I know the answer to</i>

89
00:08:03.284 --> 00:08:06.948
<i>I can still hope that you'd
choose the wrong answer.</i>

90
00:08:09.042 --> 00:08:10.821
You were always...

91
00:08:12.436 --> 00:08:14.345
my answer.

92
00:08:17.249 --> 00:08:18.614
Thanks...

93
00:08:19.391 --> 00:08:21.046
for so many things...

94
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:26.221
and for liking me
so many times.

95
00:10:17.319 --> 00:10:19.249
What's wrong, Big Sis?

96
00:10:20.817 --> 00:10:23.532
I got this back not too long ago...

97
00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:26.431
and they told me that
this was Mom's.

98
00:10:28.882 --> 00:10:31.739
I have to reorganize
all of her things...

99
00:10:32.354 --> 00:10:34.667
but I can't do it!

100
00:10:35.947 --> 00:10:37.947
Mom!

101
00:10:39.656 --> 00:10:42.009
Mom!

102
00:10:44.071 --> 00:10:45.971
Mom!

103
00:10:49.416 --> 00:10:51.236
I'll do it.

104
00:10:54.821 --> 00:10:56.747
I'll do it.

105
00:11:19.257 --> 00:11:22.229
Who got your bag
all dirty like this?

106
00:11:45.512 --> 00:11:47.694
This is my citizen ID.

107
00:11:49.685 --> 00:11:51.752
Why... did she have two of them?

108
00:12:04.233 --> 00:12:06.811
If this ticket is the one that
Ji Soo gave her...

109
00:12:10.105 --> 00:12:12.889
then, what's this?

110
00:12:38.245 --> 00:12:41.460
This is mine.

111
00:12:45.499 --> 00:12:47.048
But you know...

112
00:12:47.048 --> 00:12:49.144
on the day of Mom's accident...

113
00:12:49.604 --> 00:12:51.839
you didn't get a call
from Mom?

114
00:12:51.839 --> 00:12:53.272
A call?

115
00:12:53.272 --> 00:12:55.795
Mom didn't take her phone
with her that day, though.

116
00:12:55.795 --> 00:12:58.099
When I went to go
pick this up before

117
00:12:58.099 --> 00:13:02.534
I watched the CCTV footage because
I wanted to see her one last time.

118
00:13:03.245 --> 00:13:05.377
And Mom was on the phone.

119
00:13:05.377 --> 00:13:06.483
Really?

120
00:13:07.435 --> 00:13:09.547
I didn't get a call.

121
00:13:09.547 --> 00:13:11.845
Who was it, then?

122
00:13:21.591 --> 00:13:24.038
Huh?
What is this?

123
00:13:24.038 --> 00:13:26.547
When did I get this?

124
00:13:26.547 --> 00:13:28.893
Do they send spam through
voice mails now, too?

125
00:13:52.575 --> 00:13:54.143
<i>Shin Woo.</i>

126
00:13:55.343 --> 00:13:57.181
<i>It's Mom.</i>

127
00:13:57.181 --> 00:13:58.374
Mom.

128
00:14:00.632 --> 00:14:02.548
<i>And... Mr. Kang.</i>

129
00:14:04.622 --> 00:14:07.196
<i>Wait, no.
Not Mr. Kang.</i>

130
00:14:08.213 --> 00:14:10.292
<i>You're my Shin Woo,
aren't you?</i>

131
00:14:11.425 --> 00:14:15.836
You were quite sad because
I didn't recognize you, weren't you?

132
00:14:16.372 --> 00:14:18.013
<i>I have no idea...</i>

133
00:14:18.013 --> 00:14:21.412
how you came all the way
back here, after becoming an adult.

134
00:14:23.654 --> 00:14:26.207
I'm dumb, so no matter
how much I think about it

135
00:14:26.207 --> 00:14:27.970
I can't think of how
this could have happened.

136
00:14:28.899 --> 00:14:30.379
But...

137
00:14:32.782 --> 00:14:34.861
thinking about it now...

138
00:14:35.652 --> 00:14:38.183
this must have been...

139
00:14:38.705 --> 00:14:41.283
a gift to me, from the heavens.

140
00:14:42.694 --> 00:14:45.521
<i>A gift showing me that...</i>

141
00:14:46.133 --> 00:14:47.542
<i>my children grew up to
become fine adults</i>

142
00:14:47.542 --> 00:14:48.951
<i>even after I leave like this.</i>

143
00:14:51.028 --> 00:14:54.697
<i>In my eyes, Shin Woo,
you're still my baby.</i>

144
00:14:54.697 --> 00:15:00.388
<i>But this was a gift that is
making my heart rest at ease</i>

145
00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:02.697
<i>and allowing me go on in peace</i>

146
00:15:02.697 --> 00:15:05.816
<i>since you've grown up
to be such a fine adult.</i>

147
00:15:05.816 --> 00:15:07.498
So...

148
00:15:08.013 --> 00:15:09.763
right now...

149
00:15:09.763 --> 00:15:12.325
I'm not scared at all.

150
00:15:12.325 --> 00:15:14.808
And I'm not worried
in the slightest.

151
00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:19.569
Who could ever ask for
anything more?

152
00:15:20.114 --> 00:15:21.513
Right?

153
00:15:22.047 --> 00:15:23.503
<i>Also, Shin Woo.</i>

154
00:15:24.783 --> 00:15:27.456
<i>You remember the problem that
you and I discussed at my shop</i>

155
00:15:27.456 --> 00:15:31.005
<i>while we drank soju together?</i>

156
00:15:32.152 --> 00:15:34.961
<i>I think I found the answer already.</i>

157
00:15:35.845 --> 00:15:38.601
<i>You know, about why
the girl you like...</i>

158
00:15:39.215 --> 00:15:42.671
<i>was so cruel to you after seeing
you for the first time in ten years.</i>

159
00:15:42.671 --> 00:15:44.700
I think I must have

160
00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:47.969
wanted to send her
to you last time, too.

161
00:15:47.969 --> 00:15:50.254
Just like now.

162
00:15:50.254 --> 00:15:52.763
One ticket for the
2 o' clock ferry, please.

163
00:15:55.604 --> 00:15:57.504
There's no doubt about it.

164
00:15:57.504 --> 00:15:59.824
Mr. Kang is definitely my Shin Woo.

165
00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:05.242
He's my Shin Woo,
from 10 years in the future.

166
00:16:08.279 --> 00:16:10.176
Oh.

167
00:16:10.176 --> 00:16:13.113
And he didn't even get to call me "mom."

168
00:16:13.113 --> 00:16:18.345
He was in front of me this whole time,
and yet I didn't even realize that!

169
00:16:21.657 --> 00:16:23.257
She's...

170
00:16:23.257 --> 00:16:26.360
definitely the girl that
my Shin Woo likes.

171
00:16:26.921 --> 00:16:30.651
She's supposed to be meeting with my
Shin Woo now, so what's she doing here?

172
00:16:30.651 --> 00:16:33.643
Excuse me, Student!

173
00:16:33.643 --> 00:16:37.677
You're my Shin Woo's
classmate, right?

174
00:16:37.677 --> 00:16:42.038
By the way, did my Shin Woo
contact you last night, by any chance?

175
00:16:42.038 --> 00:16:43.691
Shin Woo?

176
00:16:45.658 --> 00:16:49.244
Oh, um... my phone is broken, so...

177
00:16:49.244 --> 00:16:50.356
Oh.

178
00:16:50.356 --> 00:16:53.532
By the way, where are
you headed, Ma'am?

179
00:16:53.532 --> 00:16:55.249
Oh, me?

180
00:16:55.249 --> 00:16:58.128
I, um...

181
00:16:58.128 --> 00:17:01.505
I'm on my way to visit someone
since they said that they were sick.

182
00:17:01.505 --> 00:17:03.811
But they said that all the
tickets for the ferry are sold out.

183
00:17:03.811 --> 00:17:05.555
Oh, and I really have to go, too!

184
00:17:05.555 --> 00:17:07.580
How terrible.
What should I do?

185
00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:10.230
Would you like to take my ticket, then?

186
00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:12.208
Really?
Can I take it?

187
00:17:12.208 --> 00:17:14.574
I have no intention of leaving
to study abroad, anyway.

188
00:17:14.574 --> 00:17:16.072
I don't need to go.

189
00:17:16.072 --> 00:17:17.515
Here.

190
00:17:18.209 --> 00:17:19.756
All right, thanks!

191
00:17:19.756 --> 00:17:21.015
Then...

192
00:17:21.639 --> 00:17:22.717
Um...

193
00:17:22.717 --> 00:17:25.589
um, here.

194
00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:27.763
I'll give you this
in exchange.

195
00:17:28.771 --> 00:17:31.751
Oh, it's so pretty on you
and fits perfectly!

196
00:17:31.751 --> 00:17:34.304
This is too generous of a gift for me
to accept in exchange for a ticket.

197
00:17:34.304 --> 00:17:37.340
Then, can you do me a favor?

198
00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:41.694
Can you get your cellphone fixed
as soon as you leave this place?

199
00:17:41.694 --> 00:17:43.428
My... phone?

200
00:17:43.428 --> 00:17:44.755
Yeah.

201
00:17:44.755 --> 00:17:48.650
Oh, it's time for my ferry
so I'll be leaving now.

202
00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:51.386
All right.
Goodbye.

203
00:17:52.111 --> 00:17:54.167
<i>So, if you meet her again...</i>

204
00:17:54.167 --> 00:17:56.163
<i>be sure to tell her that
it wasn't bad luck that you two met again</i>

205
00:17:56.163 --> 00:17:58.245
<i>but rather, that it was fate.</i>

206
00:17:58.245 --> 00:17:59.841
Tell her that your mom...

207
00:18:00.324 --> 00:18:02.377
held your hand tight...

208
00:18:02.377 --> 00:18:05.330
and created this opportunity
for you two to be together.

209
00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:07.259
<i>My Shin Hee...</i>

210
00:18:07.859 --> 00:18:09.279
<i>and my Shin Woo.</i>

211
00:18:09.279 --> 00:18:11.475
<i>The thing about happiness is that
you need to hold onto it tightly</i>

212
00:18:11.475 --> 00:18:14.538
<i>with your own hands for you
to keep it by your side.</i>

213
00:18:14.538 --> 00:18:16.899
<i>So don't let it slip through
your fingers...</i>

214
00:18:17.548 --> 00:18:21.376
<i>so you have to hold onto it tightly
and live happily, okay?</i>

215
00:18:21.376 --> 00:18:23.554
As much as...

216
00:18:23.554 --> 00:18:25.843
my love for you two.

217
00:18:50.274 --> 00:18:52.818
I have to tell this to Ji Soo.

218
00:18:56.717 --> 00:18:59.686
But I don't even know
where Ji Soo is now.

219
00:19:04.193 --> 00:19:06.183
Yeah, So Ra.

220
00:19:06.183 --> 00:19:08.780
What time did you say Ji Soo's
flight was today, again?

221
00:19:18.767 --> 00:19:21.545
<i>I told you that I'd
tell you my name, right?</i>

222
00:19:21.545 --> 00:19:25.155
<i>My name is Kang Shin Woo.</i>

223
00:19:25.155 --> 00:19:26.809
My first love's name...

224
00:19:26.809 --> 00:19:28.765
was Han Ji Soo.

225
00:19:28.765 --> 00:19:30.968
What's her name?

226
00:19:30.968 --> 00:19:32.650
Your first love's name, I mean.

227
00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:35.936
That's something that I really
can't tell you right now.

228
00:19:35.936 --> 00:19:37.372
Why not?

229
00:19:37.372 --> 00:19:38.716
Later.

230
00:19:38.716 --> 00:19:40.734
I'll tell you later.

231
00:19:40.734 --> 00:19:42.511
You were always...

232
00:19:43.709 --> 00:19:45.681
my answer.

233
00:19:50.414 --> 00:19:51.917
What's the matter?

234
00:19:54.462 --> 00:19:56.143
Senior.

235
00:19:56.143 --> 00:19:57.855
If, by any chance,
you thought that...

236
00:19:57.855 --> 00:20:01.902
a person that you met in the past
and a person you met in the present

237
00:20:01.902 --> 00:20:05.044
were two different people...

238
00:20:05.044 --> 00:20:09.001
but it turned out that
they were the same person...

239
00:20:09.738 --> 00:20:12.431
how could something
like that be possible?

240
00:20:12.431 --> 00:20:13.779
Time travel?

241
00:20:13.779 --> 00:20:16.015
But that makes no sense.

242
00:20:16.015 --> 00:20:19.219
I guess they must have been determined
enough to make the impossible possible.

243
00:20:19.921 --> 00:20:21.949
I'm just kidding.

244
00:20:21.949 --> 00:20:24.824
Why, did you see a plot like that
in a book, or something?

245
00:20:25.642 --> 00:20:27.009
Senior.

246
00:20:27.009 --> 00:20:31.279
I think I'll have to meet with
someone before I go.

247
00:20:33.248 --> 00:20:35.306
Stop it, Ji Soo.

248
00:20:35.715 --> 00:20:36.970
I...

249
00:20:37.564 --> 00:20:39.905
always thought
that it was strange that

250
00:20:39.905 --> 00:20:43.850
you hate talking about
your high school days...

251
00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:46.407
and yet you treasure
that photo so much.

252
00:20:46.407 --> 00:20:48.780
That's all because
of that friend of yours, right?

253
00:20:49.427 --> 00:20:50.997
Kang Shin Woo.

254
00:20:55.902 --> 00:20:58.796
To tell you the truth, on the day
I asked you to go to the U.S. with me

255
00:20:58.796 --> 00:21:00.653
I met with him.

256
00:21:00.653 --> 00:21:03.043
<i>What... is your reason?</i>

257
00:21:03.043 --> 00:21:05.174
Because Ji Soo will grow
more and more uncomfortable

258
00:21:05.174 --> 00:21:07.371
the more she sees me.

259
00:21:07.371 --> 00:21:10.770
<i>And I heard about the accident
that happened 10 years ago.</i>

260
00:21:11.355 --> 00:21:13.126
And then, I knew

261
00:21:13.126 --> 00:21:15.981
who you were looking at
in that photo.

262
00:21:15.981 --> 00:21:17.636
Ji Soo.

263
00:21:18.179 --> 00:21:21.439
Seeing each other will only cause
you two more grief.

264
00:21:21.439 --> 00:21:25.136
Are you sure that you won't be able to
think about his mom when you see him?

265
00:21:25.136 --> 00:21:26.601
And what about him?

266
00:21:26.601 --> 00:21:29.221
Do you think he'll be able to avoid
thinking about it while looking at you?

267
00:21:34.874 --> 00:21:36.651
That's why...

268
00:21:37.439 --> 00:21:39.207
you should stay by
my side, like you are now.

269
00:21:39.207 --> 00:21:41.163
I'm not in the mood
to joke around, Senior.

270
00:21:41.163 --> 00:21:43.130
I've never joked around about this.

271
00:21:43.816 --> 00:21:46.538
After confessing to you
ten years ago...

272
00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:49.941
I've always been serious
about my feelings for you.

273
00:21:49.941 --> 00:21:51.774
Senior.

274
00:21:52.359 --> 00:21:54.094
You really didn't know?

275
00:21:54.763 --> 00:21:57.702
Are you sure you didn't just want to
believe that I was joking around?

276
00:22:02.773 --> 00:22:04.795
Let's just say that
I was only joking around, then.

277
00:22:04.795 --> 00:22:07.011
Until you tell me to.

278
00:22:07.683 --> 00:22:09.558
I don't know when
that may be

279
00:22:09.558 --> 00:22:11.923
but I'll wait by your side until then.

280
00:22:11.923 --> 00:22:14.180
Allow me that, at least.

281
00:22:18.396 --> 00:22:20.482
It's almost time.
Let's head inside.

282
00:22:25.223 --> 00:22:27.239
It really is about time now...

283
00:22:27.942 --> 00:22:30.278
for you throw out that photo now,
don't you think?

284
00:22:43.799 --> 00:22:46.480
She said that it's a
7 o' clock flight.

285
00:22:47.143 --> 00:22:48.679
Ugh.

286
00:22:57.207 --> 00:22:59.239
Are you okay, Shin Woo?

287
00:22:59.239 --> 00:23:00.253
Yeah.

288
00:23:03.297 --> 00:23:07.353
You don't know where in the U.S.
Ji Soo went, either?

289
00:23:07.353 --> 00:23:08.603
No.

290
00:23:08.603 --> 00:23:11.373
I only heard that she's
going to the U.S.

291
00:23:11.373 --> 00:23:13.915
How am I supposed
to tell her, then?

293

There's a photo that you were in,
so I wanted to give it to you.

Here.

296
00:23:26.068 --> 00:23:27.588
Ugh.

297
00:23:28.911 --> 00:23:30.976
Hey, where are you going, Kang Shin Woo?

298
00:23:30.976 --> 00:23:32.962
I have one of you, too.
Take it.

Well, yeah, if you hold

00:27:00.991 --> 00:27:02.680
Shin Woo.

320
00:27:05.912 --> 00:27:07.922
And... Mr. Kang.

321
00:27:11.063 --> 00:27:12.679
And...

322
00:27:13.322 --> 00:27:15.514
that little kid, too.

323
00:27:16.151 --> 00:27:18.421
all of those people
were you?

324
00:27:21.334 --> 00:27:23.919
All those people I liked...

325
00:27:24.461 --> 00:27:26.607
were all really you?

326
00:27:32.894 --> 00:27:34.222
For me...

327
00:27:34.797 --> 00:27:36.501
it was always you.

328
00:27:37.636 --> 00:27:39.894
Even though I went back in time...

329
00:27:40.527 --> 00:27:42.828
and no matter
what time I lived in...

330
00:27:44.773 --> 00:27:46.767
my answer was always...

331
00:27:47.943 --> 00:27:49.978
only you.

332
00:27:54.226 --> 00:27:57.134
I thought that I'd lost you again.

333
00:27:57.697 --> 00:27:59.282
How could I go...

334
00:27:59.884 --> 00:28:01.634
when now, I finally know...

335
00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:04.671
what she meant by that?

336
00:28:13.466 --> 00:28:15.438
Your mother's...

337
00:28:17.241 --> 00:28:19.241
final request, I mean.

338
00:28:21.027 --> 00:28:24.459
Oh yeah, I have one more
favor to ask of you.

339
00:28:24.459 --> 00:28:26.410
Yes, go ahead.

340
00:28:28.315 --> 00:28:32.653
Please take good care
of my sons.

341
00:28:32.653 --> 00:28:34.244
Your... sons?

342
00:28:34.244 --> 00:28:35.726
Yeah.

343
00:28:36.646 --> 00:28:38.642
My sons.

344
00:28:39.524 --> 00:28:40.966
Um...

345
00:28:40.966 --> 00:28:45.985
if my silly Shin Woo isn't able
to say anything to you...

346
00:28:45.985 --> 00:28:47.854
then...

347
00:28:47.854 --> 00:28:52.064
when you meet him later,
like, much later...

348
00:28:52.064 --> 00:28:54.367
don't say that you hate him.

349
00:28:54.367 --> 00:28:56.280
Instead, be nice to him.

350
00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:58.219
Do it for me.

351
00:28:58.219 --> 00:29:02.524
My Shin Woo will have grown up to
be a kind, upstanding young man.

352
00:29:02.524 --> 00:29:04.682
I can guarantee you that.

353
00:29:07.276 --> 00:29:10.432
This fits you so well, as if
it was meant to be yours, huh?

354
00:29:10.432 --> 00:29:14.566
I really hope that you'll keep this
on your finger for a long, long time.

355
00:29:29.526 --> 00:29:31.642
I'll give this back to you.

356
00:29:34.197 --> 00:29:36.430
I'm sure that my mom...

357
00:29:37.029 --> 00:29:39.411
would definitely want you
to have this.

358
00:29:52.439 --> 00:29:54.113
To tell you the truth...

359
00:29:54.683 --> 00:29:56.638
I missed you.

360
00:29:58.097 --> 00:29:59.930
Quite a lot.

361
00:30:08.389 --> 00:30:11.065
All I can say to you...

362
00:30:11.927 --> 00:30:15.409
is that I'm sorry.

363
00:30:18.081 --> 00:30:20.086
And after that would be...

364
00:30:20.776 --> 00:30:23.080
"I want to see you."

365
00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:25.205
And that I missed you.

366
00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:29.821
And then, I think of other
things that I want to say...

367
00:30:31.155 --> 00:30:33.122
which makes me feel bad.

368
00:30:40.142 --> 00:30:41.323
And then...

369
00:30:41.876 --> 00:30:43.834
on days that I start thinking

370
00:30:44.399 --> 00:30:49.434
that it should've been me
who got on that ferry...

371
00:30:52.427 --> 00:30:55.981
I missed Mr. Kang quite a lot.

372
00:30:59.130 --> 00:31:01.485
And I didn't even know
that he was actually you.

373
00:31:03.653 --> 00:31:07.249
So I guess that,
for the past ten years...

374
00:31:07.942 --> 00:31:11.834
I was only ever thinking about you.

375
00:31:13.671 --> 00:31:15.168
What about you?

376
00:31:15.168 --> 00:31:17.305
My memories...

377
00:31:17.923 --> 00:31:21.394
are all a mess, in terms of chronological
order and space-time.

378
00:31:22.034 --> 00:31:24.702
<i>My memories of the first
2007 that I lived through</i>

379
00:31:24.702 --> 00:31:26.900
<i>where we parted ways
without knowing anything.</i>

380
00:31:27.721 --> 00:31:32.448
<i>And my memories as a 28-year-old
when I went back to 2007.</i>

381
00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:36.536
<i>And my memories of coming
to 2017, as an 18-year-old.</i>

382
00:31:37.171 --> 00:31:39.899
<i>And my memories of
returning to 2007</i>

383
00:31:39.899 --> 00:31:42.766
and having lived my life
up until now.

384
00:31:45.874 --> 00:31:49.653
All of those things are
things that I experienced.

385
00:31:52.138 --> 00:31:55.285
And so, all of those
memories are mine.

386
00:31:56.302 --> 00:32:00.412
Sometimes, I get confused
and get things mixed up.

387
00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:03.928
But, one thing is for sure.

388
00:32:11.441 --> 00:32:14.020
And that's the fact that...

389
00:32:14.584 --> 00:32:16.831
I met you every single time...

390
00:32:17.415 --> 00:32:19.170
and liked you...

391
00:32:20.174 --> 00:32:21.978
and so...

392
00:32:22.593 --> 00:32:24.640
I was always waiting for you.

393
00:32:52.392 --> 00:32:54.420
<i>Fate seemed cruel and powerful</i>

394
00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:56.690
<i>and impossible to change,
no matter what I did</i>

395
00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:59.093
<i>even when I re-lived my life.</i>

396
00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:02.194
<i>But now I know</i>

397
00:33:02.194 --> 00:33:04.370
<i>that the truly powerful thing...</i>

398
00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:06.806
<i>hadn't been fate.</i>

399
00:33:09.276 --> 00:33:11.456
<i>Even when I re-lived my life...</i>

400
00:33:12.061 --> 00:33:14.504
<i>you were the one
that I liked each time.</i>

401
00:33:17.456 --> 00:33:20.603
<i>And you liked me back
each and every time.</i>

402
00:33:22.086 --> 00:33:23.669
<i>And...</i>

403
00:33:32.332 --> 00:33:33.850
<i>my mom.</i>

404
00:33:40.394 --> 00:33:42.982
<i>Our miraculous present</i>

405
00:33:42.982 --> 00:33:45.468
<i>which was made possible through
the love of all of these people.</i>

406
00:33:45.468 --> 00:33:47.728
There isn't anything
that you want?

407
00:33:48.296 --> 00:33:49.497
Yeah.

408
00:33:49.497 --> 00:33:51.880
I only have things
that I want to give to you.

409
00:33:55.071 --> 00:33:56.793
Exactly.

410
00:33:56.793 --> 00:33:59.266
I'm only ever
receiving things from you.

411
00:33:59.975 --> 00:34:03.223
Well, then... a birthday present.

412
00:34:04.614 --> 00:34:06.727
Every day, until I become
100 years old.

413
00:34:10.538 --> 00:34:14.857
Coming here makes me
want to see Deok Goo.

414
00:34:14.857 --> 00:34:16.535
Deok Goo?

415
00:34:17.863 --> 00:34:20.870
It almost feels like I'm hearing you say
your ex-boyfriend's name.

416
00:34:25.096 --> 00:34:28.658
I kind of want to see that punk, too.

417
00:34:37.939 --> 00:34:41.667
<i>In his own time,
that punk is...</i>

418
00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:46.848
<i>He's walking forward cautiously,
step by step</i>

419
00:34:46.848 --> 00:34:50.440
<i>and following in my footsteps.</i>

420
00:35:01.946 --> 00:35:03.477
<i>Mr. Kang.</i>

421
00:35:03.477 --> 00:35:07.346
<i>You're definitely with
Ji Soo right now, right?</i>

422
00:35:07.346 --> 00:35:10.672
<i>Ji Soo is happy, right?</i>

423
00:35:11.672 --> 00:35:13.904
<i>I'll believe that.</i>

424
00:35:13.904 --> 00:35:18.303
<i>And so, I've decided to bet
everything I have on that future.</i>

425
00:35:18.303 --> 00:35:24.232
<i>Because I can't have your and Ji Soo's
present change because of me.</i>

426
00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:35.163
Give that here.

427
00:35:38.201 --> 00:35:39.504
I'm going to this university.

428
00:35:39.504 --> 00:35:41.567
Hankook University.
Math Education major.

429
00:35:41.567 --> 00:35:43.571
You're only a second year
in high school.

430
00:35:43.571 --> 00:35:45.502
And yet, you're thinking about re-taking
your college entrance exams already?

431
00:35:45.502 --> 00:35:47.580
I'm going to get in when I'm
in my third year, okay?

432
00:35:50.223 --> 00:35:51.388
How, exactly?

433
00:35:51.388 --> 00:35:53.094
Are you planning to be reborn?

434
00:35:53.779 --> 00:35:55.301
Gosh, I can't believe you.

435
00:35:56.194 --> 00:35:59.593
But, why do you have
such a detailed life plan?

436
00:35:59.593 --> 00:36:01.558
You want to go to
college in 2009

437
00:36:01.558 --> 00:36:03.230
and go to the army
in 2010.

438
00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:05.745
And you want to get your
teacher certification in 2015?

439
00:36:09.502 --> 00:36:11.794
I have to live like this,
no matter what.

440
00:36:11.794 --> 00:36:13.841
So that nothing changes.

441
00:36:13.841 --> 00:36:15.027
Huh?

442
00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:17.464
Oh yeah.

443
00:36:17.464 --> 00:36:20.797
Do you know which division of the
military my old homeroom teacher joined?

444
00:36:20.797 --> 00:36:22.312
The Marines.

445
00:36:23.029 --> 00:36:26.669
He said that he went somewhere difficult
because of his first love, or whatever.

446
00:36:26.669 --> 00:36:27.933
Ugh.

447
00:36:28.614 --> 00:36:30.906
<i>[Marines]</i>

448
00:36:30.906 --> 00:36:32.078
Ugh, seriously!

449
00:36:32.078 --> 00:36:33.756
I just can't bring myself to like him.

450
00:36:35.350 --> 00:36:36.564
Just study.

451
00:36:43.314 --> 00:36:45.446
<i>I pray every day...</i>

452
00:36:46.078 --> 00:36:48.694
<i>for nothing more,
and nothing less.</i>

453
00:36:48.694 --> 00:36:50.439
<i>Just that...</i>

454
00:36:51.015 --> 00:36:52.812
<i>we'll always be like this.</i>

455
00:36:53.491 --> 00:36:56.165
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

456
00:36:56.165 --> 00:36:59.714
By the side of my friends,
who've suddenly discovered their dreams.

457
00:37:01.681 --> 00:37:03.643
Seriously, congrats,
Min Seok!

458
00:37:03.643 --> 00:37:06.464
Yeah, congrats. I heard your
webtoon is being made into a movie.

459
00:37:06.464 --> 00:37:07.785
Thank you.

460
00:37:07.785 --> 00:37:10.549
I told you that I have a great eye.

461
00:37:10.575 --> 00:37:13.672
Who was the one who threatened
him with divorce, again?

462
00:37:14.218 --> 00:37:15.290
Ow!

463
00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:16.913
All that there's left now is for you to
make tons of money

464
00:37:16.913 --> 00:37:18.701
and have So Ra open her own salon.

465
00:37:18.701 --> 00:37:21.259
Yeah. I'll get her a salon, and we'll
have to have another child, too.

466
00:37:21.259 --> 00:37:23.178
Are you going to keep on
spouting nonsense?

467
00:37:23.178 --> 00:37:24.488
Well, I'm going to be the one
raising them, anyway!

468
00:37:24.488 --> 00:37:27.468
You can talk when you can be the one
to give birth to the kid too, then.

469
00:37:27.468 --> 00:37:29.192
- No!
- Why, you...

470
00:37:30.448 --> 00:37:34.254
But still, it must be nice that you guys
had kids early and raised them already.

471
00:37:35.051 --> 00:37:36.299
Yes, well...

472
00:37:36.299 --> 00:37:37.752
But um, Ms. Baek.

473
00:37:37.752 --> 00:37:40.681
Thank you so much for
congratulating us, but...

474
00:37:40.681 --> 00:37:44.946
why... are you here?

475
00:37:45.625 --> 00:37:46.710
Hey!

476
00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:48.315
Well, the thing is...

477
00:37:49.078 --> 00:37:50.314
Oh!

478
00:37:50.314 --> 00:37:52.763
I heard that you're
dating someone nowadays.

479
00:37:52.763 --> 00:37:55.189
Huh?
Yeah.

480
00:37:55.189 --> 00:37:59.493
Doesn't your boyfriend have any friends
that aren't married yet, then?

481
00:37:59.493 --> 00:38:04.712
Well... I think one of his best friends
hasn't gotten married yet.

482
00:38:04.712 --> 00:38:09.073
That's great! Can you introduce him
to Shin Woo's sister, then?

483
00:38:10.728 --> 00:38:11.895
Hey!

484
00:38:11.895 --> 00:38:14.779
Why are you trying to
defile my family tree?

485
00:38:14.779 --> 00:38:16.020
What do you mean?

486
00:38:16.879 --> 00:38:18.636
- Oh, you're here?
- Oh!

487
00:38:18.636 --> 00:38:20.047
Why are you here alone?

488
00:38:20.047 --> 00:38:21.457
I thought you were
bringing your girlfriend.

489
00:38:21.457 --> 00:38:23.915
My girlfriend is right here, though.

490
00:38:23.915 --> 00:38:24.942
- Huh?
- Huh?

491
00:38:24.942 --> 00:38:27.096
- Who?
- Who else?

492
00:38:27.096 --> 00:38:29.040
The prettiest woman here.

493
00:38:29.951 --> 00:38:31.846
Oh, jeez.

494
00:38:32.830 --> 00:38:35.424
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Here.

495
00:38:41.433 --> 00:38:44.165
Shin Woo, Shin Woo, Shin Woo!
The first place where you confessed!

496
00:38:44.165 --> 00:38:45.203
- One, two, three!
- One, two, three!

497
00:38:45.203 --> 00:38:46.482
- The hospital!
- Firefly Bridge!

498
00:38:46.482 --> 00:38:47.966
- Come on!
- What was that?

499
00:38:47.966 --> 00:38:50.165
You know, back when you
were Deok Goo.

500
00:38:50.165 --> 00:38:51.189
- One more time!
- Okay.

501
00:38:51.189 --> 00:38:52.234
A different question, then.

502
00:38:52.234 --> 00:38:54.285
The first time that you two
had physical contact!

503
00:38:54.285 --> 00:38:55.339
One, two, three!

504
00:38:55.339 --> 00:38:56.614
- The schoolyard!
- Firefly Bridge!

505
00:38:56.614 --> 00:38:58.138
What's with you two?

506
00:38:58.138 --> 00:38:59.777
Are you sure you two are dating?

507
00:38:59.777 --> 00:39:01.194
Oh, of course!

508
00:39:01.194 --> 00:39:04.690
I wonder what you did,
and with whom, at Firefly Bridge.

509
00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:05.774
It's weird.

510
00:39:05.774 --> 00:39:08.120
- It's really weird!
- Back then...

511
00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:09.477
with Deok Goo.

512
00:39:09.477 --> 00:39:10.531
Jeez.

513
00:39:10.531 --> 00:39:12.908
Here, have this, Ms. Baek.

514
00:39:13.785 --> 00:39:15.768
Come on, why are you
acting like this?

515
00:39:16.419 --> 00:39:18.207
Stop it!
That's enough.

516
00:39:18.207 --> 00:39:20.033
Let go of me.

517
00:39:27.763 --> 00:39:29.203
Oh!

518
00:39:33.459 --> 00:39:35.435
Stop it, it's hot!

519
00:39:35.435 --> 00:39:37.138
Hey, Kang Shin Woo!

520
00:39:37.138 --> 00:39:38.540
Are you still mad?

521
00:39:40.719 --> 00:39:42.598
Tell me the truth.

522
00:39:42.598 --> 00:39:43.636
About what?

523
00:39:43.636 --> 00:39:45.788
I feel like you liked him more.

524
00:39:45.788 --> 00:39:47.089
You did, didn't you?

525
00:39:48.518 --> 00:39:49.707
Well...

526
00:39:49.707 --> 00:39:53.401
I do think that he was
more my type, yeah.

527
00:39:53.401 --> 00:39:54.712
What?

528
00:39:54.712 --> 00:39:56.629
I'm just kidding!

529
00:39:56.629 --> 00:39:58.125
Why is that even important?

530
00:39:58.125 --> 00:39:59.681
That was all you too, anyway.

531
00:40:03.642 --> 00:40:06.053
- Hurry up and tell him! Do it!
- Hurry!

532
00:40:06.053 --> 00:40:07.542
Teach.

533
00:40:08.049 --> 00:40:09.518
I like you.

534
00:40:10.098 --> 00:40:11.216
Huh?

535
00:40:12.779 --> 00:40:15.265
Teach, she wants you to wait
just one more year for her.

536
00:40:15.265 --> 00:40:17.093
She's serious about it, Teach!

537
00:40:19.116 --> 00:40:20.421
Wow.

538
00:40:20.421 --> 00:40:23.636
How is it that this is the same,
even after ten years?

539
00:40:23.636 --> 00:40:25.431
She's just like you.

540
00:40:26.192 --> 00:40:27.723
This won't do.

541
00:40:27.723 --> 00:40:28.796
Let's go.

542
00:40:29.352 --> 00:40:30.433
Go where?

543
00:40:30.433 --> 00:40:32.431
Hurry up and transfer over to
a boys' high school!

544
00:40:32.431 --> 00:40:34.067
I don't think this place
is a good fit for you.

545
00:40:34.881 --> 00:40:38.515
<i>There are days when we fight
over insignificant things like this.</i>

546
00:40:38.515 --> 00:40:41.631
<i>But each and every moment
that we share together</i>

547
00:40:41.631 --> 00:40:43.781
<i>sparkle and shine
in a blindingly bright way.</i>

548
00:40:44.437 --> 00:40:46.270
What are you thinking about?

549
00:40:48.122 --> 00:40:50.475
I'm wondering about
what you're thinking about.

550
00:40:51.835 --> 00:40:53.663
If, by any chance

551
00:40:53.663 --> 00:40:56.779
the past changes because of
something that Deok Goo does

552
00:40:56.779 --> 00:40:58.962
and our memories change, too...

553
00:40:58.962 --> 00:41:01.312
and so, if we wake up one day

554
00:41:01.312 --> 00:41:03.940
and something has happened to us,
what do we do then?

555
00:41:04.379 --> 00:41:07.676
Like, what if the things you did while
you traveled through time disappear

556
00:41:07.676 --> 00:41:10.038
or our memories disappear?

557
00:41:10.821 --> 00:41:15.319
Or, we're not together
like we are now?

558
00:41:17.801 --> 00:41:19.801
It doesn't matter.

559
00:41:20.328 --> 00:41:22.658
No matter what happens...

560
00:41:22.658 --> 00:41:26.029
I'd meet you as many times as I'd need to

561
00:41:26.029 --> 00:41:28.640
and like you as many times
as I'd need to...

562
00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:30.859
and hold onto you...

563
00:41:31.495 --> 00:41:33.422

My friend attends this school.

567

Really? Then go see them
before we go.

568
00:42:08.877 --> 00:42:10.518
Not yet.

569
00:42:10.518 --> 00:42:12.536
I can't meet with her yet.

570
