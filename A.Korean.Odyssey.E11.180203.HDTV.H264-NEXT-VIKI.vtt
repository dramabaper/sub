We're walking ordinarily.

Because a decision has been made about which one of the three ordinary relationships we are in.

Since you kissed me first, we are definitely not friends.

Oh my gosh! What to do?

61
00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:49.710
Lucifer Entertainment has even made an official announcement hoping for a speedy recovery.

62

Gosh, seriously. I was getting closer with him too!

64
00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:04.350
Chairman Woo Hwi's current state is very grim.

65
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.240
Then could he die?

66
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.670
Although I'd like to believe the worst situation wouldn't happen...

67
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:17.030
You stated he's in a grim state, could you elaborate on that?

What is going on with him?

69
00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.610
Please tell us clearly.

70
00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.220

71
00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.190
How are you planning to take care of the show?

72
00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.770
Is he really dying?

73
00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.870
Sam Jang, why are you also like this?

74
00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.100
Naturally, Ma Wang is perfectly fine.

75
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.080
Then why is he staying in the hospital?

76
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.950
Having him in a hospital room is Ma Wang's illusion.

77
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:12.760
Using this opportunity, Ma Wang has decided to die.

78
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.610
Unexpectedly, a tragic accident has happened.

79
00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:26.350
After deep thought, I, Chairman of Lucifer Entertainment, Woo Hwi,

80
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:32.430
have decided to die using this opportunity.

81
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:42.210
What situation is this?

82
00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:48.500
We change lives at a reasonable time, but since he's been stabbed, he's saying he'll die.

83
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.300
Why do you go around getting stabbed? Geez.

84
00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.920
Ma Wang, because of the side effects of that drug last time, aren't you totally losing your energy?

85
00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:01.320
I got deliberately stabbed... for the sake of humankind.

86
00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:05.900

<i>You said you'd be relaying the torch. I'm really proud of you.</i>

93

94
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:30.200
<i>I'm more nervous than observing athlete Sohn Kee Chung running the marathon long ago. (T.N.: Sohn won gold in 1936)</i>

<i>Take pictures well.</i>

96
00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:34.830
<i>Yes. The photographer is taking photos over there especially for you.</i>

97
00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:39.740
<i>Instead of over there, tell him to take photos over here in the front so the pictures come out well.</i>

98
00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:41.870
<i>Ah, yes.</i>

99
00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:47.580
<i>Ah, yes. yes. Thank you. Thank you.</i>

100
00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:58.600
<i>Ah, yes. Thank you. Yes. Fighting. Thank you.</i>

101
00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:10.800
<i>Wait, what is that?</i>

102
00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:21.720
<i>Among so many humans, I can't let a human possessed by an evil spirit wield a knife.</i>

103
00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:26.870
<i>That's why I had no choice but to sacrifice my abdomen for him.</i>

104
00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:29.750
<i>That human..</i>

105
00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:48.490
<i>Get lost!</i>

106
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:06.460
For the time being, it'll be difficult to go around as Woo Hwi.

107
00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:09.110
I was sick and tired of the program too.

108
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:11.840
It's good to die at this time.

109
00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.940
That's right. You made a good decision. What's the use of living longer?

110
00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:17.510
What are you going to do after you die?

111
00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:24.370
Looking back, Woo Hwi's life was too noisy.

112
00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:31.260
After quietly going on a trip, I'm thinking of opening a hotel in a secluded place next time.

113
00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:35.380
Oh! That's good! Let's open one in a warm country.

114
00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:38.610
Let's open? Hey, why are you scaring me like that?

115
00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:43.250
I'm going to open one in a very <i>cold</i> country.

116
00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:47.120
Secretary Ma, are you going to follow Ma Wang and die?

117
00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.920
Of course. I have to die as soon as possible.

118
00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:53.920
After Ma Wang dies, should I also retire and die?

119
00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:57.140
If you die, do you want to come with me and live at the dragon sea palace?

120
00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:02.820
Over there, there's a vacation house. It's nice.

121
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:11.590
- Sa Oh Jeong, until when are you going to live?
- I plan to die after I retire.

122
00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:17.460
But everyone, you've all lived a socially recognized life.

123
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:20.810
If you just die, won't humans be thrown into confusion?

124
00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:24.380
Earlier, we could just disappear but these days

125
00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:27.440
because we leave many photos and documents behind,

126
00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:30.320
it's a bit of a headache.

127
00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:34.780
So why did you get famous without a plan and create an unnecessary dilemma? You should've just lazed around like me.

128
00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:39.480
That's right. Here, it's only you.

129
00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:44.560
You're the only one living as an unemployed, nut job of a thug.

130
00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:48.950
What's wrong with living as an unemployed thug and nut job? It's so convenient to live as a nut job.

131
00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:51.040
If you become famous, you just complicate things for yourself!

132
00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:54.520
If I'm going to live, I might as well receive respect from humans.

133
00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:57.930
Don't you need to receive love to make it worth living?

134
00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:02.060
I don't need such things. Respect and love.

135
00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.950
I just need to receive them from Sam Jang.

136
00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:15.310
Sam Jang, by chance?

137
00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:19.400
No! It's definitely not!

138
00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:23.180
What do you mean by no? If you keep acting this way, I'm not going to activate.

139
00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:26.860
What? I'm talking about activation. Activate.

140
00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:32.520
What on earth?

141
00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:35.920
Get up! Today, let's have you die too, along with Ma Wang.

142
00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:39.420
- Get up!
- What, what? What for?

143
00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:52.620
In the end, did Sam Jang end up like that?

144
00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.300
Come here. Hurry!

145
00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:00.150
Why? What's the matter?

146
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:05.420
Don't play any tricks in front of all the people, I mean demons.

147
00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:07.880
It's embarrassing.

148
00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.960
Is that so?

149
00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:12.750
Then I'll play tricks only when there's the two of us.

150
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:15.740
Don't do it even if it's just the two of us.

151
00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:18.570
Why? You don't have the confidence for fear that you'll be tempted?

152
00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:22.050
Yeah. I'm not confident.

153
00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:25.110
If you keep seducing me, I'm going to fall for it right away.

154
00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:29.070
Why are you like this all of a sudden? It's really nice.

155
00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:31.480
I'm embarrassed.

156
00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:37.680
Son Oh Gong, I was totally fooled by you.

157
00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:42.950
Later on, it'll end for you. I'll be left alone and miserable.

158
00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:47.930
Even though I know that, I like you more and more.

159
00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:51.690
I must be crazy.

160
00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:57.560
Be easy on me who has come to like you.

161
00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:08.130
Right now, right here, just the two of us is very dangerous to you?

162
00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:13.040
Yeah. It's dangerous. Don't do it.

163
00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:23.040
Alright. Since I agreed not to do anything you tell me not to do.

164
00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:25.600
Thanks.

165
00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:30.840
Then instead of playing tricks, can I show off?

166
00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:37.630
Wow! It's really nice here.

167
00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:41.220
Tell me whatever you want. I'll show everything to you.

168
00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:44.730
- If I just say it, I can see it all?
- Yeah.

169
00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:48.210
- Shall I show you stars?
- Yeah.

170
00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:58.230
Wow!

171
00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:39.340
Jin Seon Mi, I think I keep getting fooled too.

172
00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:45.640
Even if this disappears, I feel as if I'd be the same.

173
00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:48.800
I'm being crazy.

174
00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:50.520
What?

175
00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:54.030
- Just watch the stars.
- Okay.

176
00:14:57.940 --> 00:14:59.970
It's pretty.

177
00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:04.970
It was a good idea to keep her up there. I could've said something unnecessary.

178
00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:09.320
I'm also in danger. Me too.

<i>The corpse suddenly disappeared.</i>

183

She definitely died. But she came back to life again?

184
00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:55.990
Am I crazy?

185
00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:06.010
Unnie.

186
00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:11.410
- You're okay now, right?
- Yes.

187
00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:16.040
Unnie, I'm really sorry about that time in the car.

188
00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:22.210
<i>Unnie, I'm sorry.</i>

189
00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:26.390
I bit you.

190
00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:29.090
I'm also fine.

191
00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:32.490
You're not rotting further, right?

192
00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:37.530
Jeo Pal Gye keeps giving me energy beads, and he even got me preservatives.

193
00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:42.020
You'll be able to find out who you are. Let's not give up.

194
00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:44.060
Thank you.

195
00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:01.080
- Son Oh Gong.
- For what Pal Gye did to Sam Jang,

196
00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:04.410
if he had gotten caught by me, he would've died.

197
00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:06.510
It's all because of me.

198
00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:09.110
That's right, it's because of you.

199
00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:13.300
Zombie, you're continuing to rot, aren't you?

200
00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:17.800
Energy beads and preservatives have a limit.

201
00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:20.400
At any given moment, you'll lose consciousness.

202
00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:25.350
Then will Pal Gye try to capture a human again and get you to eat it?

203
00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:29.420
Then, that wouldn't do.

204
00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:32.800
Then you'll really become a monster.

205
00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:37.770
Sam Jang will be sad if you disappear without finding out who you are.

206
00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:42.410
But, if she has to get rid of you after you've become a monster,

207
00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:44.680
she'll be even sadder.

208
00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:50.810
I understand.

209
00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:54.130
I'll decide upon a reasonable time for me to disappear.

210
00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:11.830
Hyungnim, will Bu Ja not be able to make it for a long time?

211
00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:18.270
Everyone knows the stink due to her rotting is getting worse.

212
00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:25.010
Even though you know, you didn't turn on the heat,

213
00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:28.160
but turned on the air conditioning for her.

214
00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:31.850
I hate being cold.

215
00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:35.090
Letting the zombie live in luxury is over now.

216
00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:54.600
Sam Jang gave her heart to the Great Sage in the end.

217
00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.690
Sam Jang is more foolish than I thought.

218
00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:01.390
What is a human trying to accomplish by giving her heart to a demon?

219
00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:05.990
Sam Jang was dreaming of a happy ending.

220
00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:09.520
She said she saw a human and demon couple who were a match made in heaven.

221
00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:12.620
The Birth Grandmother arranged it through the ringing of the love bell.

222
00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:15.750
Did you say love bell?

223
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:18.760
By any chance, did you sell a love bell to Sam Jang?

224
00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:21.180
No. Why? Do you need a love bell?

225
00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:25.520
No. I'm curious if the love bell can ring between a human and a demon.

226
00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:27.720
I can't sell things in secret anymore.

227
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:32.770
The day Ma Wang caught me, I got scolded a lot by my grandmother for losing the death bell.

228
00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:35.290
Death bell?

229
00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:37.660
Because Sam Jang snitched on me that day,

230
00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:41.200
I lost the death bell because you chased me.

231
00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:46.960
That's right. That day. You said you lost the death bell that day.

232
00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:56.050
I also confessed that I liked him.

233
00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:58.060
There's nothing more to be embarrassed about.

234
00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:01.040
Shall I talk to him about us being a match made in heaven?

235
00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:13.720
If I tell him I heard the bell ring,

236
00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:16.240
will he believe me?

<i>[Korea Foundation for Culture and Arts Park Development]</i>

If we cut this down, they said they would pay 5 million won.

239
00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:41.360
Should I give it a try?

240
00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:43.350
This is divine.

241
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:47.390
Don't you know that everyone who has tampered with this tree has gotten into an accident and become strange?

242
00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:49.170
It must be coincidence.

243
00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:54.490
Last week, Kim, who took an ax to the tree, went crazy and stabbed a person!

244
00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:57.220
The incident with the knife at the torch relay site

245
00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:59.870
is due to him being bewitched by this tree!

246
00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:02.060
Forget about it!

247
00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:05.210
They said we have to cut down this tree in order to start construction.

248
00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:06.950
I'm going to cut it down and collect the 5 million won.

- I'm sorry.

Does he have any chance of waking up?

Hey, I was watching something. Why did you change the channel?

You already made up your mind to die. What's the use in watching that?

You did enough of "You pass!" Throw away any regrets.

Hey, what do you mean by Son's Kitchen? You're not even going to cook.

Why is it Son's Kitchen? It should be Woo's Kitchen.

280

That's right. Earlier, you used to cook 3 meals a day for me.

Since you cook well, let's call it Woo's Kitchen.

282

Of course, naturally it should be Woo's Kitchen.

Hey, why should I run a restaurant with you? Don't even dream of it.

Alright. I'll come over as a guest.

- There's a rumor about you spreading on SNS.

463
00:37:58.330 --> 00:38:02.050
I can throw them away in the bathtub, right? I'm going to toss them all out then.

464
00:38:18.970 --> 00:38:23.160
The first man who was possessed by the evil spirit and stabbed you was a construction worker.

465
00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:26.860
He worked at Professor Kang Dae Seong's Korea Foundation building construction site.

466
00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:29.540
I will go there with Sam Jang.

467
00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:34.190
I've got a bad feeling about this.

468
00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:39.850
Well, she's got Son Oh Gong so I'm sure nothing much will happen but...

469
00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:45.450
Ma Wang, there's something suspicious between Sam Jang and Son Oh Gong.

470
00:38:45.450 --> 00:38:50.680
- What is it?
- Do you remember the peddler's grandson saying he lost the Death Bell?

471
00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:52.500
Yeah, he did.

472
00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:56.750
I believe that Death Bell fell into Sam Jang's hands.

473
00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:02.670
The Death Bell is in Sam Jang's hands?

474
00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:08.690
By any chance, did the death bell ring?

475
00:39:08.690 --> 00:39:10.150
Yes.

476
00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:15.860
I think Sam Jang still doesn't know what it actually is.

477
00:39:17.830 --> 00:39:20.390
Damn it...

478
00:39:33.010 --> 00:39:37.660
Did Secretary Ma figure out that I have the Love Bell?

479
00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:41.450
Should I bring it to her and ask if it's the real deal?

480
00:39:56.470 --> 00:40:00.050
I'm going to your side right now. Count to ten.

481
00:40:38.090 --> 00:40:43.740
You're here? What's the occasion? You even sent a text in advance.

482
00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:46.470
I decided to go easy on you in many ways.

483
00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:50.810
If I suddenly appeared here during the night, you would get too excited. I can't let you die of happiness, right?

484
00:40:50.810 --> 00:40:52.810
I don't like you to the point that I'll die of happiness.

485
00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:56.720
Really? It will be soon.

486
00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:06.970
But why did you come?

487
00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:09.980
I had something to say to you.

488
00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:15.700
Do you prefer knowing really sad news in advance or after it's passed?

489
00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:19.600
It's something that will definitely happen and you can't prevent it even if you know about it.

490
00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:27.630
If it's something sad that will definitely happen, then knowing in advance will make it sad for a longer time.

491
00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:32.210
Okay. I'll tell you later.

492
00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:37.560
Do you want a drink? I was just about to make tea so you came at just the right time. Have some before you leave.

493
00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:41.610
Really? I can stay longer?

494
00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:44.390
Isn't this dangerous?

495
00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:48.580
Drinking tea together isn't enough to be dangerous!

496
00:41:49.370 --> 00:41:52.130
You must think you're some kind of homme fatale or something.

497
00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:57.290
How self-centered.

498
00:41:57.290 --> 00:42:01.690
It's nothing to her but it's super dangerous to me.

499
00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:01.880
Did he go because it really was dangerous?

500
00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:05.410
Did I say I'd do something to him?

501
00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:17.270
Yes, this is the Death Bell I lost. Thank you.

502
00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:19.070
But why did Sam Jang have that?

503
00:43:19.070 --> 00:43:23.350
Ah, so that noona picked it up that day.

504
00:43:23.350 --> 00:43:30.220
Hey, did that ring by any chance? Check it out.

505
00:43:35.350 --> 00:43:38.480
Yes. It already rang.

506
00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:49.310
Those two have a deadly fate between them?

507
00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:53.340
Son Oh Gong is eternally immortal.

508
00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:56.620
That stone monkey punk wouldn't die even if he was cooked.

509
00:43:56.620 --> 00:43:59.500
Literally, he's like a rock.

510
00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:02.480
How can a human like Sam Jang kill him?

511
00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:07.680
- In the meantime, Oh Gong's developed a fatal weakness.
- What?

512
00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:14.160
The Geumganggo has softened the stone monkey's heart.

513
00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:18.520
Then in order for Sam Jang's summons to be completed,

514
00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:23.350
is she going to kill Son Oh Gong? Or is she going to die by Son Oh Gong's hands?

515
00:44:23.350 --> 00:44:28.180
Since it's a deadly fate, it would have to be one of the two options, wouldn't it?

516
00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:34.030
No matter which it is, it's the punishment that's been given to the Great Sage by the Heavens.

517
00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:46.200
The Heavens still hasn't forgiven that arrogant Monkey?

518
00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:57.240
<i>That rascal has never felt true pain before.</i>

519
00:44:57.990 --> 00:45:02.900
<i>That angered the entire Heavens.</i>

520
00:45:05.530 --> 00:45:11.820
<i>He needs to feel real pain at least once in order to be forgiven.</i>

521
00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:34.140
Today, your cookies are even more delicious.

522
00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:36.240
They are, aren't they?

523
00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:41.580
I chose the recipe from the list of recommendations on the housewife site. I see it must taste all right.

524
00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:48.240
Sa Oh Jeong, thank you for making many delicious things for me.

525
00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:52.400
Have some more. I should upload a review.

526
00:46:07.550 --> 00:46:09.050
Here.

527
00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:25.210
Thank you for putting me often in icy mode so I won't rot.

528
00:46:25.210 --> 00:46:30.790
When spring comes, you'll need to ingest more coldness so come every day.

529
00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:37.100
Do you want to work part-time at my ice-cream shop?

530
00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:40.220
I'll consider it when spring comes.

531
00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:44.420
Would it be possible for me to meet with the Summer Fairy for a moment?

532
00:46:45.350 --> 00:46:48.590
She doesn't like being woken during the day.

533
00:46:48.590 --> 00:46:56.510
Nevermind. Then please be sure to tell her thank you for making me pretty.

534
00:46:56.510 --> 00:47:00.670
Bu Ja, is something wrong?

535
00:47:00.670 --> 00:47:05.320
No. The ice cream is really delicious!

536
00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:23.630
The two of you can't break up right now. Continue dating.

537
00:47:23.630 --> 00:47:25.510
The Pig is date-able enough for me.

538
00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:28.890
Why? Why? Why?! Why can't we break up?

539
00:47:28.890 --> 00:47:31.940
I mean, Ma Wang can die and come back to life however he pleases

540
00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:36.130
so why can't I break up with this octopus when I want to?

541
00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:40.240
Someone snapped a picture of you two again.

542
00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:42.840
It came out well.

543
00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:48.550
This is so unfair.

544
00:47:48.550 --> 00:47:52.230
Whenever she drinks, she becomes a mess.

545
00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:55.310
I, without a choice,

546
00:47:55.310 --> 00:47:58.700
didn't abandon her and took her to a hotel!

547
00:47:58.700 --> 00:48:00.780
Seriously, nothing happened with this Octopus!

548
00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:02.260
Okay.

549
00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:05.700
He's right. Nothing happened.

550
00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:09.480
The Pig was not a pig (was unable to function as a male sexually)

551
00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:11.800
This little octopus punk! Seriously!

552
00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:15.550
Hey, did I want to do something with you? Well? Did I?!

553
00:48:15.550 --> 00:48:19.720
- Come here!
- Wow, you're really unbelievable. Hey-what are doing!

554
00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:22.950
You must be kidding me...

555
00:48:25.570 --> 00:48:28.030
Bu Ja, what brings you here?

556
00:48:29.970 --> 00:48:32.730
Everyone looks busy.

557
00:48:32.730 --> 00:48:36.220
There was just a difference of opinions regarding a business problem.

558
00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:42.800
Secretary Ma, thank you for getting energy beads often for me.

559
00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:45.300
Bu Ja, did you come to practice?

560
00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:47.920
I'm not practicing today.

561
00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:52.120
Zombie, I see you stink less today.

562
00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:56.100
I just met with Winter General so I'm nice and icy right now.

563
00:48:56.100 --> 00:49:00.030
Prince, you should also go back to the dragon sea palace and make amends with your father.

564
00:49:00.030 --> 00:49:04.910
Alright. Before you rot further, I'll show you around the dragon sea palace.

565
00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:07.090
Thank you.

566
00:49:09.150 --> 00:49:14.860
Forget seeing the palace with the Octopus punk. Let's go to the amusement park today that we had agreed upon before.

567
00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:17.670
You have a couple photo-shoot to do today.

568
00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:19.730
We're going to break up.

569
00:49:19.730 --> 00:49:21.390
Let's go, Bu Ja!

570
00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:30.770
Shall we get something delicious to eat first? What do you want to eat?

571
00:49:30.770 --> 00:49:38.820
Beef? Ah, my nose hurts.... Ugh, that damn monkey always has to hit my nose.

572
00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:44.750
Did Son Oh Gong hit your nose because of me again?

573
00:49:44.750 --> 00:49:47.200
It was because of what happened last time.

574
00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:50.040
I'm fine. He didn't hit me that many times.

575
00:49:56.880 --> 00:50:00.180
Please don't try so hard because of me.

576
00:50:00.180 --> 00:50:04.100
I told you you're my younger brother. It's fine since we're brothers.

577
00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:06.830
Let's get something good to eat and then go have some fun.

578
00:50:06.830 --> 00:50:09.040
I have a prior engagement today.

579
00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:11.720
What prior engagement?

580
00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:15.530
Son Oh Gong is going to take me somewhere nice today.

581
00:50:15.530 --> 00:50:17.640
The Great Sage did?

582
00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:28.170
I told him to stop being mean to you. I guess he did some reflecting.

583
00:50:28.170 --> 00:50:32.860
Jeo Pal Gye, you're the one I'm most thankful towards.

584
00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:35.870
I was happy that you called me your younger brother.

585
00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:39.430
Me, too. I like my younger brother the most.

586
00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:48.200
Son Oh Gong will get mad again if I'm late. I'll get going.

587
00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:53.840
Have fun!

588
00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:56.470
Good-bye, Jeo Pal Gye!

589
00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:23.810
This land belongs to Kang Dae Seong of the Korea Foundation. Apparently, construction here has been halted because of this tree.

590
00:51:23.810 --> 00:51:27.720
Then does that mean that evil spirit came out because of this tree?

591
00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:31.820
I don't know. We'll find out once we call it out.

592
00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:34.920
Call it out with your blood.

593
00:51:42.270 --> 00:51:46.140
I guess they're going to cut down the divine tree after all.

594
00:51:56.550 --> 00:51:58.730
Where are you going in the middle of snack time?

595
00:51:58.730 --> 00:52:00.390
Why's he...?

596
00:52:05.770 --> 00:52:08.890
Keep your hands off the tree!

597
00:52:08.890 --> 00:52:11.020
Stop!

598
00:52:12.660 --> 00:52:14.830
Sam Jang, is this the person?

599
00:52:14.830 --> 00:52:20.060
Yes. He's the man that was possessed by an evil spirit that I saw at the hospital.

600
00:52:36.570 --> 00:52:41.270
No... No...

601
00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:43.430
No...

602
00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:53.760
I've been a protector for over 1,000 years.

603
00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:59.300
You foolish humans! From now on it's your responsibility!

604
00:53:09.990 --> 00:53:12.910
It looks like the evil spirit disappeared.

605
00:53:12.910 --> 00:53:16.150
The tree has become quiet as well.

606
00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:18.930
Good work, Sam Jang. Let's go.

607
00:53:18.930 --> 00:53:26.420
But, what do you think he meant earlier about being a protector for over 1,000 years?

608
00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:29.360
This tree must be over 1,000 years old.

609
00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:33.180
Since that evil spirit had been attached to it for a very long time.

610
00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:38.230
What we got rid of was really an evil spirit, right?

611
00:53:40.740 --> 00:53:46.140
In any case, that man has become normal again and the construction will restart soon.

612
00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:47.990
Let's go.

613
00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:58.280
Hey! Look here, Mr. Park!

614
00:53:58.280 --> 00:54:00.890
Get him up! What's the matter with him?

615
00:54:00.890 --> 00:54:02.910
Hurry!

616
00:54:02.910 --> 00:54:04.610
Are you okay?

617
00:54:06.330 --> 00:54:07.960
What? Did something happen?

618
00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:12.840
This guy...! Wow, I'm speechless. Let's go.

619
00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:15.390
What was all that about?

620
00:54:25.950 --> 00:54:33.000
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to you by

621
00:54:40.350 --> 00:54:46.360
It's been decided I'm going to burn Bu Ja. I figured I should let you know.

622
00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:48.090
Sam Jang is going to be sad.

623
00:54:48.090 --> 00:54:51.070
It's better than letting her see her become an evil spirit.

624
00:54:51.070 --> 00:54:54.580
I want to shorten her grieving time by telling her later.

625
00:54:54.580 --> 00:54:58.870
Seeing as you've gone so far now as to think about Sam Jang's grief,

626
00:54:58.870 --> 00:55:04.920
your heart really must have gone soft.

627
00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:11.760
Yeah, if I make a mistake, she could really kill me.

628
00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:15.210
How could a human possibly kill the Great Sage?

629
00:55:15.210 --> 00:55:21.270
Why are you playing the fool? You already know about the Death Bell, don't you?

630
00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:27.070
I heard all about Secretary Ma asking about it from the peddler's grandson.

631
00:55:27.070 --> 00:55:33.280
You knew that Sam Jang had the Death Bell?

632
00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:34.860
Yeah.

633
00:55:39.250 --> 00:55:41.580
And he said it's already rung.

634
00:55:42.820 --> 00:55:50.770
Then you also know that one of you will kill and one will die, don't you?

635
00:55:51.650 --> 00:55:59.790
As long as I've got the Geumganggo on me, I can never kill her. Then is she really going to kill me?

636
00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:07.190
You haven't by chance actually prepared yourself to be killed by her, have you?

637
00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:13.720
Who's to say. If I don't want to die then I'd have to use whatever means possible.

638
00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:18.380
I'd need to get of Sam Jang first, wouldn't I?

639
00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:33.580
What should I do when a woman who may possibly kill me is that pretty?

640
00:56:33.580 --> 00:56:37.100
If she's that pretty to you, there's nothing you can do.

641
00:56:37.100 --> 00:56:41.430
Are you going to die by Sam Jang's hands?

642
00:56:42.190 --> 00:56:46.260
Ma Wang, don't worry too much about me.

643
00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:49.450
I'll never die.

644
00:56:49.450 --> 00:56:53.260
I'm not worried about you. Whether you die or not.

645
00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:59.930
Bu Ja will be coming to see you later. Don't be a softie and cry.

646
00:56:59.930 --> 00:57:01.920
Hey, dog secretary!

647
00:57:03.100 --> 00:57:05.930
How can you go around without a scarf when it's so cold outside?

648
00:57:05.930 --> 00:57:07.860
I'm fine.

649
00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:13.520
- Let's go eat.
- Okay.

650
00:57:18.550 --> 00:57:21.560
The evil spirit has been taken care of.

651
00:57:21.560 --> 00:57:25.590
Son Oh Gong knew about the Death Bell.

652
00:57:25.590 --> 00:57:27.730
Really?

653
00:57:27.730 --> 00:57:32.030
And yet he's talking to Sam Jang nonchalantly like that?

654
00:57:32.030 --> 00:57:35.370
He said he'll never die.

655
00:57:35.370 --> 00:57:43.310
I know the Great Sage. That rascal will definitely get rid of Sam Jang first.

656
00:57:58.410 --> 00:58:00.350
Love?

657
00:58:01.230 --> 00:58:06.950
A mere thing like that will never be able to win him over.

658
00:58:08.090 --> 00:58:09.930
Did something happen?

659
00:58:09.930 --> 00:58:11.730
Nope.

660
00:58:35.780 --> 00:58:41.350
I smell pretty bad, don't I? I'm sorry.

661
00:58:41.350 --> 00:58:45.210
Miss, by chance, isn't your name Jung Se Ra?

662
00:58:45.210 --> 00:58:50.200

665
00:58:59.650 --> 00:59:03.290
What do you want to do? Are you going to take it to the hospital room she was moved to?

666
00:59:03.290 --> 00:59:07.720
There's nothing worth taking to her. We can just throw it out.

667
00:59:10.970 --> 00:59:13.630
The power was still on.

668
00:59:13.630 --> 00:59:19.920
Even though she was hurting and sick, she must have kept it charged in case a call from her daughter came.

669
00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:31.720
The woman that was hospitalized here would cry every day over her missing daughter.

670

There used to be a lot of pictures over there.

When I cut my hand on the leaf, my blood dripped onto the ground and it shook.

Did something strange come out?

695
01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:55.980
No. It quickly became quiet and the evil spirit that was latched onto the tree disappeared.

696
01:01:56.700 --> 01:02:00.470
Be careful. Sam Jang's blood can awaken very annoying things.

697
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:05.820
The reason my blood was able to gain that ability is because of you.

698
01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:12.630
Because I set you free and I became Sam Jang, even if it awakens annoying things, that's all because of you.

699
01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:20.300
That's right. From now on, everything that happens to you is because of me.

What the heck?

702

Underneath the place where the tree was cut, this was found.

703
01:02:57.990 --> 01:03:00.510
It's a stone coffin. There wasn't anything else?

704
01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:06.000
No, there wasn't. In case it might cause a problem during construction, I quietly took it out.

705
01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:08.620
Good job.

706
01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:12.580
By any chance, is this a relic?

Yes, sir.

- I leave the future of the construction in your care.
- Yes.

What is it?

711
01:04:12.250 --> 01:04:18.520
There won't be further problems on the construction site. What shall I do with this stone coffin?

712
01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:20.630

Go ahead first. There's something I need to take care of.

714

About that sad matter that you mentioned earlier, it keeps bothering me.

715
01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:29.220
If you know in advance, it'll make you sadder for a longer period of time.

There are things that you need to be very sad about.

For some reason, I think I need to do that, so I must know.

721
01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:56.740

722
01:05:58.210 --> 01:06:01.060
I told her I would do it for her.
