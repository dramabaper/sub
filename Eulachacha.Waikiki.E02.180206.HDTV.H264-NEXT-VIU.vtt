1
00:00:10.941 --> 00:00:12.773
Don't worry I'm fine

2
00:00:12.826 --> 00:00:14.535
Don't feel pressured

3
00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:17.935
I don't have a boyfriend either

4
00:00:18.036 --> 00:00:21.736
But why aren't you say anything?

5
00:00:21.775 --> 00:00:24.475
You are too much of an idealist

6
00:00:24.475 --> 00:00:26.205
There's no such girls

7
00:00:26.205 --> 00:00:29.716
Who will talk to you first

8
00:00:29.716 --> 00:00:31.286
Just by looking at your eyes

9
00:00:31.286 --> 00:00:33.046
You are one of those guys

10
00:00:33.046 --> 00:00:35.186
Like now

11
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:47.596
Gosh, it hurts.

12
00:00:49.035 --> 00:00:50.866
Are you happy?

13
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:53.406
Did you sleep well, Sol?

14
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:55.535
- Did you sleep well? - Yes.

15
00:00:55.535 --> 00:00:57.705
- You're up early. - Good morning, Yoon Ah.

16
00:00:57.705 --> 00:00:59.005
Good...

17
00:01:00.175 --> 00:01:02.215
Don't be surprised. He does that every day.

18
00:01:02.416 --> 00:01:03.846
What's that called?

19
00:01:04.116 --> 00:01:07.555
- Gr... - Grooming, you idiot.

20
00:01:07.555 --> 00:01:09.486
Guys should try to look good too these days.

21
00:01:10.055 --> 00:01:13.686
Yoon Ah, I'm actually an actor.

22
00:01:13.826 --> 00:01:14.925
An actor.

23
00:01:15.195 --> 00:01:17.766
You're an actor? That's so cool.

24
00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:19.766
You call yourself an actor?

25
00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:22.895
You always stand in the back without a single lime.

26
00:01:23.565 --> 00:01:26.906
That's so kind of you, Writer Bong.

27
00:01:27.136 --> 00:01:28.376
Are you a writer?

28
00:01:28.376 --> 00:01:30.035
What kind of stuff do you write?

29
00:01:30.205 --> 00:01:32.675
I write novels.

30
00:01:32.675 --> 00:01:34.346
I also write a novel that gets published online.

31
00:01:34.346 --> 00:01:36.516
But my ultimate goal is to write scripts.

32
00:01:36.516 --> 00:01:38.016
Dream on.

33
00:01:38.145 --> 00:01:41.055
All you ever do is write resumes for other people.

34
00:01:41.555 --> 00:01:44.115
He even wrote a speech...

35
00:01:44.115 --> 00:01:47.925
for a kid for a bag of chips once.

36
00:01:47.925 --> 00:01:49.596
What kind of writer...

37
00:01:49.596 --> 00:01:52.326
- works with such trivial things? - Are you done?

38
00:01:52.326 --> 00:01:54.496
- You're no writer. - Stop it.

39
00:01:54.695 --> 00:01:57.705
You two are just the same.

40
00:01:57.705 --> 00:01:59.766
We're at least better than you.

41
00:01:59.766 --> 00:02:01.305
You set the movie set on fire...

42
00:02:01.305 --> 00:02:04.205
while trying to roast sweet potatoes and got kicked out.

43
00:02:05.205 --> 00:02:06.645
Why do you bring that up now?

44
00:02:07.046 --> 00:02:08.615
Also, it was potatoes, not sweet potatoes.

45
00:02:08.615 --> 00:02:11.216
It doesn't change the fact that you started a fire.

46
00:02:11.216 --> 00:02:12.616
They're different.

47
00:02:12.616 --> 00:02:15.456
Sweet potatoes is 2 words while potatoes is 1 word.

48
00:02:15.456 --> 00:02:17.855
The number of words doesn't matter. I'm talking about a fire.

49
00:02:17.855 --> 00:02:19.026
Sweet potatoes and potatoes are different.

50
00:02:19.026 --> 00:02:21.795
Why do you have to get on my nerves from the morning?

51
00:02:21.795 --> 00:02:24.195
What's wrong? Please calm down.

52
00:02:24.565 --> 00:02:26.665
Why would you tell everyone?

53
00:02:26.665 --> 00:02:29.195
- I'm taking your side right now. - What are you talking about?

54
00:02:29.195 --> 00:02:30.366
Be quiet!

55
00:02:30.795 --> 00:02:32.665
You guys are so childish.

56
00:02:32.665 --> 00:02:33.765
Please be understanding.

57
00:02:33.765 --> 00:02:36.206
The men in this house are a bit weird.

58
00:02:37.206 --> 00:02:38.975
What? Weird?

59
00:02:38.975 --> 00:02:42.045
You're the weirdest one here, Chewbacca.

60
00:02:42.045 --> 00:02:44.146
Chewbacca? What's that?

61
00:02:44.146 --> 00:02:46.515
Don't you know the furry animal in "Star Wars"...

62
00:02:46.686 --> 00:02:48.855
Just a second. Here it is.

63
00:02:49.755 --> 00:02:50.926
Chewbacca.

64
00:02:51.755 --> 00:02:54.156
Why do you call her "Chewbacca"?

65
00:02:54.156 --> 00:02:56.456
Both Seo Jin and Chewbacca...

66
00:02:56.456 --> 00:02:59.225
Don't you dare tell her.

67
00:02:59.225 --> 00:03:00.695
I won't.

68
00:03:02.096 --> 00:03:03.336
Chewbacca!

69
00:03:03.795 --> 00:03:05.065
Chewbacca!

70
00:03:05.065 --> 00:03:07.005
Are you serious? Stop it.

71
00:03:07.635 --> 00:03:10.575
- Hey. - Calm down.

72
00:03:10.575 --> 00:03:12.445
You brat.

73
00:03:12.445 --> 00:03:14.146
- I hate both of you. - Come on.

74
00:03:14.545 --> 00:03:16.346
They're so weird.

75
00:03:17.146 --> 00:03:20.915
Was it a good idea to stay here?

76
00:03:22.015 --> 00:03:23.116
Will you stop?

77
00:03:24.015 --> 00:03:25.686
Sol, are you hungry?

78
00:03:25.686 --> 00:03:27.086
Do you want to eat?

79
00:03:27.485 --> 00:03:29.325
Sol, I'll give you some milk.

80
00:03:29.325 --> 00:03:31.065
Are you hungry?

81
00:03:31.195 --> 00:03:33.195
It's time for milk.

82
00:03:34.065 --> 00:03:35.135
Gosh.

83
00:03:35.565 --> 00:03:37.496
- She's the weirdest one. - You're right.

84
00:03:37.496 --> 00:03:38.936
What's with her?

85
00:03:39.605 --> 00:03:42.306
(Anyone Can Become A Wolverine)

86
00:03:45.445 --> 00:03:49.116
Should we start cleaning?

87
00:03:49.315 --> 00:03:52.716
Yes. Seo Jin will come and take a look soon.

88
00:03:52.945 --> 00:03:55.285
Let's start before we get in trouble.

89
00:03:55.285 --> 00:03:59.825
But I'm not sure if it's necessary that all three of us clean.

90
00:04:00.126 --> 00:04:01.596
So...

91
00:04:02.956 --> 00:04:04.225
why don't we make a bet?

92
00:04:04.825 --> 00:04:05.966
What kind of bet?

93
00:04:09.466 --> 00:04:14.575
Are you saying you can put on the pants without using hands?

94
00:04:14.575 --> 00:04:15.836
That's absurd.

95
00:04:15.936 --> 00:04:18.175
- It's impossible. - I know.

96
00:04:19.146 --> 00:04:23.545
If I fail, I'll clean the whole place alone.

97
00:04:23.675 --> 00:04:26.415
If I succeed, I don't have to clean.

98
00:04:26.646 --> 00:04:28.185
Deal?

99
00:04:28.285 --> 00:04:29.456
- Deal. - Deal.

100
00:04:39.466 --> 00:04:40.896
Here we go.

101
00:04:40.896 --> 00:04:41.995
You have 30 seconds.

102
00:04:47.266 --> 00:04:48.406
It's not going to work.

103
00:04:52.076 --> 00:04:53.206
Wait.

104
00:04:53.706 --> 00:04:55.076
Hold on.

105
00:04:55.846 --> 00:04:56.915
What's happening?

106
00:04:57.076 --> 00:04:58.915
- What are you doing? - Is this really possible?

107
00:05:01.355 --> 00:05:02.485
What's going on?

108
00:05:03.716 --> 00:05:04.855
What is this?

109
00:05:05.256 --> 00:05:06.355
What are you doing?

110
00:05:08.026 --> 00:05:10.555
I told you to clean the place. What are you up to now?

111
00:05:10.555 --> 00:05:12.125
- I was about to start. - So was I.

112
00:05:12.896 --> 00:05:15.165
Guys!

113
00:05:15.165 --> 00:05:17.466
I succeeded. I don't have to clean.

114
00:05:18.105 --> 00:05:19.636
Don't have to clean, my foot.

115
00:05:19.636 --> 00:05:21.535
- Follow me. - I don't have to clean.

116
00:05:21.535 --> 00:05:24.006
I succeeded. I don't have to.

117
00:05:29.276 --> 00:05:30.545
Gosh, I'm tired.

118
00:05:30.816 --> 00:05:33.516
With more guests, we have more cleaning to do.

119
00:05:33.516 --> 00:05:35.785
Goodness, it wasn't that much. Stop complaining.

120
00:05:36.555 --> 00:05:37.886
Hurry up.

121
00:05:37.886 --> 00:05:39.526
It's almost time for the customers to check-in.

122
00:05:39.526 --> 00:05:40.555
Fine.

123
00:05:40.555 --> 00:05:42.495
Aren't you going to the library today?

124
00:05:42.495 --> 00:05:44.566
- Do you want to slack off? - No.

125
00:05:45.396 --> 00:05:48.136
You're graduating soon. How is the job hunt going?

126
00:05:48.235 --> 00:05:50.735
Well... I wish it was going well.

127
00:05:51.035 --> 00:05:53.706
I'm doing my best, but it's not easy.

128
00:05:53.766 --> 00:05:55.535
It's hard for everyone these days.

129
00:05:56.206 --> 00:05:57.336
Cheer up.

130
00:05:57.506 --> 00:05:59.406
You're such a big help though.

131
00:05:59.506 --> 00:06:00.946
Don't say that.

132
00:06:01.576 --> 00:06:04.146
To think that I might end up like you if I slack off,

133
00:06:04.146 --> 00:06:05.745
encourages me to push forward.

134
00:06:05.946 --> 00:06:07.045
Thanks.

135
00:06:09.756 --> 00:06:10.956
Gosh.

136
00:06:14.425 --> 00:06:15.656
What are you doing?

137
00:06:15.826 --> 00:06:17.625
Are you going to vacuum all day?

138
00:06:17.865 --> 00:06:20.725
Gather and wash all the sheets, and clean the rooftop too.

139
00:06:20.725 --> 00:06:22.535
Also, put away the Christmas tree.

140
00:06:22.665 --> 00:06:26.136
- Christmas was months ago. - Fine. Stop nagging.

141
00:06:26.836 --> 00:06:28.206
I'm already depressed.

142
00:06:28.276 --> 00:06:29.576
Why are you depressed?

143
00:06:29.805 --> 00:06:31.946
- Soo Ah and I broke up. - I know.

144
00:06:32.305 --> 00:06:35.375
In addition to getting dumped, you got caught while selling your ring.

145
00:06:35.545 --> 00:06:38.346
But you're still not over her and can't stop bothering her.

146
00:06:38.346 --> 00:06:39.785
- Who said that? - Jun Ki.

147
00:06:39.785 --> 00:06:41.516
He has such a big mouth.

148
00:06:41.516 --> 00:06:44.326
Once a girl turns her back, it's over. Get over her.

149
00:06:44.326 --> 00:06:46.285
We were together for four years.

150
00:06:46.285 --> 00:06:47.795
We can't break up this easily.

151
00:06:47.795 --> 00:06:48.925
I can't accept it.

152
00:06:48.925 --> 00:06:51.625
- Then talk to her. - She won't let me see her.

153
00:06:51.625 --> 00:06:52.925
She ignores my calls and texts.

154
00:06:52.925 --> 00:06:54.535
She avoids me even if I come to see her.

155
00:06:54.535 --> 00:06:56.766
She must be determined.

156
00:06:56.766 --> 00:06:58.235
How can she do this to me?

157
00:06:58.235 --> 00:07:01.576
Do you think I'm unreliable...

158
00:07:01.675 --> 00:07:03.206
and have no future?

159
00:07:03.206 --> 00:07:06.276
What? Oh, I'm late.

160
00:07:06.276 --> 00:07:08.776
- For what? - I have to go to the library. Bye.

161
00:07:10.816 --> 00:07:11.886
Gosh.

162
00:07:13.016 --> 00:07:15.156
Even my only sister looks down on me.

163
00:07:17.785 --> 00:07:19.086
I'm exhausted.

164
00:07:19.326 --> 00:07:21.555
I might die from working too hard.

165
00:07:21.995 --> 00:07:24.625
You must be tired. Do you want something to drink?

166
00:07:24.625 --> 00:07:25.966
- Sure. - I'm okay.

167
00:07:26.596 --> 00:07:28.865
- Stop putting on makeup. - Hey.

168
00:07:29.235 --> 00:07:33.266
T-zone becomes oily fast. It needs touch-ups.

169
00:07:33.266 --> 00:07:36.105
Also, I have a movie shoot today.

170
00:07:36.105 --> 00:07:37.305
What movie is it?

171
00:07:37.305 --> 00:07:38.545
You know the movie, "X-Men", right?

172
00:07:38.545 --> 00:07:41.016
This is like the Korean version of that movie.

173
00:07:41.016 --> 00:07:43.545
It's about a fight between humans and mutants.

174
00:07:43.716 --> 00:07:44.846
Who plays the main character?

175
00:07:45.816 --> 00:07:46.946
Zo In Sung.

176
00:07:48.216 --> 00:07:50.785
It's going to be a hit.

177
00:07:50.785 --> 00:07:52.355
Then what happens?

178
00:07:52.456 --> 00:07:54.355
I'll be a star.

179
00:07:54.355 --> 00:07:55.756
And then?

180
00:07:55.925 --> 00:07:59.696
I won't have to see these gloomy faces anymore.

181
00:08:00.295 --> 00:08:02.035
The star will get going now.

182
00:08:02.865 --> 00:08:04.035
See you.

183
00:08:05.066 --> 00:08:06.266
See you.

184
00:08:08.136 --> 00:08:09.276
Gosh.

185
00:08:09.636 --> 00:08:11.245
Are you okay? Aren't you hurt?

186
00:08:11.446 --> 00:08:12.975
I'm okay.

187
00:08:13.206 --> 00:08:15.846
Be more careful.

188
00:08:15.915 --> 00:08:17.076
I'm sorry.

189
00:08:20.185 --> 00:08:24.425
Look. I haven't given you my permission to stay here yet.

190
00:08:24.886 --> 00:08:26.925
If you don't become much help,

191
00:08:26.925 --> 00:08:28.855
I'll send you away.

192
00:08:29.156 --> 00:08:31.696
Don't worry. I'll work hard.

193
00:08:44.105 --> 00:08:46.946
Go to your baby. I'll clean up here.

194
00:08:47.745 --> 00:08:48.916
I'm sorry.

195
00:08:48.916 --> 00:08:50.816
Give me the gloves before you go.

196
00:08:51.115 --> 00:08:52.245
Right.

197
00:08:58.355 --> 00:09:02.225
Oh, no. My goodness.

198
00:09:02.225 --> 00:09:05.025
- I'm sorry. - The soap!

199
00:09:06.865 --> 00:09:09.436
From the morning...

200
00:09:09.436 --> 00:09:13.306
- I'm sorry. - Stop apologizing, and just go.

201
00:09:13.635 --> 00:09:14.775
I'm so...

202
00:09:15.605 --> 00:09:18.076
I'm sorry.

203
00:09:18.405 --> 00:09:20.645
Gosh.

204
00:09:22.515 --> 00:09:24.946
I don't like her. I really don't like her.

205
00:09:24.946 --> 00:09:27.115
Her baby distracted her.

206
00:09:27.385 --> 00:09:29.385
You've been on edge lately.

207
00:09:30.255 --> 00:09:31.586
Is it about Soo Ah?

208
00:09:33.956 --> 00:09:35.725
- No, it's not. - It is.

209
00:09:35.725 --> 00:09:37.995
- It's written all over your face. - No!

210
00:09:38.196 --> 00:09:39.326
I said no!

211
00:09:39.326 --> 00:09:42.796
Why don't you listen to me? Gosh, you're so annoying.

212
00:09:43.336 --> 00:09:44.466
You clean up here.

213
00:09:45.605 --> 00:09:47.505
Gosh, this is annoying.

214
00:09:47.875 --> 00:09:50.206
Why does he always take it out on me?

215
00:09:50.206 --> 00:09:51.375
I can hear you!

216
00:09:54.975 --> 00:09:56.076
Director.

217
00:09:56.076 --> 00:09:58.816
- Is everything ready? - Yes, almost.

218
00:10:00.586 --> 00:10:02.216
Radioactive mutant!

219
00:10:13.265 --> 00:10:14.466
Where are you?

220
00:10:17.706 --> 00:10:19.405
- Hello, sir. - Hi.

221
00:10:20.666 --> 00:10:22.676
I love your makeup. It looks perfect.

222
00:10:22.836 --> 00:10:25.875
We'll start as soon as In Sung comes. Be on standby.

223
00:10:25.875 --> 00:10:27.005
Okay.

224
00:10:27.076 --> 00:10:29.015
Where's the genetic mutant?

225
00:10:29.546 --> 00:10:30.916
Genetic mutant!

226
00:10:31.686 --> 00:10:32.716
Hello.

227
00:10:32.716 --> 00:10:34.755
What? Really?

228
00:10:35.855 --> 00:10:37.155
We're in trouble.

229
00:10:37.586 --> 00:10:38.586
I got it.

230
00:10:38.755 --> 00:10:41.155
- My goodness. - What's wrong?

231
00:10:41.155 --> 00:10:43.025
In Sung got into a car accident on his way here.

232
00:10:43.025 --> 00:10:44.796
He's in the hospital.

233
00:10:44.995 --> 00:10:47.125
What about the shoot?

234
00:10:47.125 --> 00:10:48.365
Isn't it obvious?

235
00:10:48.365 --> 00:10:50.196
We can't shoot without the main actor.

236
00:10:50.536 --> 00:10:52.735
Assistant Director?

237
00:10:52.735 --> 00:10:54.005
What should I do?

238
00:10:54.005 --> 00:10:56.576
Remove the makeup for now. Tomorrow...

239
00:10:56.576 --> 00:10:58.806
What? He can't remove it.

240
00:10:58.806 --> 00:11:00.105
It costs a lot.

241
00:11:00.105 --> 00:11:02.716
Keep the makeup...

242
00:11:02.716 --> 00:11:04.446
and come back tomorrow. Got it?

243
00:11:04.446 --> 00:11:07.086
Do I stay like this?

244
00:11:07.216 --> 00:11:09.186
If you mess up the makeup,

245
00:11:09.186 --> 00:11:11.826
I'll get rid of your role, okay?

246
00:11:12.255 --> 00:11:14.426
- I... - Darn it.

247
00:11:14.926 --> 00:11:16.225
Get rid of my role?

248
00:11:16.655 --> 00:11:18.995
The shoot is canceled today.

249
00:11:18.995 --> 00:11:21.296
What? Where is everyone going?

250
00:11:21.566 --> 00:11:24.365
How can I keep this makeup on?

251
00:11:24.365 --> 00:11:25.635
Wait.

252
00:11:32.176 --> 00:11:33.605
Hello.

253
00:11:41.755 --> 00:11:42.816
What's going on?

254
00:11:42.816 --> 00:11:43.985
What is that?

255
00:11:43.985 --> 00:11:45.725
- Gosh. - Who is he?

256
00:11:51.166 --> 00:11:52.926
This is embarrassing.

257
00:11:54.025 --> 00:11:56.166
Why is there so many people?

258
00:12:01.605 --> 00:12:04.375
I can't mess up the makeup.

259
00:12:05.405 --> 00:12:06.505
What's going on?

260
00:12:31.105 --> 00:12:32.265
Excuse me.

261
00:12:33.005 --> 00:12:34.905
You should be more careful.

262
00:12:40.475 --> 00:12:41.816
- Hi. - Hi.

263
00:12:44.816 --> 00:12:45.985
Gosh.

264
00:12:46.086 --> 00:12:48.586
I told her to clean up the towels, but she left them here.

265
00:12:48.586 --> 00:12:51.086
Can't she do anything right?

266
00:12:51.086 --> 00:12:52.225
Goodness.

267
00:12:52.985 --> 00:12:54.596
- Dong Gu. - Yes?

268
00:12:54.596 --> 00:12:57.296
Gosh, what are you?

269
00:12:58.125 --> 00:12:59.225
It's me.

270
00:12:59.895 --> 00:13:01.995
Jun Ki? Why do you look like that?

271
00:13:02.395 --> 00:13:04.936
The shoot was canceled because the main actor got into an accident.

272
00:13:05.235 --> 00:13:07.005
The director told him...

273
00:13:07.005 --> 00:13:09.536
to keep the makeup for tomorrow to save the cost.

274
00:13:09.875 --> 00:13:13.005
You live such a hard life.

275
00:13:13.105 --> 00:13:14.346
That's enough.

276
00:13:14.816 --> 00:13:16.816
I'm already embarrassed.

277
00:13:25.725 --> 00:13:28.025
Can you put the phone on my ear?

278
00:13:30.355 --> 00:13:32.765
Hello? This is Lee Jun Ki.

279
00:13:34.436 --> 00:13:35.735
What, the police?

280
00:13:35.735 --> 00:13:39.365
We caught a pickpocket and found your wallet on him.

281
00:13:39.365 --> 00:13:41.436
My wallet? Hold on, please.

282
00:13:42.576 --> 00:13:45.446
What? Who stole my wallet?

283
00:13:46.405 --> 00:13:49.245
Yes, I'll be right there.

284
00:13:49.775 --> 00:13:51.346
- Hang up. - Wait.

285
00:13:51.446 --> 00:13:52.546
Are you going like that?

286
00:13:52.546 --> 00:13:55.115
What else can I do? My ID, credit card, and money...

287
00:13:55.115 --> 00:13:56.286
There's no money.

288
00:13:56.816 --> 00:13:59.686
That jerk. You're done for.

289
00:14:00.686 --> 00:14:03.826
Gosh, there's no one normal around here.

290
00:14:05.966 --> 00:14:07.025
What's going on?

291
00:14:07.265 --> 00:14:09.436
Who left the refrigerator door open?

292
00:14:13.036 --> 00:14:14.875
What if everything spoils?

293
00:14:16.936 --> 00:14:19.375
Is she the one who did it?

294
00:14:19.806 --> 00:14:21.716
Yoon Ah. Yoon Ah!

295
00:14:24.076 --> 00:14:25.946
Yes, did you call me?

296
00:14:25.946 --> 00:14:27.015
Did you...

297
00:14:27.515 --> 00:14:28.816
do this?

298
00:14:28.816 --> 00:14:31.355
I was cleaning the fridge when I heard her cry.

299
00:14:31.956 --> 00:14:33.826
- I'll clean up now. - Forget it.

300
00:14:33.985 --> 00:14:35.196
Take care of Sol first.

301
00:14:37.326 --> 00:14:40.365
What are these? Did mushrooms grow on mushrooms?

302
00:14:40.395 --> 00:14:42.765
- Please throw these away. - Okay.

303
00:14:43.196 --> 00:14:45.235
Did you eat well? Sol.

304
00:14:45.235 --> 00:14:47.735
- Let's sleep. - Please do a better job.

305
00:14:47.735 --> 00:14:50.005
- I'm sorry. - If you're really sorry,

306
00:14:50.005 --> 00:14:52.605
don't cause trouble again.

307
00:14:52.806 --> 00:14:54.105
What's wrong? What happened?

308
00:14:54.105 --> 00:14:56.015
This is all your fault.

309
00:14:56.275 --> 00:14:59.216
You and Jun Ki. What kind of place is this?

310
00:14:59.885 --> 00:15:00.985
I'm the bad guy.

311
00:15:01.255 --> 00:15:02.916
Why is he taking it out on me?

312
00:15:02.916 --> 00:15:05.255
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

313
00:15:05.355 --> 00:15:06.426
It's okay.

314
00:15:07.326 --> 00:15:09.056
I'll take Sol.

315
00:15:09.056 --> 00:15:11.696
I'll take care of her. You should clean up first.

316
00:15:11.696 --> 00:15:13.666
I still feel terrible.

317
00:15:13.666 --> 00:15:14.666
It's okay.

318
00:15:15.096 --> 00:15:16.735
I don't have much to do before work.

319
00:15:16.895 --> 00:15:20.806
Besides Sol likes me very much.

320
00:15:21.536 --> 00:15:22.806
Right, Sol?

321
00:15:29.975 --> 00:15:32.745
You like me so much that you barfed on me.

322
00:15:42.196 --> 00:15:44.725
Let's not make a big deal out of it.

323
00:15:44.725 --> 00:15:46.566
Be nice and let me go.

324
00:15:47.166 --> 00:15:49.865
Do you want to get hit, you punk?

325
00:15:50.096 --> 00:15:51.566
Excuse me.

326
00:15:51.566 --> 00:15:52.765
How can I help you?

327
00:15:54.806 --> 00:15:55.806
What's this?

328
00:15:56.005 --> 00:15:57.375
Who are you?

329
00:15:57.375 --> 00:15:59.446
I came after a call.

330
00:15:59.446 --> 00:16:01.846
I'm Lee Jun Ki. I heard that my wallet is here.

331
00:16:02.546 --> 00:16:03.676
Please move the gun away.

332
00:16:05.115 --> 00:16:07.485
Are you the victim whom I spoke with?

333
00:16:07.485 --> 00:16:09.416
- Yes. - You startled me.

334
00:16:09.416 --> 00:16:11.125
What's wrong with your face?

335
00:16:12.786 --> 00:16:16.225
I'm an actor, but the shoot was postponed.

336
00:16:16.225 --> 00:16:18.826
You told me that my wallet is here. Where is it?

337
00:16:18.926 --> 00:16:20.596
- There it is. - Wait, sir.

338
00:16:20.796 --> 00:16:22.296
Let me check your identification.

339
00:16:22.536 --> 00:16:23.796
Let's see.

340
00:16:24.235 --> 00:16:25.635
"Lee Jun Ki".

341
00:16:28.336 --> 00:16:29.875
Are you Lee Jun Ki?

342
00:16:29.875 --> 00:16:31.806
Yes, that's me. Take a look.

343
00:16:32.605 --> 00:16:35.176
You look like your picture, but I can't be sure.

344
00:16:35.645 --> 00:16:38.416
Take a close look. It's me. I look the same.

345
00:16:38.416 --> 00:16:41.716
I can't verify because of the makeup. Can you remove it?

346
00:16:41.716 --> 00:16:44.015
No, if I mess it up, I'll lose my role.

347
00:16:45.186 --> 00:16:47.025
Let's check the fingerprint. Give me your finger.

348
00:16:47.025 --> 00:16:48.096
Fingerprint?

349
00:16:51.495 --> 00:16:53.596
Can I pull out the hair?

350
00:16:53.596 --> 00:16:56.096
No, if you mess it up, I'll lose my role.

351
00:16:56.096 --> 00:16:57.905
What else can I do?

352
00:16:57.905 --> 00:17:00.635
Can I get a DNA test? You can draw my blood.

353
00:17:00.635 --> 00:17:03.536
Run a DNA test to identify you?

354
00:17:03.775 --> 00:17:06.105
We have to send your blood and hair to National Forensic Service.

355
00:17:06.105 --> 00:17:07.145
Is that too much?

356
00:17:07.145 --> 00:17:10.746
But it's my wallet. Please give it back to me.

357
00:17:10.846 --> 00:17:13.415
I can't until I verify your identity.

358
00:17:13.415 --> 00:17:16.355
Aren't you a detective? Can't you tell that I'm him?

359
00:17:16.715 --> 00:17:19.586
So you couldn't get your wallet back?

360
00:17:20.026 --> 00:17:22.395
He said I can't get it without checking my identity.

361
00:17:22.455 --> 00:17:25.026
How can he be a detective when he's not keen?

362
00:17:25.266 --> 00:17:27.665
No makeup can cover up...

363
00:17:27.836 --> 00:17:29.736
my handsome face.

364
00:17:29.736 --> 00:17:30.935
I'm home.

365
00:17:31.165 --> 00:17:33.135
Chewbacca, did you go to Busan?

366
00:17:33.135 --> 00:17:34.635
I told you not to call me...

367
00:17:34.836 --> 00:17:35.905
Goodness.

368
00:17:36.336 --> 00:17:38.776
- Who is this? - Who else would do this?

369
00:17:38.776 --> 00:17:40.976
Is it Jun Ki? What happened to you?

370
00:17:40.976 --> 00:17:42.215
I don't know.

371
00:17:42.215 --> 00:17:44.076
How can you react by hitting first?

372
00:17:44.076 --> 00:17:46.246
I'm sorry. I didn't know that it was you.

373
00:17:46.615 --> 00:17:49.556
If you had known, you would've hit me with the corner.

374
00:17:49.685 --> 00:17:52.425
Thank you for hitting me with the surface.

375
00:17:53.155 --> 00:17:54.496
Let's eat.

376
00:17:54.496 --> 00:17:55.796
Come and eat.

377
00:17:56.925 --> 00:17:59.425
It's mushroom stew. It looks delicious.

378
00:18:01.365 --> 00:18:03.736
Du Shik, I'll take Sol. You should eat.

379
00:18:03.736 --> 00:18:04.766
Aren't you going to eat?

380
00:18:04.766 --> 00:18:06.766
I had some bread, so I'm not hungry.

381
00:18:07.506 --> 00:18:08.806
Go to your mom.

382
00:18:09.905 --> 00:18:11.246
- Here you go. - Gosh.

383
00:18:15.516 --> 00:18:16.516
Goodness.

384
00:18:19.086 --> 00:18:21.355
The soup is delicious.

385
00:18:21.415 --> 00:18:22.715
Don't you think, Dong Gu?

386
00:18:23.056 --> 00:18:24.625
Well, it's not bad.

387
00:18:24.625 --> 00:18:26.125
I'm glad to hear that.

388
00:18:26.226 --> 00:18:28.155
I was worried that you wouldn't like it.

389
00:18:31.266 --> 00:18:32.665
- Jun Ki. - Yes?

390
00:18:32.665 --> 00:18:34.996
- Please try some. - Okay.

391
00:18:40.266 --> 00:18:42.976
- Come on. - Are you an animal?

392
00:18:45.276 --> 00:18:47.816
Yoon Ah, I have a favor to ask.

393
00:18:48.276 --> 00:18:49.276
What is it?

394
00:19:00.526 --> 00:19:01.895
Do you have to eat like that?

395
00:19:01.895 --> 00:19:05.026
I lose my role if I mess up the makeup.

396
00:19:05.026 --> 00:19:06.526
Have some soup too.

397
00:19:09.865 --> 00:19:12.536
It's nice and spicy. It's delicious.

398
00:19:12.536 --> 00:19:13.806
Help yourself.

399
00:19:22.145 --> 00:19:25.185
Hello? Soo Ah, can you meet me just once?

400
00:19:25.185 --> 00:19:27.346
Just give me one minute.

401
00:19:27.816 --> 00:19:30.655
I'll explain everything. We can't break up like this.

402
00:19:30.655 --> 00:19:31.986
Hello?

403
00:19:32.586 --> 00:19:34.395
She hung up again. Let's call again.

404
00:19:36.296 --> 00:19:39.596
Gosh, my stomach hurts. Why is this happening?

405
00:19:46.536 --> 00:19:47.605
What's going on?

406
00:19:47.605 --> 00:19:49.506
- What is everyone doing here? - Don't talk to us.

407
00:19:51.905 --> 00:19:53.675
Chewbacca, come out now.

408
00:19:53.776 --> 00:19:55.076
I'm dying here.

409
00:19:55.076 --> 00:19:56.816
I'm dying too.

410
00:19:56.875 --> 00:19:59.086
At least you can talk, but I...

411
00:20:02.885 --> 00:20:05.425
Does your stomach hurt? Yours too?

412
00:20:05.425 --> 00:20:08.596
My stomach started hurting after lunch.

413
00:20:09.096 --> 00:20:10.256
I can't hold it.

414
00:20:10.256 --> 00:20:11.266
Goodness.

415
00:20:12.096 --> 00:20:13.395
Jun Ki.

416
00:20:14.066 --> 00:20:15.165
What's going on?

417
00:20:15.435 --> 00:20:18.536
What did we eat wrong? What did we eat for lunch?

418
00:20:18.635 --> 00:20:20.435
Mushroom stew, kimchi, and...

419
00:20:21.536 --> 00:20:22.635
Mushroom stew?

420
00:20:23.935 --> 00:20:24.976
No way.

421
00:20:30.175 --> 00:20:31.215
What's wrong?

422
00:20:35.016 --> 00:20:36.155
By any chance,

423
00:20:36.256 --> 00:20:39.326
did you make that stew with this mushroom?

424
00:20:39.685 --> 00:20:41.226
Yes. Why?

425
00:20:41.756 --> 00:20:42.895
What do you mean by why?

426
00:20:42.895 --> 00:20:46.165
I told you to throw this away. It's gone bad!

427
00:20:46.566 --> 00:20:48.695
Pardon? Oh, no! I'm sorry.

428
00:20:48.796 --> 00:20:51.036
I think I couldn't hear what you said because of Sol.

429
00:20:51.036 --> 00:20:52.865
Saying sorry doesn't make anything different.

430
00:20:52.865 --> 00:20:54.306
Everyone's sick now!

431
00:20:56.175 --> 00:20:58.875
Goodness! I'm sorry. I really am!

432
00:20:59.746 --> 00:21:00.875
Alright.

433
00:21:01.746 --> 00:21:05.516
I had enough of this. Just pack your stuff, and leave right now.

434
00:21:08.516 --> 00:21:10.885
Dong Gu!

435
00:21:27.165 --> 00:21:30.506
Until the East sea dries

436
00:21:31.306 --> 00:21:32.705
And Mount Baekdu

437
00:21:35.076 --> 00:21:37.415
Wears

438
00:21:39.086 --> 00:21:42.615
The Almighty will help us

439
00:21:46.026 --> 00:21:47.855
There it is!

440
00:21:50.996 --> 00:21:53.296
(Out of order)

441
00:22:01.776 --> 00:22:03.635
What are you doing now?

442
00:22:03.736 --> 00:22:05.346
I'm really sorry.

443
00:22:07.205 --> 00:22:08.375
Soo Ah.

444
00:22:09.215 --> 00:22:11.145
Wait, wait!

445
00:22:11.145 --> 00:22:13.145
- Please, I need to talk to you. - I have nothing talk to you.

446
00:22:13.145 --> 00:22:16.215
Wait! Please, just give me one minute.

447
00:22:17.385 --> 00:22:19.756
Right. I'll give you a minute. What do you want to tell me?

448
00:22:20.425 --> 00:22:21.526
I mean...

449
00:22:24.695 --> 00:22:26.425
Soo Ah, I...

450
00:22:27.796 --> 00:22:29.165
I'm really sorry but...

451
00:22:29.395 --> 00:22:32.605
- Could you please wait here? - Why would I do that?

452
00:22:32.605 --> 00:22:34.536
I'll say it now then!

453
00:22:34.935 --> 00:22:37.846
- Why is this happening now? - What?

454
00:22:38.145 --> 00:22:39.976
No, don't get me wrong. I'll tell you now.

455
00:22:42.175 --> 00:22:45.046
Soo Ah, it's all my fault.

456
00:22:45.415 --> 00:22:47.185
- I'm so sorry. - What are you sorry for?

457
00:22:48.256 --> 00:22:50.256
- For everything. - What is everything?

458
00:22:50.355 --> 00:22:51.455
Be specific.

459
00:22:51.455 --> 00:22:52.556
Be specific?

460
00:22:53.925 --> 00:22:55.026
So...

461
00:23:01.195 --> 00:23:03.965
I tried to sell our couple rings.

462
00:23:03.965 --> 00:23:05.036
And?

463
00:23:05.605 --> 00:23:06.766
I'm irresponsible.

464
00:23:06.766 --> 00:23:08.576
- And? - Is there more?

465
00:23:09.205 --> 00:23:11.776
You are right. It's...

466
00:23:12.145 --> 00:23:13.246
What was that?

467
00:23:20.715 --> 00:23:22.915
Did you just fart...

468
00:23:23.385 --> 00:23:24.526
in this situation?

469
00:23:24.526 --> 00:23:27.425
No, I didn't. It was this noise.

470
00:23:27.695 --> 00:23:29.625
You even joke in this kind of situation.

471
00:23:29.955 --> 00:23:31.096
Right. This is it.

472
00:23:31.096 --> 00:23:33.566
Wait, Soo Ah! It's not what you think!

473
00:23:41.875 --> 00:23:43.236
You are not even stopping me anymore.

474
00:23:43.405 --> 00:23:45.506
- I would love to do that, but... - Fine.

475
00:23:45.645 --> 00:23:47.875
We are really done. Got it?

476
00:23:47.945 --> 00:23:50.175
Please wait, Soo Ah.

477
00:23:55.986 --> 00:23:58.385
I'm really sorry, Soo Ah.

478
00:24:13.705 --> 00:24:15.175
Bath... Bathroom.

479
00:24:15.506 --> 00:24:17.036
It's a bathroom.

480
00:24:27.885 --> 00:24:31.486
(Public toilets for sales)

481
00:24:31.486 --> 00:24:33.486
You can look around first.

482
00:24:33.786 --> 00:24:35.925
This kind of portable toilets are...

483
00:24:36.125 --> 00:24:37.826
quite popular these days.

484
00:24:37.826 --> 00:24:39.165
- Would you like to look at it? - Okay.

485
00:24:40.165 --> 00:24:41.695
Why is it locked?

486
00:24:42.236 --> 00:24:45.006
- What's going on? - It's occupied.

487
00:24:45.236 --> 00:24:47.135
Who is this?

488
00:24:48.576 --> 00:24:50.105
Do I have to tell you that?

489
00:24:50.105 --> 00:24:51.476
What are you doing there?

490
00:24:51.476 --> 00:24:53.806
Please wait, I'm almost done.

491
00:24:54.105 --> 00:24:55.776
Almost done? Done with what?

492
00:24:55.776 --> 00:24:57.046
What a weird man.

493
00:24:57.215 --> 00:24:59.715
It's a toilet. Of course, I'm pooping. Should I cook here?

494
00:24:59.715 --> 00:25:00.986
What did you say?

495
00:25:00.986 --> 00:25:03.786
What are you talking about? Get out!

496
00:25:04.155 --> 00:25:06.756
- Get out of there right now! - What is he doing?

497
00:25:06.855 --> 00:25:09.726
- Get out right now! - I'll see you out there.

498
00:25:09.925 --> 00:25:13.965
What are you doing here? This is my business property.

499
00:25:14.395 --> 00:25:15.596
I'm sorry.

500
00:25:15.596 --> 00:25:18.665
I thought this was a public toilet. I was really in a hurry.

501
00:25:18.665 --> 00:25:22.236
I don't care if you were in a hurry or not. This is a new product.

502
00:25:22.236 --> 00:25:24.276
How could you poop there?

503
00:25:24.405 --> 00:25:26.046
What should I do with this now?

504
00:25:26.405 --> 00:25:27.675
What a mess!

505
00:25:27.915 --> 00:25:29.675
Who's going to buy this?

506
00:25:29.675 --> 00:25:32.346
I'm really sorry. I'll take care of it.

507
00:25:32.546 --> 00:25:33.615
Dong Gu?

508
00:25:35.955 --> 00:25:38.826
Yoon Ah? Why are you here?

509
00:25:38.885 --> 00:25:41.526
You all got food poisoning from me, so I went to get some medicine.

510
00:25:42.496 --> 00:25:45.826
Dong Gu, did you really poop there by chance?

511
00:25:47.195 --> 00:25:49.435
- That's... - It's such a mess.

512
00:25:49.536 --> 00:25:51.135
He pooped so much in there.

513
00:26:04.645 --> 00:26:05.746
Dong Gu.

514
00:26:06.645 --> 00:26:07.955
Isn't that too much?

515
00:26:10.516 --> 00:26:13.986
I know, right? Why would you buy that when we have a normal bathroom?

516
00:26:13.986 --> 00:26:16.925
Well, after going through what happened today,

517
00:26:17.096 --> 00:26:18.895
I realized that we don't have enough toilets.

518
00:26:18.996 --> 00:26:22.596
We could have installed some more toilet. Why do we need that?

519
00:26:31.105 --> 00:26:32.246
Goodness!

520
00:26:38.385 --> 00:26:39.586
I'm so sorry.

521
00:26:39.915 --> 00:26:41.615
You should've been more careful.

522
00:26:41.955 --> 00:26:44.086
That's Dong Gu's only award.

523
00:26:47.385 --> 00:26:48.556
I'm sorry.

524
00:26:49.726 --> 00:26:52.566
It's okay. It's not like you did that intentionally, Yoon Ah.

525
00:26:52.796 --> 00:26:55.195
People do make mistakes.

526
00:26:56.195 --> 00:26:57.965
- Don't worry about it. - What's going on?

527
00:26:57.965 --> 00:26:59.635
You told her to pack and leave earlier.

528
00:26:59.635 --> 00:27:01.105
That was like a shock tactic.

529
00:27:01.375 --> 00:27:03.435
I'm kind of supporting her to do a better job in the future.

530
00:27:04.776 --> 00:27:08.175
Yoon Ah, forget about what happened so far.

531
00:27:09.215 --> 00:27:10.375
Let's get along.

532
00:27:10.715 --> 00:27:12.346
- What? - Okay?

533
00:27:13.185 --> 00:27:14.615
Okay.

534
00:27:18.625 --> 00:27:22.026
There's one condition though. Took the secret to the grave.

535
00:27:23.425 --> 00:27:24.726
Don't worry about that.

536
00:27:27.066 --> 00:27:28.165
Thank you.

537
00:27:35.736 --> 00:27:37.006
Hello.

538
00:27:40.645 --> 00:27:41.776
Hi.

539
00:27:43.276 --> 00:27:44.415
Goodness.

540
00:27:51.625 --> 00:27:54.556
It's fine. I'll pick it up later. Go have a seat.

541
00:27:55.355 --> 00:27:56.596
I'm sorry.

542
00:28:00.695 --> 00:28:02.395
I'm sorry.

543
00:28:04.635 --> 00:28:06.736
What am I doing now?

544
00:28:08.205 --> 00:28:11.006
This is so annoying. I'm going to succeed and get a main role soon.

545
00:28:17.415 --> 00:28:18.786
A mutant?

546
00:28:56.155 --> 00:28:57.415
My stomach...

547
00:29:11.036 --> 00:29:12.205
Seo Jin!

548
00:29:12.905 --> 00:29:14.105
Yoon Ah.

549
00:29:18.246 --> 00:29:22.875
(You know what? It's a secret.)

550
00:29:34.925 --> 00:29:36.125
Why did you do that?

551
00:29:36.125 --> 00:29:39.365
It just looked fun for my dad and my brother, so I copied them.

552
00:29:40.395 --> 00:29:43.135
But my hair got thicker since then.

553
00:29:45.766 --> 00:29:48.605
What's so bad about it? You just need to shave sometimes.

554
00:29:48.605 --> 00:29:49.776
It's not just sometimes.

555
00:29:50.736 --> 00:29:52.776
If I don't shave for about half a day,

556
00:29:53.746 --> 00:29:55.115
I look like a caveman.

557
00:29:55.915 --> 00:29:57.846
How stupid is that?

558
00:29:58.086 --> 00:30:00.715
Among all the things you could imitate, why did you do that?

559
00:30:00.715 --> 00:30:03.056
I didn't know this would happen to me.

560
00:30:03.155 --> 00:30:04.756
Is that why she's called Chewbacca?

561
00:30:04.986 --> 00:30:07.056
Chewbacca isn't the only one.

562
00:30:07.155 --> 00:30:10.326
Bayaba, Zhang Fei, Im Kkeok Jeong, and Jang Seung Eop...

563
00:30:10.526 --> 00:30:12.796
- Everyone that's hairy is... - Stop it!

564
00:30:13.425 --> 00:30:14.996
It's okay.

565
00:30:14.996 --> 00:30:17.365
It's not your fault to have some facial hair. Don't worry.

566
00:30:17.465 --> 00:30:18.635
Thank you.

567
00:30:21.105 --> 00:30:23.306
Hello, Yoo Jin. What's up?

568
00:30:23.875 --> 00:30:25.905
What? Tae Hyun is coming!

569
00:30:26.405 --> 00:30:28.276
I see. I'll be there soon.

570
00:30:28.675 --> 00:30:32.016
Isn't he the one you've been in love with since your freshman year?

571
00:30:32.016 --> 00:30:34.115
- That's not it. - What do you mean?

572
00:30:34.215 --> 00:30:35.915
You're a lucky girl.

573
00:30:35.915 --> 00:30:36.986
You even have time to date.

574
00:30:36.986 --> 00:30:38.425
I can take care of myself.

575
00:30:38.425 --> 00:30:40.526
Mind your own business, will you?

576
00:30:40.526 --> 00:30:41.556
Fine.

577
00:30:41.556 --> 00:30:42.655
I should get ready.

578
00:30:43.195 --> 00:30:45.766
Look at you. Are you that happy?

579
00:30:45.865 --> 00:30:48.695
But she hasn't been able to tell him about her feelings.

580
00:30:48.736 --> 00:30:51.566
If you think about it, she's bad at dating.

581
00:30:52.236 --> 00:30:54.935
Can you really say that when you've never had a girlfriend?

582
00:30:55.976 --> 00:30:58.405
- Yoon Ah. - There he goes again.

583
00:30:58.405 --> 00:31:01.316
We ran out of bread and eggs in the kitchen. What happened?

584
00:31:01.316 --> 00:31:02.375
Oh, my.

585
00:31:02.445 --> 00:31:04.175
I forgot to stock up. I'm sorry.

586
00:31:04.175 --> 00:31:06.145
You're not supposed to forget it.

587
00:31:06.145 --> 00:31:07.955
Didn't I tell you to purchase them in advance...

588
00:31:07.955 --> 00:31:09.615
for our guests' breakfast?

589
00:31:09.615 --> 00:31:11.425
I'm sorry. I'll go and pick them up right away.

590
00:31:11.425 --> 00:31:12.625
Hurry.

591
00:31:13.625 --> 00:31:16.425
Gosh, she never does anything right.

592
00:31:16.425 --> 00:31:17.965
Give her a break.

593
00:31:17.965 --> 00:31:19.395
She's doing her best.

594
00:31:19.395 --> 00:31:20.496
Cut it out.

595
00:31:20.496 --> 00:31:22.536
I'm sure she'll make...

596
00:31:22.536 --> 00:31:24.066
a huge mistake soon.

597
00:31:24.066 --> 00:31:26.105
She'll get better.

598
00:31:26.105 --> 00:31:27.875
Give her some time.

599
00:31:29.635 --> 00:31:30.675
Why are you back?

600
00:31:30.836 --> 00:31:33.405
I forgot the cart. See you.

601
00:31:34.976 --> 00:31:36.375
See?

602
00:31:36.375 --> 00:31:37.786
How can I trust her?

603
00:31:37.786 --> 00:31:39.415
It's no big deal.

604
00:31:41.316 --> 00:31:43.355
- What is it now? - I forgot my wallet.

605
00:31:45.655 --> 00:31:47.125
- See you. - See you.

606
00:31:47.326 --> 00:31:48.625
My goodness.

607
00:31:52.296 --> 00:31:54.766
Gosh. What is it?

608
00:31:54.766 --> 00:31:56.665
Where's the supermarket?

609
00:32:01.689 --> 00:32:06.689
<font color="#fcc89b">[VIU Ver] jTBC E02 Eulachacha Waikiki "She's My Girlfriend"</font>
<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

610
00:32:11.615 --> 00:32:15.115
We came here many times, how can you still not know the route?

611
00:32:15.915 --> 00:32:16.986
I'm sorry.

612
00:32:17.185 --> 00:32:18.885
I'm bad with directions.

613
00:32:19.326 --> 00:32:21.056
But I think I know now.

614
00:32:21.056 --> 00:32:22.056
Well...

615
00:32:22.296 --> 00:32:25.266
You sound so confident you're making me worried.

616
00:32:25.766 --> 00:32:27.736
I'm tired of nagging.

617
00:32:27.736 --> 00:32:29.935
Do things on your own from now on, okay?

618
00:32:30.066 --> 00:32:32.405
Do you understand? Do you?

619
00:32:36.476 --> 00:32:37.846
What are you doing there?

620
00:32:38.105 --> 00:32:40.046
These toys are on sale.

621
00:32:40.306 --> 00:32:43.316
I haven't bought any toys for Sol yet.

622
00:32:43.645 --> 00:32:46.885
But even the discounted prices are quite high.

623
00:32:48.115 --> 00:32:49.516
- Let's just go. - Well...

624
00:32:49.885 --> 00:32:51.385
Pick one.

625
00:32:51.756 --> 00:32:52.826
Are you sure?

626
00:32:53.056 --> 00:32:54.526
Just one.

627
00:32:54.955 --> 00:32:57.965
Thank you. Thank you so much.

628
00:33:00.496 --> 00:33:02.596
Is she shameless or innocent?

629
00:33:07.135 --> 00:33:09.506
- I'm sorry. - No problem.

630
00:33:09.635 --> 00:33:10.635
Soo Ah.

631
00:33:11.675 --> 00:33:14.076
Who is he? Do you know him?

632
00:33:14.076 --> 00:33:16.175
Well, he's a friend.

633
00:33:17.615 --> 00:33:20.115
A friend? Soo Ah.

634
00:33:20.746 --> 00:33:23.516
Who is this guy? Who is he?

635
00:33:24.955 --> 00:33:25.955
Hi.

636
00:33:25.955 --> 00:33:28.796
I'm Soo Ah's boyfriend, Lee Yoon Seok.

637
00:33:28.796 --> 00:33:30.155
Boyfriend?

638
00:33:32.326 --> 00:33:35.195
I run a Thai restaurant near here.

639
00:33:35.266 --> 00:33:37.266
If you come by, I'll treat you to a meal.

640
00:33:37.266 --> 00:33:38.365
Me?

641
00:33:38.766 --> 00:33:40.736
Dong Gu, I picked one.

642
00:33:40.736 --> 00:33:41.935
I want this.

643
00:33:42.276 --> 00:33:43.375
Who is she?

644
00:33:44.675 --> 00:33:45.746
What?

645
00:33:48.846 --> 00:33:50.145
She's my girlfriend.

646
00:33:50.746 --> 00:33:52.016
Your girlfriend?

647
00:33:52.246 --> 00:33:53.746
Are you seeing someone already?

648
00:33:53.746 --> 00:33:55.756
You can date, but I can't?

649
00:33:57.016 --> 00:33:58.486
I didn't say that.

650
00:33:59.125 --> 00:34:01.296
What does she do?

651
00:34:01.296 --> 00:34:02.296
What?

652
00:34:03.326 --> 00:34:04.695
(Doctor's Bag)

653
00:34:05.496 --> 00:34:07.865
She's a doctor. A neurosurgeon.

654
00:34:08.665 --> 00:34:11.235
That's why she picks a toy like this.

655
00:34:13.206 --> 00:34:14.505
What's going on?

656
00:34:14.835 --> 00:34:17.436
All you care about is work.

657
00:34:17.606 --> 00:34:19.606
Dong Gu, what are you doing?

658
00:34:19.606 --> 00:34:20.746
Look at you.

659
00:34:20.945 --> 00:34:22.246
Soo Ah.

660
00:34:22.315 --> 00:34:23.815
Now that we've met,

661
00:34:23.815 --> 00:34:25.686
why don't we grab a cup of coffee together?

662
00:34:26.045 --> 00:34:28.686
We don't need to. We're not that close.

663
00:34:28.856 --> 00:34:30.485
It doesn't matter.

664
00:34:30.485 --> 00:34:31.856
When you're done,

665
00:34:31.856 --> 00:34:34.195
why don't you come to my restaurant for dinner?

666
00:34:34.195 --> 00:34:37.056
Well, Dr. Han is quite busy.

667
00:34:37.056 --> 00:34:38.565
I'm not sure she'll have time.

668
00:34:38.565 --> 00:34:40.465
But we'll try to come.

669
00:34:40.465 --> 00:34:41.666
Let's go, Yoon Ah.

670
00:34:42.766 --> 00:34:44.166
Excuse me.

671
00:34:48.036 --> 00:34:50.036
Dong Gu, what's going on?

672
00:34:50.036 --> 00:34:51.976
- Keep your voice down. - Okay.

673
00:34:52.405 --> 00:34:54.576
So she's Soo Ah? She's beautiful.

674
00:34:54.576 --> 00:34:57.545
- Please keep your voice down. - Okay.

675
00:34:58.445 --> 00:35:00.016
By the way, are you really buying me this toy?

676
00:35:00.016 --> 00:35:01.615
Yes, I will.

677
00:35:01.615 --> 00:35:03.956
So please be quiet.

678
00:35:08.755 --> 00:35:12.025
What? Soo Ah already has a new boyfriend?

679
00:35:13.425 --> 00:35:14.496
What does he do?

680
00:35:14.496 --> 00:35:16.965
He runs a Thai restaurant or something.

681
00:35:18.166 --> 00:35:21.476
He invited me to his restaurant. How arrogant.

682
00:35:22.306 --> 00:35:25.005
Why did you have to lie that Yoon Ah is your girlfriend?

683
00:35:25.106 --> 00:35:26.806
And she's a doctor?

684
00:35:26.905 --> 00:35:29.476
I lost my temper when I saw Soo Ah...

685
00:35:29.476 --> 00:35:30.476
with that guy.

686
00:35:30.476 --> 00:35:34.456
Gosh. I guess it's really over between you and Soo Ah now.

687
00:35:35.186 --> 00:35:36.755
No, it's not.

688
00:35:36.985 --> 00:35:39.826
This might be your chance. Your last chance.

689
00:35:40.126 --> 00:35:41.525
What do you mean?

690
00:35:41.525 --> 00:35:42.856
Let me tell you.

691
00:35:42.856 --> 00:35:45.565
You'll hear from Soo Ah soon.

692
00:35:46.525 --> 00:35:47.695
No way.

693
00:35:49.635 --> 00:35:51.606
Wait. You were right.

694
00:35:52.065 --> 00:35:54.376
See? What did I tell you?

695
00:35:54.576 --> 00:35:56.235
Try reading her text out loud.

696
00:35:57.706 --> 00:36:00.146
"It was nice to see you. Your girlfriend is pretty."

697
00:36:00.175 --> 00:36:02.315
No, that's not it.

698
00:36:02.516 --> 00:36:04.945
"It was nice to see you. Your girlfriend is pretty."

699
00:36:05.286 --> 00:36:06.815
That's more like it.

700
00:36:06.815 --> 00:36:08.585
Do, re, mi, fa, sol. It's sol.

701
00:36:08.585 --> 00:36:11.056
You should sound really irritated.

702
00:36:11.056 --> 00:36:12.456
No way.

703
00:36:13.226 --> 00:36:14.925
What do you guys know?

704
00:36:15.655 --> 00:36:17.056
- Dong Gu. - Yes?

705
00:36:17.056 --> 00:36:18.096
Yes, you.

706
00:36:18.096 --> 00:36:21.536
You're incompetent and immature and have no future.

707
00:36:21.536 --> 00:36:22.795
So she dumped you.

708
00:36:23.036 --> 00:36:25.306
But now she found out that you're going out with...

709
00:36:25.306 --> 00:36:27.806
a feminine-looking doctor.

710
00:36:28.335 --> 00:36:29.376
How would she feel?

711
00:36:29.476 --> 00:36:32.246
- "Poor girl." - No. That's wrong.

712
00:36:32.505 --> 00:36:34.545
Soo Ah must be so confused.

713
00:36:34.545 --> 00:36:36.476
She's thinking so much.

714
00:36:36.476 --> 00:36:38.445
"Why?"

715
00:36:38.585 --> 00:36:40.115
"Why would that girl go out with Dong Gu?"

716
00:36:40.246 --> 00:36:42.315
"Is Dong Gu a nice guy after all?"

717
00:36:42.315 --> 00:36:45.155
"Does he have a charm that I don't know about?"

718
00:36:45.155 --> 00:36:48.826
She must be going crazy. Completely crazy.

719
00:36:48.826 --> 00:36:51.365
It makes sense. And?

720
00:36:51.565 --> 00:36:54.235
So if you use this opportunity smartly,

721
00:36:54.235 --> 00:36:57.396
you might be able to get back together with Soo Ah.

722
00:36:57.396 --> 00:37:00.565
Really? What should I do?

723
00:37:00.565 --> 00:37:01.775
What do you think?

724
00:37:02.036 --> 00:37:03.735
You said her boyfriend invited you to his restaurant.

725
00:37:04.275 --> 00:37:07.675
You should go. Take Yoon Ah with you too.

726
00:37:08.346 --> 00:37:09.416
And?

727
00:37:09.516 --> 00:37:12.385
Show Soo Ah what an amazing guy you are.

728
00:37:12.385 --> 00:37:14.085
Make her regret dumping you.

729
00:37:14.186 --> 00:37:16.286
- How? - It all depends on...

730
00:37:17.525 --> 00:37:19.385
Dr. Han.

731
00:37:20.786 --> 00:37:22.996
What? What am I supposed to do?

732
00:37:22.996 --> 00:37:26.295
Yoon Ah, please help me. I beg you.

733
00:37:26.295 --> 00:37:28.735
I'd love to help you, but I don't think I can do this.

734
00:37:28.735 --> 00:37:30.096
Are you serious?

735
00:37:30.536 --> 00:37:33.706
If you help me this time, I'll forget about all your mistakes.

736
00:37:33.706 --> 00:37:36.135
Please help me, will you?

737
00:37:38.005 --> 00:37:39.306
Fine.

738
00:37:39.306 --> 00:37:41.016
Thank you, Yoon Ah.

739
00:37:41.016 --> 00:37:43.016
What are we supposed to do now?

740
00:37:43.016 --> 00:37:46.146
Dr. Han should doll up first.

741
00:37:46.516 --> 00:37:49.456
You should look elegant and gorgeous.

742
00:38:01.682 --> 00:38:02.881
Gosh, my bag.

743
00:38:06.182 --> 00:38:07.542
What are you doing here?

744
00:38:07.542 --> 00:38:09.211
Well...

745
00:38:09.412 --> 00:38:13.151
I had to go to the career center, and I thought I'd stop by here.

746
00:38:14.151 --> 00:38:17.622
By the way, when will Tae Hyun be here?

747
00:38:17.622 --> 00:38:19.022
You're here to see him, aren't you?

748
00:38:19.022 --> 00:38:21.022
No. I wanted to see you guys.

749
00:38:21.022 --> 00:38:22.361
Cut it out.

750
00:38:22.361 --> 00:38:24.191
He just called and said...

751
00:38:24.191 --> 00:38:26.131
that he's running late because of an interview.

752
00:38:26.131 --> 00:38:28.031
I have to go now.

753
00:38:28.062 --> 00:38:31.272
Okay. I'll be going soon too.

754
00:38:31.272 --> 00:38:32.472
I swear.

755
00:38:48.281 --> 00:38:50.722
You look pretty good when you're dressed up.

756
00:38:50.722 --> 00:38:52.961
You usually look so shabby.

757
00:38:53.421 --> 00:38:54.992
I don't normally dress up,

758
00:38:54.992 --> 00:38:57.492
but when I do, I look as good as Gong Yoo.

759
00:38:57.492 --> 00:38:59.261
Gong Yoo, my foot.

760
00:38:59.261 --> 00:39:00.401
You don't look that good.

761
00:39:00.531 --> 00:39:01.731
Can I really trust you?

762
00:39:01.731 --> 00:39:04.731
If you do as I say, everything will work out.

763
00:39:04.731 --> 00:39:07.002
When I listen to you, things usually go wrong.

764
00:39:07.142 --> 00:39:08.602
I'm not sure if it'll really be okay.

765
00:39:08.602 --> 00:39:10.071
Trust me.

766
00:39:10.071 --> 00:39:13.341
Your biggest weakness is that you don't trust people.

767
00:39:13.341 --> 00:39:15.781
Be quiet. What's taking Yoon Ah so long?

768
00:39:40.102 --> 00:39:41.142
What do you think?

769
00:39:41.671 --> 00:39:44.171
It feels awkward to wear makeup after such a long time.

770
00:39:44.511 --> 00:39:45.642
It looks weird, right?

771
00:39:47.142 --> 00:39:48.182
No.

772
00:39:48.812 --> 00:39:50.781
You look pretty. You look very pretty.

773
00:39:51.252 --> 00:39:52.352
Right, Jun Ki?

774
00:39:53.252 --> 00:39:54.381
You're right.

775
00:39:54.981 --> 00:39:57.151
You look completely different with the makeup.

776
00:39:58.151 --> 00:39:59.522
Don't you think, Dong Gu?

777
00:40:00.392 --> 00:40:01.492
Yes.

778
00:40:02.062 --> 00:40:03.832
She doesn't look bad.

779
00:40:04.091 --> 00:40:06.301
- It's time to go. - Okay.

780
00:40:07.162 --> 00:40:09.602
Is it okay to leave Sol with you?

781
00:40:09.932 --> 00:40:11.102
Don't worry about it.

782
00:40:11.102 --> 00:40:12.502
We'll take good care of Sol.

783
00:40:12.502 --> 00:40:14.941
Okay, I'll be back.

784
00:40:16.742 --> 00:40:18.772
Come back successful, Dong Gu.

785
00:40:19.582 --> 00:40:20.781
Let's cheer for your mom.

786
00:40:20.781 --> 00:40:22.981
- You can do it, Mom. - You can do it.

787
00:40:24.452 --> 00:40:26.182
That's a loud way to cheer.

788
00:40:26.481 --> 00:40:27.622
She's a good daughter.

789
00:40:27.622 --> 00:40:29.252
Can you hold her?

790
00:40:29.252 --> 00:40:30.921
I'm going to cheer too.

791
00:40:30.921 --> 00:40:32.722
Why would you cheer now? Jun Ki.

792
00:40:34.022 --> 00:40:36.662
(Hankook University Newspaper)

793
00:40:44.332 --> 00:40:46.171
Why is it so empty here?

794
00:40:50.312 --> 00:40:51.372
Seo Jin.

795
00:40:52.171 --> 00:40:55.011
- Kang Seo Jin. - Yes?

796
00:40:57.511 --> 00:40:59.222
Tae Hyun.

797
00:40:59.452 --> 00:41:00.651
I haven't seen you in a while.

798
00:41:02.022 --> 00:41:04.292
Yes, it's been a while.

799
00:41:04.292 --> 00:41:07.691
I finished work so late. I was worried that no one would be here.

800
00:41:08.162 --> 00:41:10.231
I'm happy that you waited for me.

801
00:41:10.231 --> 00:41:13.801
I wasn't waiting for you. I didn't know that you were coming.

802
00:41:13.801 --> 00:41:16.372
- I'm serious. - I heard you.

803
00:41:16.372 --> 00:41:17.731
There's no need to fuss.

804
00:41:18.002 --> 00:41:21.702
Do you want to see the renovated archive room?

805
00:41:31.981 --> 00:41:33.921
It became so clean.

806
00:41:34.522 --> 00:41:37.522
There used to be spider webs and mice.

807
00:41:38.151 --> 00:41:39.792
It looked haunted.

808
00:41:42.631 --> 00:41:45.062
- Is this still here? - What is it?

809
00:41:45.131 --> 00:41:46.202
It's this.

810
00:41:46.702 --> 00:41:50.231
It's the first article that you wrote.

811
00:41:52.272 --> 00:41:53.972
How is your job search going?

812
00:41:54.702 --> 00:41:56.772
I'm trying hard.

813
00:41:56.772 --> 00:41:58.312
Come to our newspaper.

814
00:41:58.312 --> 00:41:59.542
It'd be fun to work together.

815
00:41:59.542 --> 00:42:01.182
I already applied there,

816
00:42:01.981 --> 00:42:03.051
but I didn't get in.

817
00:42:03.151 --> 00:42:05.011
It's okay.

818
00:42:05.011 --> 00:42:07.051
I was rejected twice before getting hired.

819
00:42:07.352 --> 00:42:09.821
You'll get it next time. Don't lose hope.

820
00:42:25.002 --> 00:42:26.642
I'm hungry. Do you want to eat?

821
00:42:26.642 --> 00:42:27.742
Really?

822
00:42:29.171 --> 00:42:30.642
We should eat something delicious.

823
00:42:32.711 --> 00:42:34.841
- What's going on? - Why won't it open?

824
00:42:37.182 --> 00:42:38.252
Oh, no.

825
00:42:39.421 --> 00:42:40.682
Why won't it open?

826
00:42:40.921 --> 00:42:42.352
Give me your phone, Seo Jin.

827
00:42:44.252 --> 00:42:45.961
I left it on the desk.

828
00:42:46.662 --> 00:42:48.122
I left mine in my bag.

829
00:42:48.122 --> 00:42:49.662
Gosh, what should we do?

830
00:42:49.761 --> 00:42:50.892
We're in trouble.

831
00:42:58.932 --> 00:43:01.272
Yoon Ah, let's review one last time.

832
00:43:01.401 --> 00:43:04.111
- What's your occupation? - The best neurosurgeon in Korea.

833
00:43:04.111 --> 00:43:06.682
- Your parents? - Hospital director and painter.

834
00:43:06.682 --> 00:43:07.912
Where did we meet?

835
00:43:07.912 --> 00:43:10.011
Third table in the hospital cafeteria.

836
00:43:10.051 --> 00:43:12.011
- Okay, are you ready? - Yes.

837
00:43:12.151 --> 00:43:13.352
I'll do my best.

838
00:43:14.082 --> 00:43:15.852
Okay, let's go in.

839
00:43:30.472 --> 00:43:33.002
I didn't expect you to show up. I'm surprised.

840
00:43:33.002 --> 00:43:37.472
Luckily Yoon Ah got off work early, so we stopped by.

841
00:43:39.441 --> 00:43:41.711
I thought it was a fancy restaurant,

842
00:43:42.611 --> 00:43:43.711
but it's simple.

843
00:43:44.051 --> 00:43:45.182
Really?

844
00:43:45.481 --> 00:43:47.551
But I guarantee that the food is delicious.

845
00:43:48.151 --> 00:43:50.051
Let's order first. What would you like?

846
00:43:50.622 --> 00:43:51.792
Choose for us.

847
00:43:54.091 --> 00:43:56.892
We'd like to order, please.

848
00:43:57.332 --> 00:43:58.461
We'd like...

849
00:44:05.901 --> 00:44:07.841
One of each and...

850
00:44:12.312 --> 00:44:14.182
- That'd be all. - Okay, sir.

851
00:44:15.682 --> 00:44:18.511
Dish names are similar to Muay Thai players.

852
00:44:18.812 --> 00:44:20.582
They sound aggressive.

853
00:44:21.752 --> 00:44:23.091
What kind of alcohol would you like to drink?

854
00:44:23.091 --> 00:44:25.421
No thank you. I'm breastfeeding...

855
00:44:25.861 --> 00:44:27.821
Pardon? Breastfeeding?

856
00:44:29.792 --> 00:44:31.531
That's not what I meant.

857
00:44:31.531 --> 00:44:35.002
It's not breastfeeding. She meant surgery.

858
00:44:35.002 --> 00:44:37.372
She has an important surgery tomorrow morning.

859
00:44:38.131 --> 00:44:39.341
Surgery?

860
00:44:41.841 --> 00:44:43.071
What type of surgery?

861
00:44:43.071 --> 00:44:45.711
Pardon me? It's...

862
00:44:46.341 --> 00:44:47.742
It's related to...

863
00:44:48.412 --> 00:44:50.511
the small intestine.

864
00:44:50.781 --> 00:44:51.881
Pardon?

865
00:44:52.981 --> 00:44:55.622
You operate on the small intestine as a neurosurgeon?

866
00:44:56.292 --> 00:44:58.492
What I mean is...

867
00:45:00.421 --> 00:45:03.191
She specializes in neurosurgery,

868
00:45:03.392 --> 00:45:05.392
but she works in multiple departments.

869
00:45:05.392 --> 00:45:08.731
She's licensed in internal medicine, general surgery, and OBGYN.

870
00:45:10.202 --> 00:45:12.332
Why would she fall for someone like you?

871
00:45:15.742 --> 00:45:19.981
Others may think that Dong Gu has nothing to offer,

872
00:45:20.441 --> 00:45:22.142
but they're wrong.

873
00:45:22.341 --> 00:45:23.952
However, I saw...

874
00:45:24.051 --> 00:45:26.182
Dong Gu's bright future.

875
00:45:28.452 --> 00:45:30.022
No way.

876
00:45:30.022 --> 00:45:31.992
Yes, I'm sure of it.

877
00:45:32.122 --> 00:45:35.832
You'll definitely be the best film director in the world.

878
00:45:36.662 --> 00:45:38.961
My predictions are never wrong,

879
00:45:39.801 --> 00:45:40.961
so you can trust me.

880
00:45:43.772 --> 00:45:45.071
I can't stop her.

881
00:45:46.242 --> 00:45:47.502
However,

882
00:45:48.901 --> 00:45:50.812
he hasn't opened up to me yet.

883
00:45:51.711 --> 00:45:52.941
It's hard for me.

884
00:45:54.182 --> 00:45:55.682
I already told you.

885
00:45:56.151 --> 00:45:58.252
my heart hasn't recovered yet.

886
00:45:58.611 --> 00:46:01.752
It's okay. There's nothing...

887
00:46:02.352 --> 00:46:04.091
I ask of you.

888
00:46:06.892 --> 00:46:07.992
I'm sorry.

889
00:46:08.691 --> 00:46:10.131
I don't deserve you.

890
00:46:19.872 --> 00:46:21.341
We're locked in.

891
00:46:22.511 --> 00:46:25.111
We can only leave when people come in the morning.

892
00:46:25.812 --> 00:46:28.182
However, being here with you...

893
00:46:30.312 --> 00:46:31.481
isn't bad.

894
00:46:33.222 --> 00:46:34.781
What do you mean?

895
00:46:35.682 --> 00:46:39.662
Seo Jin, I have something to...

896
00:46:40.761 --> 00:46:42.091
tell you.

897
00:46:42.162 --> 00:46:43.292
What is it?

898
00:46:47.662 --> 00:46:49.702
For a long time,

899
00:46:53.171 --> 00:46:54.272
I...

900
00:46:57.341 --> 00:46:59.711
What is it?

901
00:47:00.742 --> 00:47:01.881
You have...

902
00:47:02.852 --> 00:47:04.611
something under the nose.

903
00:47:04.611 --> 00:47:07.421
- Is there something under my nose? - Yes.

904
00:47:07.981 --> 00:47:09.122
One second.

905
00:47:14.392 --> 00:47:17.492
Gosh, my mustache is growing again.

906
00:47:17.591 --> 00:47:19.361
My razor is in my bag.

907
00:47:21.102 --> 00:47:22.502
What's wrong?

908
00:47:25.272 --> 00:47:26.602
It's nothing.

909
00:47:27.002 --> 00:47:29.242
- It's some dust. - Is that so?

910
00:47:30.111 --> 00:47:32.682
What I wanted to tell you is...

911
00:47:32.981 --> 00:47:34.542
Don't come near me.

912
00:47:34.542 --> 00:47:37.352
- What's wrong? - Don't come near me.

913
00:47:38.952 --> 00:47:40.122
I must get out.

914
00:47:40.381 --> 00:47:42.651
Everything is over if he finds out.

915
00:47:45.651 --> 00:47:48.361
Hello? We're locked in here.

916
00:47:48.361 --> 00:47:51.691
- Please help us. - Hey.

917
00:47:51.892 --> 00:47:55.062
- What's wrong, Seo Jin? - Don't come near me.

918
00:47:56.671 --> 00:47:59.671
Hello? Can anyone hear me?

919
00:47:59.671 --> 00:48:01.372
We're locked in.

920
00:48:01.372 --> 00:48:03.441
- Come back to senses. - Hello?

921
00:48:03.711 --> 00:48:05.511
Please help us.

922
00:48:08.042 --> 00:48:10.011
I hope you enjoyed the food.

923
00:48:10.011 --> 00:48:11.952
It was fine.

924
00:48:12.051 --> 00:48:15.622
It wasn't as good as traditional Thai food that we had in Bangkok.

925
00:48:15.952 --> 00:48:17.091
Is that so?

926
00:48:17.151 --> 00:48:19.722
I wish you could have one more drink.

927
00:48:19.821 --> 00:48:21.292
I wish I could,

928
00:48:21.792 --> 00:48:25.191
but she has surgery tomorrow.

929
00:48:25.662 --> 00:48:27.031
We'll invite you next time.

930
00:48:27.461 --> 00:48:29.801
- Take care. - You too.

931
00:48:30.832 --> 00:48:32.801
It was good to meet you, Yoon Ah.

932
00:48:32.801 --> 00:48:33.901
You too.

933
00:48:34.102 --> 00:48:35.341
Let's go, Dong Gu.

934
00:48:35.341 --> 00:48:36.412
Okay.

935
00:48:38.642 --> 00:48:40.441
Get closer to me.

936
00:48:40.511 --> 00:48:41.711
Like this?

937
00:48:41.711 --> 00:48:43.881
Dong Gu, did I do well today?

938
00:48:43.881 --> 00:48:46.452
Your acting was amazing.

939
00:48:46.452 --> 00:48:47.722
It was excellent.

940
00:48:47.722 --> 00:48:48.852
Thank you.

941
00:48:49.821 --> 00:48:54.421
Why is my mother with your father...

942
00:48:56.492 --> 00:48:57.631
Could it be?

943
00:48:57.631 --> 00:48:59.231
- Could it be? - Could it be?

944
00:48:59.432 --> 00:49:00.502
No way.

945
00:49:00.832 --> 00:49:04.472
Does that mean that you're my father's daughter?

946
00:49:04.472 --> 00:49:06.642
Daughter? I'm sorry.

947
00:49:07.642 --> 00:49:09.272
Are you my half-sister?

948
00:49:09.272 --> 00:49:11.542
- Sister? - How could this be?

949
00:49:11.642 --> 00:49:13.711
That's impossible.

950
00:49:13.812 --> 00:49:16.682
Gosh, what's going on?

951
00:49:16.682 --> 00:49:18.582
Why do you think it's impossible?

952
00:49:18.582 --> 00:49:21.921
- "Why do you think so?" - Nothing is impossible.

953
00:49:22.122 --> 00:49:23.622
There are only...

954
00:49:24.522 --> 00:49:26.761
nasty desires that you want to hide.

955
00:49:26.761 --> 00:49:28.921
- I'm scared. - What are you talking about?

956
00:49:28.921 --> 00:49:31.932
30 years ago, you abandoned Yoo Geum Ran.

957
00:49:31.932 --> 00:49:34.332
- I know who that is. - Yoo Geum Ran?

958
00:49:34.332 --> 00:49:35.801
How do you know her?

959
00:49:35.801 --> 00:49:39.002
I'm her daughter.

960
00:49:39.171 --> 00:49:41.341
What did you say?

961
00:49:42.642 --> 00:49:44.242
Are you my daughter too?

962
00:49:44.242 --> 00:49:46.542
- It's his daughter. - My goodness.

963
00:49:46.542 --> 00:49:48.511
I made up my mind.

964
00:49:49.111 --> 00:49:50.682
I swore I'd get my revenge on you.

965
00:49:51.752 --> 00:49:52.781
What?

966
00:49:53.051 --> 00:49:54.122
You evil witch!

967
00:49:54.122 --> 00:49:56.051
- Evil witch. - Evil witch.

968
00:49:56.051 --> 00:49:57.292
You're an evil witch!

969
00:50:03.961 --> 00:50:05.361
- Bravo! - Bravo!

970
00:50:05.361 --> 00:50:07.662
- Bravo! - Bravo!

971
00:50:08.432 --> 00:50:10.131
There are no bounds to imagination.

972
00:50:10.131 --> 00:50:12.002
I can't help but give a big hand.

973
00:50:12.002 --> 00:50:13.801
You would've known that the father-in-law's wife was also...

974
00:50:13.801 --> 00:50:15.002
his daughter?

975
00:50:15.002 --> 00:50:16.011
Me too. Me too.

976
00:50:16.472 --> 00:50:18.441
How can I wait until tomorrow?

977
00:50:18.711 --> 00:50:21.341
- I'll die of curiosity. - Me too.

978
00:50:21.481 --> 00:50:22.481
What are you guys doing?

979
00:50:22.481 --> 00:50:24.252
- You guys are back. - Hi guys.

980
00:50:25.111 --> 00:50:26.551
How did it go?

981
00:50:26.551 --> 00:50:28.352
It didn't go so smoothly in the beginning,

982
00:50:28.352 --> 00:50:30.752
but Yoon Ah's better at acting than I'd expected.

983
00:50:30.752 --> 00:50:32.961
Really? Yoon Ah, that's pretty impressive.

984
00:50:32.961 --> 00:50:34.722
I just did what I could do.

985
00:50:34.992 --> 00:50:36.091
But...

986
00:50:36.461 --> 00:50:37.792
do you really think this will work?

987
00:50:37.792 --> 00:50:39.261
Of course it will.

988
00:50:39.261 --> 00:50:42.162
Soo Ah will have so many thoughts in her head by now.

989
00:50:42.361 --> 00:50:43.772
"Why on earth did I dump such a great guy like him?"

990
00:50:43.772 --> 00:50:46.171
"Was I a fool?" These are what she'll be asking herself.

991
00:50:46.702 --> 00:50:49.002
I sure do hope it turns out like you said.

992
00:50:49.671 --> 00:50:51.611
Anyway, did Sol cause you a lot of trouble?

993
00:50:51.611 --> 00:50:54.381
No, not at all. She only vomited 5 times, went poop 7 times,

994
00:50:54.381 --> 00:50:56.852
and peed about nine times.

995
00:50:56.852 --> 00:50:58.881
My goodness. She's doing something again right now.

996
00:50:58.881 --> 00:51:00.722
You can give Sol to me now. I'll take care of her.

997
00:51:00.722 --> 00:51:03.292
- It's about time. - It's all right, Sol.

998
00:51:03.292 --> 00:51:05.292
My arms are sore. I need something to eat. I'm starving.

999
00:51:05.292 --> 00:51:06.461
Yes, go ahead, and eat something.

1000
00:51:06.461 --> 00:51:08.591
- I think I'll go play a game. - You do that. Go on.

1001
00:51:08.591 --> 00:51:11.562
Sol, did you give your uncles a hard time?

1002
00:51:11.562 --> 00:51:13.461
Sol, did you miss Mommy?

1003
00:51:13.461 --> 00:51:16.702
Mommy missed you so much, Sol.

1004
00:51:16.702 --> 00:51:17.731
Did you just say "Mommy"?

1005
00:51:18.372 --> 00:51:19.702
What are you talking about?

1006
00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:24.599
Sol, did you miss Mommy?

1007
00:51:24.599 --> 00:51:27.840
Mommy missed you so much, Sol.

1008
00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:28.869
Did you just say "Mommy"?

1009
00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:30.840
What are you talking about?

1010
00:51:33.417 --> 00:51:35.348
Soo Ah, what brings you here?

1011
00:51:35.348 --> 00:51:36.817
- Yoon Ah left her purse. - What?

1012
00:51:37.488 --> 00:51:39.758
My goodness. I didn't know.

1013
00:51:40.187 --> 00:51:41.258
Thank you.

1014
00:51:41.627 --> 00:51:43.528
But why did she say "Mommy"? What is she talking about?

1015
00:51:43.828 --> 00:51:45.297
You two had a child?

1016
00:51:45.627 --> 00:51:46.727
Since when...

1017
00:51:47.598 --> 00:51:50.038
Were you two meeting while you and I were in a relationship?

1018
00:51:50.038 --> 00:51:53.008
No. What are you talking about? I'd be cursed if that were true.

1019
00:51:53.008 --> 00:51:55.808
Then how do you explain this?

1020
00:51:56.477 --> 00:51:58.508
Yoon Ah adores kids.

1021
00:51:58.508 --> 00:52:00.747
She lets kids call her "Mommy". It's just a habit.

1022
00:52:00.848 --> 00:52:02.647
- Isn't that right, Yoon Ah? - Exactly.

1023
00:52:02.647 --> 00:52:04.547
How could I have a child at my age?

1024
00:52:04.678 --> 00:52:07.017
- You're so cute. - Then who's baby is that?

1025
00:52:07.547 --> 00:52:08.547
Wait.

1026
00:52:08.917 --> 00:52:12.357
Come to think of it, isn't she the baby you said a guest left behind?

1027
00:52:12.357 --> 00:52:14.828
You see,

1028
00:52:16.028 --> 00:52:17.828
we decided to raise her.

1029
00:52:17.828 --> 00:52:20.767
Why? Why would you raise a stranger's child?

1030
00:52:21.267 --> 00:52:24.337
You see, the thing is...

1031
00:52:26.337 --> 00:52:27.408
she's Jun Ki's child.

1032
00:52:30.638 --> 00:52:32.747
What? She's Jun Ki's child?

1033
00:52:33.247 --> 00:52:35.348
Then the person that left that baby here was...

1034
00:52:35.348 --> 00:52:36.977
Jun Ki's girlfriend?

1035
00:52:37.178 --> 00:52:40.488
That's right. You know he's a low life. He's being punished.

1036
00:52:41.017 --> 00:52:42.118
Is this true, Jun Ki?

1037
00:52:49.028 --> 00:52:52.058
Yes. You know how much of a low life I am.

1038
00:52:52.058 --> 00:52:54.928
You're right. You're the type that would do something like this.

1039
00:52:55.297 --> 00:52:57.297
Thank you for bringing the purse.

1040
00:52:57.368 --> 00:52:59.607
It's late. You should get going.

1041
00:53:00.538 --> 00:53:02.368
We'd be sad to leave like this.

1042
00:53:03.008 --> 00:53:05.808
Give us a tour of the guesthouse. Let's have some beer as well.

1043
00:53:06.477 --> 00:53:07.808
Sounds great. Let's do that.

1044
00:53:07.808 --> 00:53:10.477
Yoon Ah. Why don't you take the two up to the third floor?

1045
00:53:10.477 --> 00:53:12.747
I'll be right up with the beers.

1046
00:53:12.747 --> 00:53:13.817
All right.

1047
00:53:13.817 --> 00:53:16.788
Sol, you can stay here with your dad.

1048
00:53:16.788 --> 00:53:20.627
Dad, Dad, Dad.

1049
00:53:21.488 --> 00:53:24.758
You're my daughter, aren't you?

1050
00:53:24.758 --> 00:53:26.167
- Follow me this way. - All right.

1051
00:53:26.667 --> 00:53:30.638
Go ahead upstairs. I'll be right up with the beers.

1052
00:53:32.167 --> 00:53:33.638
What do you think you're doing? Are you crazy?

1053
00:53:33.638 --> 00:53:35.707
I didn't know what to do. It just came out.

1054
00:53:38.678 --> 00:53:39.678
Never mind.

1055
00:53:40.477 --> 00:53:41.547
Don't mind me.

1056
00:53:41.778 --> 00:53:44.618
Don't worry about a low life like me. Go on upstairs.

1057
00:53:44.747 --> 00:53:46.288
- Forgive me, Jun Ki. - Don't touch me.

1058
00:53:46.288 --> 00:53:47.348
I'm really sorry.

1059
00:53:54.687 --> 00:53:55.758
My daughter?

1060
00:54:09.437 --> 00:54:11.578
What will I do? It's getting thicker and thicker.

1061
00:54:11.607 --> 00:54:13.977
If he finds out I have a mustache, there'll be no future with him.

1062
00:54:13.977 --> 00:54:15.178
This is driving me crazy.

1063
00:54:20.047 --> 00:54:21.187
I'm sleepy.

1064
00:54:22.017 --> 00:54:23.658
Why am I so sleepy?

1065
00:54:25.828 --> 00:54:26.857
Wake up.

1066
00:54:27.627 --> 00:54:30.598
I can't fall asleep. There's no way I can fall asleep.

1067
00:54:39.968 --> 00:54:41.538
I must've dozed off for a while.

1068
00:54:56.587 --> 00:54:57.587
What are you doing?

1069
00:54:57.587 --> 00:54:58.988
Seo Jin. It's not what you think.

1070
00:54:58.988 --> 00:55:00.687
I was just going to cover you with my coat. I thought you'd be cold.

1071
00:55:00.687 --> 00:55:02.187
I told you not to come close.

1072
00:55:05.098 --> 00:55:06.167
Tae Hyun.

1073
00:55:06.397 --> 00:55:08.627
Tae Hyun. Wake up.

1074
00:55:08.627 --> 00:55:11.138
Tae Hyun. Forgive me. I'm sorry.

1075
00:55:11.337 --> 00:55:13.008
Please wake up.

1076
00:55:13.937 --> 00:55:16.508
Tae Hyun. Are you all right? Are you conscious?

1077
00:55:17.278 --> 00:55:19.707
My head... My head hurts.

1078
00:55:27.547 --> 00:55:28.618
Hey. Do you...

1079
00:55:29.587 --> 00:55:31.457
have a mustache?

1080
00:55:34.957 --> 00:55:38.428
I'm so sorry.

1081
00:55:39.297 --> 00:55:41.727
I'm truly sorry.

1082
00:55:46.238 --> 00:55:48.937
The guesthouse is very nice. It's so cozy.

1083
00:55:50.278 --> 00:55:53.147
Yoon Ah insists I close the guesthouse and...

1084
00:55:53.147 --> 00:55:54.808
and focus on making films,

1085
00:55:54.808 --> 00:55:57.147
but it just doesn't feel right.

1086
00:55:57.377 --> 00:55:59.348
Without receiving Yoon Ah's financial support...

1087
00:55:59.348 --> 00:56:02.317
I want to succeed on my own.

1088
00:56:02.888 --> 00:56:04.517
I see.

1089
00:56:04.517 --> 00:56:05.758
Yoon Ah. I'm sorry...

1090
00:56:07.028 --> 00:56:08.627
for being so selfish.

1091
00:56:09.028 --> 00:56:10.497
Don't say that.

1092
00:56:14.468 --> 00:56:16.297
"Emergency! Sol's screaming and crying for food."

1093
00:56:16.297 --> 00:56:18.368
"I earnestly request that you come urgently."

1094
00:56:19.868 --> 00:56:22.638
Excuse me. I have to go to the restroom.

1095
00:56:24.578 --> 00:56:25.578
Well then...

1096
00:56:26.408 --> 00:56:27.408
Then...

1097
00:56:28.008 --> 00:56:29.917
why don't we toast to your dream?

1098
00:56:29.977 --> 00:56:31.047
Shall we?

1099
00:56:32.687 --> 00:56:34.087
We're out of beer.

1100
00:56:34.087 --> 00:56:36.417
I'll go and get some. I need to go to the restroom anyway.

1101
00:56:40.127 --> 00:56:41.158
All right.

1102
00:56:50.297 --> 00:56:52.437
Sol. Were you hungry?

1103
00:56:53.138 --> 00:56:55.008
Are you happy now that I'm breastfeeding you?

1104
00:56:55.107 --> 00:56:57.707
There you go, my little baby.

1105
00:56:57.977 --> 00:57:01.647
Let's eat. Let's eat.

1106
00:57:01.647 --> 00:57:03.817
There you go. Let's eat.

1107
00:57:07.348 --> 00:57:08.388
Jun Ki.

1108
00:57:09.687 --> 00:57:10.718
Yoon Ah.

1109
00:57:11.788 --> 00:57:12.828
What on earth...

1110
00:57:13.727 --> 00:57:15.428
are you doing right now?

1111
00:57:16.428 --> 00:57:19.297
- Soo Ah. - Why on earth...

1112
00:57:19.997 --> 00:57:23.437
are you breastfeeding Jun Ki's child?

1113
00:57:24.437 --> 00:57:26.638
Listen. Let me explain.

1114
00:57:26.638 --> 00:57:27.868
Yoon Ah. I bought the diapers.

1115
00:57:27.868 --> 00:57:29.808
Soo Ah. You're still here. My goodness. Soo Ah.

1116
00:57:30.107 --> 00:57:33.377
Jun Ki. Why is Yoon Ah breastfeeding your child?

1117
00:57:34.778 --> 00:57:36.317
You see, so...

1118
00:57:37.247 --> 00:57:39.017
She's donating breast milk. That's what she's doing.

1119
00:57:39.218 --> 00:57:41.448
You know how they say breast milk is good for immunity.

1120
00:57:41.448 --> 00:57:44.258
What? You're getting breast milk from Dong Gu's girlfriend?

1121
00:57:44.457 --> 00:57:45.488
Wait a minute.

1122
00:57:45.718 --> 00:57:47.357
How can an unmarried woman breastfeed?

1123
00:57:47.658 --> 00:57:49.727
That's right. She's not married.

1124
00:57:49.727 --> 00:57:53.397
But you see, occasionally, when she's in a good mood...

1125
00:57:53.397 --> 00:57:55.127
- if she tries real hard... - Stop the nonsense!

1126
00:57:55.468 --> 00:57:57.297
Yoon Ah. You explain.

1127
00:57:57.297 --> 00:57:58.598
What's going on here?

1128
00:57:58.598 --> 00:58:00.868
Well, you see...

1129
00:58:01.707 --> 00:58:04.308
To tell you the truth, Sol's my daughter.

1130
00:58:04.408 --> 00:58:06.278
What? She's your daughter?

1131
00:58:06.408 --> 00:58:07.477
You said she's your daughter earlier.

1132
00:58:07.477 --> 00:58:09.547
That's right. She was my daughter. No, she's my daughter.

1133
00:58:09.547 --> 00:58:11.718
You said your ex-girlfriend left her here.

1134
00:58:11.718 --> 00:58:13.388
Then how can she be Yoon Ah's child?

1135
00:58:13.388 --> 00:58:16.658
Then Yoon Ah's your ex-girlfriend? That's impossible.

1136
00:58:22.727 --> 00:58:24.727
Why do you think it's impossible?

1137
00:58:25.558 --> 00:58:27.598
Nothing is impossible.

1138
00:58:27.928 --> 00:58:30.638
There are only nasty desires that you want to hide.

1139
00:58:30.868 --> 00:58:32.508
What are you talking about?

1140
00:58:33.207 --> 00:58:35.437
Then you're saying Yoon Ah's your ex-girlfriend,

1141
00:58:35.437 --> 00:58:37.937
and this child is yours and Yoon Ah's child?

1142
00:58:38.908 --> 00:58:40.578
I wanted to keep this a secret.

1143
00:58:41.178 --> 00:58:42.647
Then do you mean Dong Gu doesn't know about this?

1144
00:58:42.647 --> 00:58:44.647
At first, I was going to tell him,

1145
00:58:44.877 --> 00:58:46.917
but he was so heartbroken after breaking up with you...

1146
00:58:46.917 --> 00:58:48.618
that I couldn't find the heart to tell him.

1147
00:58:49.317 --> 00:58:51.218
Yoon Ah. Is this all true?

1148
00:58:51.218 --> 00:58:53.357
Well, actually...

1149
00:58:53.357 --> 00:58:54.687
Shut your mouth, Yoon Ah!

1150
00:58:54.928 --> 00:58:56.928
You don't have any right to say a word.

1151
00:58:56.928 --> 00:59:00.828
Soo Ah. This girl will do anything to get what she wants.

1152
00:59:00.828 --> 00:59:03.937
You're the only person that can save Dong Gu from that evil witch.

1153
00:59:04.337 --> 00:59:06.837
Can you please take Dong Gu back?

1154
00:59:10.678 --> 00:59:11.707
I beg you.

1155
00:59:13.348 --> 00:59:14.477
- Jun Ki. - What?

1156
00:59:14.477 --> 00:59:16.118
- Did you plan this with Dong Gu? - No.

1157
00:59:16.118 --> 00:59:18.118
You know exactly what happens if I catch you in a lie, don't you?

1158
00:59:18.678 --> 00:59:20.317
Look me straight in the eye.

1159
00:59:20.687 --> 00:59:22.118
You're in this together, aren't you?

1160
00:59:22.558 --> 00:59:24.187
I don't think so.

1161
00:59:24.558 --> 00:59:26.087
You still don't get it, do you?

1162
00:59:26.658 --> 00:59:29.828
- You still won't tell the truth? - I will. I'll tell you everything.

1163
00:59:29.828 --> 00:59:32.227
- So what is it? - You see, tiny pieces...

1164
00:59:32.227 --> 00:59:34.997
- added up and became huge. - What are you talking about?

1165
00:59:34.997 --> 00:59:35.997
You see...

1166
00:59:35.997 --> 00:59:36.997
I can't forget...

1167
00:59:36.997 --> 00:59:40.607
the night sky I saw at Yoon Ah's vacation home in Malibu.

1168
00:59:40.908 --> 00:59:45.138
It seemed as though gold dust was sprinkled in the sky.

1169
00:59:47.047 --> 00:59:49.678
Why don't the four of us go together sometime?

1170
00:59:49.848 --> 00:59:51.348
I'd love that.

1171
00:59:51.948 --> 00:59:53.047
Great.

1172
00:59:53.647 --> 00:59:54.848
You're back.

1173
00:59:55.047 --> 00:59:57.957
Soo Ah. Yoon Seok and I were just talking about...

1174
00:59:58.058 --> 01:00:00.687
going to Yoon Ah's vacation home in Malibu together sometime.

1175
01:00:00.687 --> 01:00:01.957
You're okay with that, right?

1176
01:00:03.758 --> 01:00:05.297
Why are you looking at me like that?

1177
01:00:05.698 --> 01:00:07.067
Is there something on my face?

1178
01:00:07.428 --> 01:00:09.028
No. It's on the back of your head.

1179
01:00:09.028 --> 01:00:10.167
I'll get it off for you.

1180
01:00:20.308 --> 01:00:22.047
Soo Ah. Soo Ah.

1181
01:00:22.047 --> 01:00:24.448
Soo Ah. I was wrong. I'm really sorry.

1182
01:00:24.647 --> 01:00:26.788
Let go of me before I smack you again.

1183
01:00:27.147 --> 01:00:28.448
Wait a minute. Soo Ah.

1184
01:00:28.448 --> 01:00:30.357
I wouldn't have done this if I don't mean this.

1185
01:00:30.718 --> 01:00:33.388
I really love you. I can't break up with you.

1186
01:00:33.687 --> 01:00:35.797
Is that right? What a shame though.

1187
01:00:35.897 --> 01:00:38.558
I have no feelings left for you whatsoever now.

1188
01:00:39.428 --> 01:00:41.727
I never want to see you again.

1189
01:00:41.828 --> 01:00:44.038
So don't ever show your face in front of me again.

1190
01:00:45.937 --> 01:00:47.368
Soo Ah. Soo Ah.

1191
01:00:49.238 --> 01:00:50.377
Soo Ah.

1192
01:01:09.328 --> 01:01:11.698
Dong Gu. Stop drinking.

1193
01:01:11.828 --> 01:01:14.828
Dong Gu. Stop drinking. You've had too much to drink.

1194
01:01:14.897 --> 01:01:16.098
Leave me alone.

1195
01:01:16.337 --> 01:01:19.607
I plan on drinking until I die. Don't stop me.

1196
01:01:20.167 --> 01:01:22.607
Things never end well if we listen to you.

1197
01:01:23.038 --> 01:01:24.977
I didn't know things would get so complicated.

1198
01:01:25.678 --> 01:01:26.877
Gosh.

1199
01:01:42.428 --> 01:01:45.698
Both the brother and sister are pathetic. I can't believe this.

1200
01:01:48.767 --> 01:01:49.837
Be quiet, you wench!

1201
01:01:49.837 --> 01:01:51.598
Tae Hyun.

1202
01:01:51.698 --> 01:01:53.667
Soo Ah!

1203
01:01:55.538 --> 01:01:56.837
This is so exhausting.

1204
01:01:56.837 --> 01:02:00.778
- Tae Hyun. - Soo Ah!

1205
01:02:01.977 --> 01:02:03.417
Come down. Come down.

1206
01:02:03.417 --> 01:02:04.477
It's so noisy because of you.

1207
01:02:05.317 --> 01:02:07.448
Soo Ah!

1208
01:02:12.017 --> 01:02:13.587
Stop drinking. Stop drinking.

1209
01:02:15.828 --> 01:02:18.857
Let go. Don't stop me.

1210
01:02:32.547 --> 01:02:35.817
(Welcome to Waikiki)

1211
01:02:35.817 --> 01:02:37.678
How much longer are you going to be like this?

1212
01:02:37.678 --> 01:02:39.388
A new girl will help you forget about her.

1213
01:02:39.388 --> 01:02:41.747
I'm sure you'll meet someone better. Cheer up.

1214
01:02:41.848 --> 01:02:45.058
Kim Hee Ja? The top actress in Korea, Kim Hee Ja?

1215
01:02:45.058 --> 01:02:46.988
I'll do anything you say, Director!

1216
01:02:46.988 --> 01:02:50.098
This is a story about swimmers. I've never seen hairy swimmers.

1217
01:02:50.098 --> 01:02:53.028
Hello. I'll be doing your waxing today.

1218
01:02:54.528 --> 01:02:55.868
Does this mean this is the end of my life as a man?

1219
01:02:55.868 --> 01:02:57.267
Lee Jun Ki's life is doomed!

1220
01:02:57.567 --> 01:03:00.038
Seo Jin. Would you like to be my girlfriend?

1221
01:03:00.038 --> 01:03:02.578
They think they're characters in a movie. I can't stand them.

1222
01:03:03.078 --> 01:03:05.178
He picks his nose all the time.

1223
01:03:05.178 --> 01:03:07.908
He doesn't wash his hands afterwards and eats kimbab with them.

1224
01:03:07.908 --> 01:03:09.917
He even pinches my cheeks. I thought I was going crazy.

1225
01:03:09.917 --> 01:03:11.218
He's getting married soon.

1226
01:03:11.218 --> 01:03:13.718
How do you think he'll feel when he finds out Yoon Ah had his child?

1227
01:03:13.718 --> 01:03:15.788
What did you just say? She gave birth to my child?

1228
01:03:15.788 --> 01:03:17.187
Do you intend to ruin my life?

1229
01:03:17.187 --> 01:03:19.187
You should be grateful that I'm even giving you this.

1230
01:03:19.187 --> 01:03:21.457
How do I know you're not playing games with me?

1231
01:03:21.687 --> 01:03:22.797
Wait a minute!
