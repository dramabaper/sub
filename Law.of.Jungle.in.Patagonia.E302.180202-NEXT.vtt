1
00:00:08.697 --> 00:00:14.068
(How far have you gone in the jungle?)

2
00:00:14.706 --> 00:00:18.546
(The end of the world)

3
00:00:20.976 --> 00:00:24.147
(Patagonia)

4
00:00:26.616 --> 00:00:28.257
In this cold weather,

5
00:00:28.656 --> 00:00:30.656
we're going to more intense places.

6
00:00:30.656 --> 00:00:32.026
(It's bitterly cold and windy, but I must keep going.)

7
00:00:32.026 --> 00:00:34.626
(When will this road end?)

8
00:00:34.626 --> 00:00:35.857
I felt hopeless.

9
00:00:38.827 --> 00:00:40.397
(Screaming)

10
00:00:43.137 --> 00:00:44.567
(For the past few days, I've only seen ice.)

11
00:00:44.567 --> 00:00:46.007
What's that?

12
00:00:46.736 --> 00:00:47.736
Be careful.

13
00:00:47.836 --> 00:00:49.806
This doesn't feel real.

14
00:00:51.007 --> 00:00:53.476
It was so cold that I couldn't move.

15
00:00:54.077 --> 00:00:56.717
I think this is the worst place.

16
00:00:56.717 --> 00:00:57.846
(I'm so cold that I can't move. This must be the worst place.)

17
00:00:58.387 --> 00:00:59.986
Should I give up?

18
00:00:59.986 --> 00:01:00.986
(My body is telling me to give up.)

19
00:01:00.986 --> 00:01:01.986
(Can I endure until the end?)

20
00:01:01.986 --> 00:01:03.687
Can I endure this?

21
00:01:03.757 --> 00:01:04.827
It's raining so much.

22
00:01:05.126 --> 00:01:06.896
It's so cold.

23
00:01:07.656 --> 00:01:09.557
I was in sheer terror.

24
00:01:09.557 --> 00:01:10.867
(Will my body withstand this? I'm very afraid.)

25
00:01:14.937 --> 00:01:18.967
It wasn't a situation where somebody could lend a hand.

26
00:01:19.206 --> 00:01:21.477
It was a fight within myself.

27
00:01:21.736 --> 00:01:24.706
We came this far. We couldn't stop.

28
00:01:24.706 --> 00:01:25.846
It was a war with the cold,

29
00:01:26.247 --> 00:01:27.417
the rain,

30
00:01:27.876 --> 00:01:28.917
and hypothermia.

31
00:01:29.346 --> 00:01:31.187
(This survival is a war.)

32
00:01:31.646 --> 00:01:34.687
A special project of The Law of Jungle in 2018.

33
00:01:34.887 --> 00:01:36.387
A project to conquer the end of the earth.

34
00:01:37.456 --> 00:01:41.156
("Pata" means feet and "Gon" means big.)

35
00:01:41.956 --> 00:01:43.796
The land of giants with big feet.

36
00:01:47.766 --> 00:01:49.266
The overwhelming magnificence.

37
00:01:51.036 --> 00:01:53.266
It's where Mother Nature exhales deeply.

38
00:01:53.777 --> 00:01:56.406
Patagonia is the dynamic land at the end of the world.

39
00:01:56.406 --> 00:01:59.107
(The dynamic land of Patagonia)

40
00:01:59.406 --> 00:02:01.876
It's a big project spanning 4,000km.

41
00:02:02.176 --> 00:02:03.887
South, Central, and the North...

42
00:02:04.087 --> 00:02:06.046
have their own extreme survival conditions.

43
00:02:06.087 --> 00:02:08.217
They must conquer the land of Patagonia.

44
00:02:09.356 --> 00:02:10.756
As soon as the sun goes down,

45
00:02:11.256 --> 00:02:12.457
it turns into a devil.

46
00:02:12.756 --> 00:02:15.027
I've never been this cold in my life.

47
00:02:15.096 --> 00:02:17.527
I thought I was going to die. We were going to die.

48
00:02:17.666 --> 00:02:18.927
There are no living things here.

49
00:02:19.066 --> 00:02:21.297
There are water, ice, and rocks.

50
00:02:21.737 --> 00:02:23.237
(They only have ice to eat.)

51
00:02:23.237 --> 00:02:25.307
Everybody was hungry,

52
00:02:25.307 --> 00:02:28.337
so I wanted to provide some help,

53
00:02:28.576 --> 00:02:30.247
but it was cold for me too.

54
00:02:30.247 --> 00:02:32.177
That's enough. Stop it.

55
00:02:32.177 --> 00:02:34.147
- I'll get just two more. - Goodness.

56
00:02:34.147 --> 00:02:35.217
I'm okay right now.

57
00:02:35.517 --> 00:02:36.517
It's good.

58
00:02:36.517 --> 00:02:37.547
(Falling)

59
00:02:37.547 --> 00:02:38.717
(The icy cold rages on.)

60
00:02:38.717 --> 00:02:42.217
It was like the windy Himalayas.

61
00:02:43.687 --> 00:02:46.587
There's nothing here. We can't survive.

62
00:02:47.096 --> 00:02:49.297
What are we supposed to catch? You call this a jungle?

63
00:02:49.297 --> 00:02:50.767
(It's the land of death without a single tree.)

64
00:02:50.767 --> 00:02:51.767
Is this Dubai?

65
00:02:52.267 --> 00:02:53.696
What can we eat here?

66
00:02:53.867 --> 00:02:56.536
We thought hard and thought about whatever we can.

67
00:02:56.636 --> 00:02:58.307
- He caught it. - Really?

68
00:02:58.307 --> 00:02:59.867
Come out, Chief.

69
00:02:59.867 --> 00:03:02.837
I panicked in the cold water. It was scary.

70
00:03:02.837 --> 00:03:04.446
It felt like I was getting sucked in.

71
00:03:05.547 --> 00:03:08.476
We had to climb the Alpine region.

72
00:03:08.717 --> 00:03:13.047
This was the most painful variety show I've been on.

73
00:03:13.047 --> 00:03:14.617
(They head to the altitude of 5,000m.)

74
00:03:15.656 --> 00:03:16.756
Be careful.

75
00:03:17.256 --> 00:03:18.756
(Every step is full of pain.)

76
00:03:20.126 --> 00:03:22.196
- Let's do this. - Shall we keep going? Let's go.

77
00:03:22.756 --> 00:03:24.397
(It's the worst terrain and the weather.)

78
00:03:25.527 --> 00:03:26.566
My gosh.

79
00:03:26.997 --> 00:03:28.596
I'm in pain.

80
00:03:28.867 --> 00:03:30.096
(They get altitude sickness in the heavy rain.)

81
00:03:30.096 --> 00:03:32.406
- Go ahead. - We have to go down.

82
00:03:32.406 --> 00:03:35.636
I can't collapse here. I can't stop.

83
00:03:35.636 --> 00:03:37.277
(I can't collapse here. I can't stop.)

84
00:03:37.506 --> 00:03:40.846
(We can't stop this reckless ordeal because we are there already.)

85
00:03:40.846 --> 00:03:43.946
When I first started The Law of Jungle,

86
00:03:43.946 --> 00:03:46.147
this was the country I wanted to go to.

87
00:03:46.517 --> 00:03:48.487
It's the land of Chief Byung Man's dreams.

88
00:03:49.286 --> 00:03:51.427
Will I ever get a chance to go there?

89
00:03:51.656 --> 00:03:53.656
It's the farthest country from Korea.

90
00:03:53.897 --> 00:03:56.096
If you pierce through Korea on a globe, Chile is on the other side.

91
00:03:56.096 --> 00:03:57.126
(It's on the opposite side of the earth.)

92
00:03:57.566 --> 00:04:00.297
It's the country with the world's attention in 2018.

93
00:04:00.397 --> 00:04:01.467
It's amazing.

94
00:04:02.066 --> 00:04:04.767
This is like a drama or a movie.

95
00:04:04.767 --> 00:04:05.767
(It's paradise on earth with its reddish body of water.)

96
00:04:06.876 --> 00:04:10.506
I was awed by the magnitude.

97
00:04:10.506 --> 00:04:12.876
I don't think I can contain this in a picture.

98
00:04:12.976 --> 00:04:14.277
- When will we get to see this? - When will we ever see this?

99
00:04:14.277 --> 00:04:15.946
I know. We can't.

100
00:04:17.347 --> 00:04:18.347
My gosh.

101
00:04:18.347 --> 00:04:19.516
(Patagonia in Chile is the gift of Mother Nature.)

102
00:04:19.516 --> 00:04:22.657
This is the gift of the jungle.

103
00:04:22.657 --> 00:04:24.626
It's the land of dreamers, full of inspirations.

104
00:04:24.626 --> 00:04:25.626
Look at the stars.

105
00:04:27.196 --> 00:04:28.626
- Look. - My gosh.

106
00:04:28.626 --> 00:04:31.466
The stars were so pretty.

107
00:04:31.466 --> 00:04:32.466
(It's the world where reality and fantasy meet.)

108
00:04:33.867 --> 00:04:35.297
(There are inspirations everywhere they look.)

109
00:04:35.297 --> 00:04:36.466
I didn't know Chile...

110
00:04:37.466 --> 00:04:38.636
was like this.

111
00:04:39.167 --> 00:04:42.206
It was beautiful and fantastic.

112
00:04:42.206 --> 00:04:44.446
(This was where "Gulliver's Travels" was born.)

113
00:04:44.446 --> 00:04:46.047
- Right in front of us. - What is that?

114
00:04:46.047 --> 00:04:47.446
- Right there. - Isn't that it?

115
00:04:47.446 --> 00:04:49.047
- There. - I see it.

116
00:04:49.076 --> 00:04:50.547
- It's the whale. - You're right.

117
00:04:50.547 --> 00:04:51.646
- Right? - I see it.

118
00:04:51.646 --> 00:04:53.047
You're right. I see it.

119
00:04:53.047 --> 00:04:56.956
It looks like the Nazca Lines of the Inca Empire.

120
00:04:56.956 --> 00:04:58.357
(They come across the Nazca Lines of the Inca Empire.)

121
00:04:58.357 --> 00:04:59.487
It was wonderful.

122
00:05:00.357 --> 00:05:04.266
(In novels and movies, it was the symbol of fantasy and fear.)

123
00:05:04.497 --> 00:05:07.037
(They get to see the legendary whale, Moby Dick,)

124
00:05:07.037 --> 00:05:08.297
(in front of their eyes.)

125
00:05:08.297 --> 00:05:10.607
It's the whale. It's right in front of us.

126
00:05:11.066 --> 00:05:12.667
It's the whale.

127
00:05:12.667 --> 00:05:14.206
Look.

128
00:05:14.206 --> 00:05:16.276
(Your imaginations will become a reality.)

129
00:05:16.276 --> 00:05:17.876
- It's huge. - I couldn't see it.

130
00:05:18.107 --> 00:05:19.146
They must be nearby.

131
00:05:19.146 --> 00:05:20.347
Look.

132
00:05:20.376 --> 00:05:21.876
- It's a dolphin. - Are you sure?

133
00:05:21.876 --> 00:05:23.117
It's not a dolphin.

134
00:05:23.117 --> 00:05:26.547
"Is this for real?" That's what I was thinking.

135
00:05:26.617 --> 00:05:29.016
These moments are like miracles.

136
00:05:29.187 --> 00:05:30.626
They're cute.

137
00:05:30.626 --> 00:05:31.956
They're so cute.

138
00:05:31.956 --> 00:05:33.826
- He's waiting. - Good job.

139
00:05:33.826 --> 00:05:35.557
- We got to see penguins too. - Right?

140
00:05:35.557 --> 00:05:37.896
- Dolphins too. - My gosh.

141
00:05:37.896 --> 00:05:39.466
We saw seals too.

142
00:05:39.466 --> 00:05:40.466
Come closer.

143
00:05:40.466 --> 00:05:42.636
(You can't express these overwhelming moments in words.)

144
00:05:42.636 --> 00:05:45.066
The jungle is a nice present.

145
00:05:45.066 --> 00:05:46.136
(Face the delightful moments.)

146
00:05:46.136 --> 00:05:47.177
It's hard to explain.

147
00:05:48.206 --> 00:05:49.636
(It's fierce and intense.)

148
00:05:49.636 --> 00:05:53.506
I couldn't stop. I had tears drop from both of my eyes.

149
00:05:54.376 --> 00:05:57.086
The passionate survival of 13 members of Byung Man's Tribe...

150
00:05:57.086 --> 00:05:59.646
in Patagonia, Chile, the end of the world.

151
00:06:00.256 --> 00:06:02.716
(The Law of Jungle in 2018, a project to conquer the world)

152
00:06:02.716 --> 00:06:04.657
The Law of Jungle in Patagonia.

153
00:06:04.756 --> 00:06:06.256
- We did it! - We did it!

154
00:06:06.256 --> 00:06:09.956
Thank you, Patagonia.

155
00:06:10.626 --> 00:06:13.896
Let me introduce the 35th Byung Man's Tribe.

156
00:06:14.737 --> 00:06:17.766
- The Law of Jungle in... - Patagonia.

157
00:06:17.766 --> 00:06:18.766
Let's get...

158
00:06:18.766 --> 00:06:21.006
- Started now - Started now

159
00:06:21.006 --> 00:06:22.607
(Get up, Byung Man.)

160
00:06:24.177 --> 00:06:26.407
Hello, viewers of The Law of Jungle.

161
00:06:26.607 --> 00:06:27.917
Nice to meet you. It's Hong Jin Young.

162
00:06:27.917 --> 00:06:29.076
(The popular star is here to take over the jungle.)

163
00:06:29.946 --> 00:06:33.187
(She's the queen of festivals.)

164
00:06:33.187 --> 00:06:35.917
(She's like gold in festivals and TV shows.)

165
00:06:36.357 --> 00:06:40.857
I heard you've been on all shows except for the news.

166
00:06:40.857 --> 00:06:42.297
That's right. You're right.

167
00:06:43.157 --> 00:06:46.566
Except for the news and The Law of Jungle.

168
00:06:46.566 --> 00:06:48.266
Before I appear on shows,

169
00:06:48.266 --> 00:06:51.607
I have a general idea of how it'll go,

170
00:06:52.136 --> 00:06:54.076
but I have no idea for this one.

171
00:06:55.276 --> 00:06:58.876
(She doesn't need to have any ideas.)

172
00:06:58.876 --> 00:07:01.146
(She has already got a hang of it.)

173
00:07:01.146 --> 00:07:02.376
(As soon as she arrives...)

174
00:07:02.376 --> 00:07:03.816
(Where are the rabbits?)

175
00:07:04.247 --> 00:07:05.946
(She's getting started again.)

176
00:07:05.946 --> 00:07:07.987
(You, rabbits)

177
00:07:08.417 --> 00:07:11.557
(She celebrates cheerfully.)

178
00:07:11.557 --> 00:07:13.597
(They haven't started yet.)

179
00:07:13.597 --> 00:07:15.526
(Do we need to do a drug screen on her?)

180
00:07:15.526 --> 00:07:19.626
(When she gets too excited, she makes other people tired.)

181
00:07:19.626 --> 00:07:22.636
(The Chief needs some stage lighting.)

182
00:07:22.636 --> 00:07:24.336
(Jin Young has the Chief manual to control him.)

183
00:07:25.006 --> 00:07:26.667
I think she dragged me around.

184
00:07:27.206 --> 00:07:29.076
The Chief is so friendly

185
00:07:29.076 --> 00:07:30.206
I'm not dancing right now.

186
00:07:30.206 --> 00:07:32.177
She's just singing,

187
00:07:32.177 --> 00:07:33.677
and my body is moving along.

188
00:07:33.677 --> 00:07:35.076
(She's like a remote control that even makes Byung Man dance.)

189
00:07:35.076 --> 00:07:38.287
Chief, we want some trout.

190
00:07:38.446 --> 00:07:40.687
- Don't go in. - Then what?

191
00:07:40.687 --> 00:07:42.287
- You're not going in? - I'll go in.

192
00:07:42.287 --> 00:07:43.316
Don't go in.

193
00:07:43.316 --> 00:07:44.927
Her eyes are scary.

194
00:07:45.256 --> 00:07:46.956
She's not letting me decide.

195
00:07:47.427 --> 00:07:49.196
Are you bored? No, right?

196
00:07:49.326 --> 00:07:50.597
Byung Man.

197
00:07:50.597 --> 00:07:51.826
- Byung Man. - Byung Man.

198
00:07:51.826 --> 00:07:52.896
Shut it, punk.

199
00:07:52.896 --> 00:07:54.237
(Leave me alone, punk.)

200
00:07:54.867 --> 00:07:57.437
That was Jin Young in Chile.

201
00:07:58.506 --> 00:08:03.107
(Who is this innocent girl that's unlike Jin Young?)

202
00:08:03.646 --> 00:08:06.547
Hello, I'm Chae Yeon of DIA.

203
00:08:06.547 --> 00:08:08.076
(She's here to melt the jungle.)

204
00:08:09.316 --> 00:08:14.117
(She was the angel in an idol survival show,)

205
00:08:14.117 --> 00:08:18.427
(and she's everybody's first love now.)

206
00:08:18.427 --> 00:08:23.196
(With her beautiful face, she has also shot many commercials.)

207
00:08:23.196 --> 00:08:25.097
I try not to look too innocent.

208
00:08:25.097 --> 00:08:28.396
(She's trying to look less innocent.)

209
00:08:29.297 --> 00:08:33.637
(She transforms 360 degrees.)

210
00:08:33.836 --> 00:08:36.236
(You've changed a bit.)

211
00:08:36.236 --> 00:08:39.946
(She works hard.)

212
00:08:40.547 --> 00:08:43.377
I have the most energy and strength out of the members.

213
00:08:44.147 --> 00:08:46.446
(She works energetically.)

214
00:08:46.446 --> 00:08:49.316
(She looks even more beautiful.)

215
00:08:49.316 --> 00:08:50.356
Chae Yeon is a doll.

216
00:08:51.187 --> 00:08:52.826
She's like the Anne of Green Gables.

217
00:08:53.826 --> 00:08:55.257
Chae Yeon was next to me.

218
00:08:55.257 --> 00:08:56.557
(She's the idol of idols.)

219
00:08:56.557 --> 00:08:59.326
What was I supposed to do? She was so pretty.

220
00:08:59.326 --> 00:09:00.836
When you look at her,

221
00:09:00.836 --> 00:09:02.897
she's so light-skinned and cute,

222
00:09:03.336 --> 00:09:05.637
but she also gives us good energy.

223
00:09:06.037 --> 00:09:07.736
Are they doing this to take their shirts off?

224
00:09:07.736 --> 00:09:09.907
Why are you doing push-ups?

225
00:09:10.106 --> 00:09:11.606
You came. Go away.

226
00:09:11.606 --> 00:09:12.677
(It's hard being beautiful.)

227
00:09:12.677 --> 00:09:14.846
- It's a bee. Don't move. - My gosh.

228
00:09:15.246 --> 00:09:16.346
Don't move, Chae Yeon.

229
00:09:16.346 --> 00:09:18.116
(She can't keep a straight face in emergencies.)

230
00:09:18.116 --> 00:09:19.647
- I'm really scared. - I'll hit it.

231
00:09:20.257 --> 00:09:24.856
(Please look forward to Chae Yeon, the muse of the jungle.)

232
00:09:24.856 --> 00:09:26.996
(The two jungle veterans are back.)

233
00:09:26.996 --> 00:09:29.427
Hello, it's Kim Seung Soo. Nice to meet you.

234
00:09:29.427 --> 00:09:31.366
(He's back after the Indian Ocean special 4 years ago.)

235
00:09:31.366 --> 00:09:34.366
(Last time in the jungle,)

236
00:09:34.366 --> 00:09:37.236
(he was cute,)

237
00:09:37.236 --> 00:09:38.437
(but also bold.)

238
00:09:38.866 --> 00:09:40.407
(But now,)

239
00:09:40.407 --> 00:09:42.137
(he wants to cut an animal's head and drain its blood.)

240
00:09:42.236 --> 00:09:44.147
(He's decapitating a turkey.)

241
00:09:44.976 --> 00:09:46.476
(He's scary.)

242
00:09:46.476 --> 00:09:48.647
(He comes back as a survival master.)

243
00:09:48.647 --> 00:09:50.716
I've experienced it before,

244
00:09:50.716 --> 00:09:52.716
so I think I can save myself.

245
00:09:52.946 --> 00:09:55.816
You have many new nicknames.

246
00:09:55.816 --> 00:09:57.956
(Laughing)

247
00:09:58.486 --> 00:09:59.657
(He's embarrassed and hesitant.)

248
00:09:59.657 --> 00:10:02.996
I'm grateful. People say I resemble Leonardo DiCaprio,

249
00:10:02.996 --> 00:10:06.566
so they call me Leonardo Seung Soo.

250
00:10:07.596 --> 00:10:08.897
The flower looks great on you.

251
00:10:09.466 --> 00:10:12.466
(He's a middle-aged man who looks great with a flower.)

252
00:10:12.466 --> 00:10:14.907
It's really cold, right? You're so brave.

253
00:10:16.407 --> 00:10:20.517
(He's a warm-hearted person who takes good care of the members.)

254
00:10:20.517 --> 00:10:23.746
(This guy runs into the icy water.)

255
00:10:23.746 --> 00:10:27.517
(It's Little Byung Man, Kim Dong Jun.)

256
00:10:28.316 --> 00:10:31.187
(He transformed into a strong actor.)

257
00:10:31.356 --> 00:10:33.527
(Will he survive strongly as well?)

258
00:10:33.897 --> 00:10:36.297
I have to be better than three years ago.

259
00:10:36.797 --> 00:10:38.966
I want the viewers to remember...

260
00:10:38.966 --> 00:10:41.667
that I'm the little Byung Man.

261
00:10:42.066 --> 00:10:45.336
(He was the strongest idol member in the jungle.)

262
00:10:45.336 --> 00:10:49.106
(He swam comfortably in the sea of Borneo.)

263
00:10:49.106 --> 00:10:51.047
(4 years ago, he earned himself the title of Little Byung Man.)

264
00:10:51.047 --> 00:10:53.007
(Chief Byung Man approved his skills.)

265
00:10:53.816 --> 00:10:55.116
(It's a rabbit.)

266
00:10:55.616 --> 00:10:57.187
(He's here to conquer the land.)

267
00:10:57.187 --> 00:10:58.887
(If a prey appears,)

268
00:10:58.887 --> 00:11:01.086
(he starts running like an energizer.)

269
00:11:01.086 --> 00:11:04.356
(It's a turkey this time.)

270
00:11:04.356 --> 00:11:06.387
(Run again.)

271
00:11:06.387 --> 00:11:08.726
(He never runs out of energy.)

272
00:11:08.726 --> 00:11:11.897
(He's the jungle fighter with the best physique.)

273
00:11:13.196 --> 00:11:15.566
(These two men turn the scenery into a photoshoot.)

274
00:11:15.566 --> 00:11:16.937
It's a great picture.

275
00:11:16.937 --> 00:11:19.637
(Who is this other handsome man?)

276
00:11:19.637 --> 00:11:23.807
(He looks great.)

277
00:11:24.277 --> 00:11:27.716
I'm JR of NU'EST W.

278
00:11:28.216 --> 00:11:29.246
Hello.

279
00:11:29.246 --> 00:11:30.316
Since my début,

280
00:11:30.316 --> 00:11:34.356
I wanted to be on The Law of Jungle,

281
00:11:34.356 --> 00:11:37.787
and it became a reality now.

282
00:11:37.986 --> 00:11:40.996
(The icon of reversal makes it to the jungle.)

283
00:11:40.996 --> 00:11:44.096
(With the background, it looks like a work of art.)

284
00:11:44.297 --> 00:11:45.897
I was wondering what it tasted like.

285
00:11:45.897 --> 00:11:46.937
(He takes a bite of the glacier.)

286
00:11:46.937 --> 00:11:48.537
- It tastes spicy. - What?

287
00:11:48.537 --> 00:11:49.566
I'm not sure.

288
00:11:49.566 --> 00:11:51.137
(He's weird.)

289
00:11:51.807 --> 00:11:53.007
I like to play games,

290
00:11:53.807 --> 00:11:55.537
and I like animations.

291
00:11:55.976 --> 00:11:58.446
In "Pokemon" or "Digimon Adventure",

292
00:11:58.446 --> 00:12:00.346
Wartortle is the hidden character.

293
00:12:00.346 --> 00:12:02.316
I like things like that.

294
00:12:02.576 --> 00:12:05.746
It feels like I'm inside a game.

295
00:12:06.187 --> 00:12:08.856
(JR has joined the jungle hunting.)

296
00:12:09.616 --> 00:12:12.326
(He drinks the strawberry potion before hunting.)

297
00:12:12.326 --> 00:12:14.326
(JR's level went up.)

298
00:12:14.326 --> 00:12:16.726
(He's in combat with a prey.)

299
00:12:16.726 --> 00:12:18.627
(It's a fierce combat.)

300
00:12:18.627 --> 00:12:21.866
(I stepped on poop.)

301
00:12:21.866 --> 00:12:25.336
(JR's level went down.)

302
00:12:26.137 --> 00:12:28.037
You, rabbits.

303
00:12:29.736 --> 00:12:32.047
(And finally,)

304
00:12:33.277 --> 00:12:35.816
(the queen is in the jungle.)

305
00:12:36.177 --> 00:12:38.746
Chief, I'm here.

306
00:12:39.687 --> 00:12:40.687
What are we going to eat?

307
00:12:42.757 --> 00:12:46.287
(Kim Sung Ryoung is every woman's ideal image of beauty.)

308
00:12:47.356 --> 00:12:49.657
- Excuse me. - An actress' face is burning.

309
00:12:51.127 --> 00:12:53.466
Oh, dear. An actress' face is getting tanned.

310
00:12:53.736 --> 00:12:54.866
This is great.

311
00:12:54.866 --> 00:12:56.297
Is this good? Great.

312
00:12:56.297 --> 00:12:58.706
- This is it. - Let me know if the sun moves.

313
00:12:58.706 --> 00:12:59.767
This is it.

314
00:12:59.767 --> 00:13:01.476
- If the sun moves? - Jae Yun.

315
00:13:01.476 --> 00:13:02.537
Okay, I'll run back.

316
00:13:02.537 --> 00:13:03.606
(I'll run if the queen calls me.)

317
00:13:04.147 --> 00:13:06.706
(She roasts corn elegantly.)

318
00:13:07.047 --> 00:13:08.746
(Is she all red?)

319
00:13:08.976 --> 00:13:10.616
(She has no idea and acts elegantly.)

320
00:13:10.616 --> 00:13:12.417
(Buy some nicely roasted corns.)

321
00:13:12.417 --> 00:13:14.657
(She adapts to the jungle in half a day.)

322
00:13:14.657 --> 00:13:16.157
(We have garlic too.)

323
00:13:16.887 --> 00:13:18.527
(It's a time of tribulation for the queen.)

324
00:13:18.527 --> 00:13:20.496
Gosh. It's so bitter.

325
00:13:20.996 --> 00:13:23.127
(I picked that fruit.)

326
00:13:24.167 --> 00:13:27.366
(She's busy hunting and collecting food.)

327
00:13:27.366 --> 00:13:31.466
(She gets sprayed by water.)

328
00:13:32.236 --> 00:13:35.507
(At night, she saws as well.)

329
00:13:35.507 --> 00:13:37.647
(She's losing her smile.)

330
00:13:38.177 --> 00:13:42.446
(She has to entertain the younger members, and she's exhausted.)

331
00:13:42.446 --> 00:13:46.017
(She ultimately collapses on the ground.)

332
00:13:46.017 --> 00:13:48.417
Can I have some boiled eggs and a sweet rice drink?

333
00:13:48.417 --> 00:13:49.456
(Please help me.)

334
00:13:49.456 --> 00:13:50.986
I shouldn't look like this on TV.

335
00:13:50.986 --> 00:13:52.956
(She shows her true self in the jungle.)

336
00:13:52.956 --> 00:13:54.196
I think it's great up to here.

337
00:13:55.456 --> 00:13:57.167
This is it for me in the jungle.

338
00:13:57.167 --> 00:13:58.966
(The Law of Jungle in Patagonia)

339
00:13:59.667 --> 00:14:01.566
I bought an axe last minute.

340
00:14:01.736 --> 00:14:04.307
You have to bring all the hunting tools.

341
00:14:04.307 --> 00:14:07.336
I'm trusting you to get us food.

342
00:14:07.907 --> 00:14:08.937
- You trust me? - Yes.

343
00:14:10.576 --> 00:14:13.076
You're pretty reliable. I saw you last time.

344
00:14:13.476 --> 00:14:14.616
You're reliable.

345
00:14:14.716 --> 00:14:16.076
Well...

346
00:14:16.076 --> 00:14:17.647
- Hello. - Hello.

347
00:14:17.647 --> 00:14:19.486
- Hello. - Hello. Nice to meet you.

348
00:14:19.486 --> 00:14:21.257
- Dong Jun, how have you been? - Hi, Jin Young.

349
00:14:21.257 --> 00:14:22.257
You dyed your hair.

350
00:14:22.257 --> 00:14:23.927
I did. Hello.

351
00:14:23.927 --> 00:14:25.387
- Nice to meet you. - Hello.

352
00:14:25.387 --> 00:14:26.387
(She treats them differently.)

353
00:14:26.387 --> 00:14:27.456
Goodness.

354
00:14:28.157 --> 00:14:31.627
I heard the jungle is like spicy chicken feet.

355
00:14:31.627 --> 00:14:34.566
When you eat it, it's so spicy. You don't want to eat it again,

356
00:14:34.566 --> 00:14:37.167
but later, you think about it.

357
00:14:37.167 --> 00:14:40.907
I heard it's like spicy chicken feet.

358
00:14:40.907 --> 00:14:42.437
- That sounds about right. - I agree.

359
00:14:42.437 --> 00:14:43.507
(The experienced ones approve.)

360
00:14:44.007 --> 00:14:45.007
Somebody is coming.

361
00:14:45.206 --> 00:14:46.206
Chae Yeon.

362
00:14:46.647 --> 00:14:48.047
- Chae Yeon. - Take care.

363
00:14:48.047 --> 00:14:49.047
(She's flood by flashes.)

364
00:14:49.047 --> 00:14:52.187
(Who is getting so much attention?)

365
00:14:52.187 --> 00:14:53.216
Chae Yeon.

366
00:14:53.446 --> 00:14:55.086
- Chae Yeon. - Chae Yeon.

367
00:14:56.157 --> 00:14:58.586
(JR is getting all the attention inside.)

368
00:14:58.586 --> 00:14:59.956
- Hello. - Hi.

369
00:14:59.956 --> 00:15:01.397
(They're on fire.)

370
00:15:01.826 --> 00:15:03.427
You're so pretty.

371
00:15:05.066 --> 00:15:06.667
High five?

372
00:15:07.066 --> 00:15:08.667
High five.

373
00:15:08.667 --> 00:15:09.736
Excuse us.

374
00:15:10.366 --> 00:15:12.206
There's a popular app.

375
00:15:12.206 --> 00:15:14.877
Right. I'll use it.

376
00:15:15.277 --> 00:15:18.277
You're going to miss me a lot on the plane.

377
00:15:18.277 --> 00:15:20.316
Please watch this and cry.

378
00:15:20.316 --> 00:15:22.647
I hope everybody likes you in the jungle. I love you.

379
00:15:23.147 --> 00:15:25.086
See you later.

380
00:15:25.086 --> 00:15:26.287
Let's go, jungle.

381
00:15:26.287 --> 00:15:28.856
- Chae Yeon's The Law of Jungle. - Let's go.

382
00:15:28.856 --> 00:15:31.287
- Take care. - Good luck.

383
00:15:31.287 --> 00:15:33.257
See you later. Bye.

384
00:15:33.257 --> 00:15:34.297
Good luck.

385
00:15:34.897 --> 00:15:35.956
(The dazzling idol members joins in.)

386
00:15:35.956 --> 00:15:37.326
Hello.

387
00:15:37.326 --> 00:15:39.066
- Hello. - Hello.

388
00:15:39.566 --> 00:15:41.696
(There's a big crowd.)

389
00:15:41.696 --> 00:15:42.767
Hello.

390
00:15:42.767 --> 00:15:45.537
Is it your first time seeing these members?

391
00:15:45.767 --> 00:15:48.807
- Yes. - How do you feel right now?

392
00:15:48.807 --> 00:15:50.377
Are you reassured?

393
00:15:50.377 --> 00:15:52.246
I don't know...

394
00:15:53.177 --> 00:15:54.647
Everybody is not here yet.

395
00:15:55.647 --> 00:15:58.446
You're looking forward to people who are not here yet.

396
00:15:58.887 --> 00:16:01.917
- It's not us. - It's Byung Man and Kang Nam.

397
00:16:02.316 --> 00:16:03.517
You're waiting for Kang Nam.

398
00:16:03.517 --> 00:16:04.527
(She'll feel reassured once the Chief and Kang Nam are here.)

399
00:16:04.527 --> 00:16:06.257
Nice to meet you.

400
00:16:06.257 --> 00:16:07.257
(Turning)

401
00:16:08.427 --> 00:16:09.627
- Hello. - Chief.

402
00:16:09.627 --> 00:16:11.866
If you're going to Chile, gather around me.

403
00:16:11.866 --> 00:16:12.966
- Chile. - Chile.

404
00:16:12.966 --> 00:16:14.267
- Is this a tour package? - Yes.

405
00:16:14.267 --> 00:16:15.297
I see.

406
00:16:15.297 --> 00:16:18.366
I haven't seen such a small flag.

407
00:16:19.507 --> 00:16:20.637
It was awkward for me too.

408
00:16:21.537 --> 00:16:23.877
I thought about how to show up...

409
00:16:23.877 --> 00:16:24.976
since last night.

410
00:16:25.446 --> 00:16:26.476
Really?

411
00:16:26.476 --> 00:16:29.017
Kang Nam started...

412
00:16:29.017 --> 00:16:32.017
getting sick a few days ago.

413
00:16:32.017 --> 00:16:36.687
Unfortunately, he can't join us.

414
00:16:37.456 --> 00:16:38.586
Really?

415
00:16:38.586 --> 00:16:39.657
(What happened to Kang Nam?)

416
00:16:39.657 --> 00:16:40.897
He's not going?

417
00:16:42.297 --> 00:16:44.297
(He has the flu, so he can't come.)

418
00:16:45.397 --> 00:16:47.836
- Is this the whole team? - Is it?

419
00:16:47.836 --> 00:16:51.336
It's better than getting sick while he's there.

420
00:16:51.336 --> 00:16:53.137
Health is of utmost importance.

421
00:16:53.137 --> 00:16:55.307
We'll be on our way.

422
00:16:55.307 --> 00:16:56.537
You'll take over Kang Nam's roles.

423
00:16:57.007 --> 00:16:58.346
I'll try my best.

424
00:16:58.346 --> 00:17:01.917
Before we go in, I have snacks for everybody.

425
00:17:02.716 --> 00:17:05.317
(She takes something out.)

426
00:17:05.317 --> 00:17:06.887
(She prepared something for Byung Man's Tribe.)

427
00:17:06.887 --> 00:17:08.556
- Hold on. What's this? - Thank you.

428
00:17:08.917 --> 00:17:09.986
This is...

429
00:17:09.986 --> 00:17:11.087
- Can we drink it now? - It's really good.

430
00:17:11.087 --> 00:17:12.286
- Yes. - I drink this too.

431
00:17:12.286 --> 00:17:13.486
It's like a snack.

432
00:17:13.486 --> 00:17:15.427
I put this in my bag...

433
00:17:15.427 --> 00:17:17.327
- and drink it while I'm outside. - Instead of eating food?

434
00:17:17.327 --> 00:17:18.667
- Yes. - This is filling.

435
00:17:18.667 --> 00:17:19.996
I didn't eat anything.

436
00:17:20.236 --> 00:17:21.696
This is filling.

437
00:17:21.796 --> 00:17:23.097
This is a lot.

438
00:17:23.466 --> 00:17:25.137
I should get some.

439
00:17:25.137 --> 00:17:26.167
This is good.

440
00:17:26.976 --> 00:17:29.506
It's time to travel to the other side of the world.

441
00:17:29.607 --> 00:17:30.946
Let's do a cheer for The Law of Jungle in Patagonia...

442
00:17:30.946 --> 00:17:32.847
- before we leave. - Okay.

443
00:17:32.877 --> 00:17:34.417
The Law of Jungle in Patagonia.

444
00:17:34.417 --> 00:17:35.617
- Let's go. - Let's go.

445
00:17:36.276 --> 00:17:37.716
(How will they survive and conquer the end of the world?)

446
00:17:37.716 --> 00:17:38.786
I'm excited.

447
00:17:41.357 --> 00:17:44.887
(They have a long flight ahead.)

448
00:17:44.887 --> 00:17:45.956
I'm nervous.

449
00:17:46.627 --> 00:17:49.927
(They're returning to the jungle after a long time.)

450
00:17:49.927 --> 00:17:52.696
(The rookies are excited as well.)

451
00:17:53.867 --> 00:17:57.006
(Farewell, Korea.)

452
00:17:59.437 --> 00:18:02.006
From Seoul to Patagonia, Chile,

453
00:18:02.006 --> 00:18:06.046
the distance is 20,841km.

454
00:18:06.677 --> 00:18:10.817
It takes over 40 hours on land, sea, and air.

455
00:18:11.016 --> 00:18:14.357
The road to the farthest destination ever on the show...

456
00:18:14.357 --> 00:18:16.956
has finally begun.

457
00:18:19.657 --> 00:18:22.996
(How they spend time on board)

458
00:18:24.226 --> 00:18:30.667
(They read books or watch cartoons instead of using their phones.)

459
00:18:30.667 --> 00:18:34.506
(Some play classic games.)

460
00:18:34.506 --> 00:18:37.077
- I pick 9. - 9? That's too bad.

461
00:18:37.077 --> 00:18:38.306
- Never mind. - This is not good.

462
00:18:38.907 --> 00:18:41.817
(Some people catch up on sleep.)

463
00:18:41.817 --> 00:18:44.687
(Still, time crawls while they're on board.)

464
00:18:44.687 --> 00:18:48.486
(Jin Young is busy while everybody's asleep.)

465
00:18:48.486 --> 00:18:50.117
(What are you doing?)

466
00:18:51.427 --> 00:18:53.927
Elevate. Elevate my face.

467
00:18:54.026 --> 00:18:55.726
Take the swelling away.

468
00:18:56.256 --> 00:18:59.466
(She's doing it to take the swelling away.)

469
00:18:59.466 --> 00:19:00.696
It's so interesting.

470
00:19:00.837 --> 00:19:02.296
- You find it interesting? - Yes.

471
00:19:02.897 --> 00:19:04.466
(It's Jin Young's on-board beauty shop.)

472
00:19:04.466 --> 00:19:06.137
- Isn't it good? - I love stuff like this.

473
00:19:06.137 --> 00:19:08.407
Really? It slims your face.

474
00:19:08.706 --> 00:19:10.847
It adds elasticity and takes the swelling away.

475
00:19:10.847 --> 00:19:11.946
(He was watching and got drawn into it.)

476
00:19:11.946 --> 00:19:13.206
Let's see. Look at me.

477
00:19:15.077 --> 00:19:17.817
- His face got slim. Look. - Already?

478
00:19:17.817 --> 00:19:18.817
(They're not bored because they're together.)

479
00:19:18.817 --> 00:19:20.147
(It's snowy in Toronto International Airport.)

480
00:19:20.147 --> 00:19:21.357
It's snowy.

481
00:19:22.716 --> 00:19:23.786
We're in Canada.

482
00:19:23.786 --> 00:19:25.127
Isn't that halfway?

483
00:19:25.127 --> 00:19:26.187
We are halfway.

484
00:19:26.187 --> 00:19:29.427
In 7 hours, we have to get on a flight for 12 hours.

485
00:19:29.427 --> 00:19:31.327
That means we have 19 hours left, right?

486
00:19:31.327 --> 00:19:33.367
We have to...

487
00:19:33.367 --> 00:19:35.496
go for 19 more hours...

488
00:19:35.496 --> 00:19:36.867
and wait.

489
00:19:38.536 --> 00:19:41.877
It's been 22 hours since we started filming.

490
00:19:43.236 --> 00:19:44.577
(The camera was on for a full day.)

491
00:19:44.577 --> 00:19:46.546
It's been 22 hours since we started.

492
00:19:47.347 --> 00:19:49.417
I think that's enough for a week's worth of episode.

493
00:19:50.117 --> 00:19:51.147
Hello.

494
00:19:51.486 --> 00:19:53.387
(Who is that?)

495
00:19:53.587 --> 00:19:56.087
(Who are they...)

496
00:19:56.087 --> 00:19:58.786
(so glad to meet?)

497
00:19:59.127 --> 00:20:00.187
(He shows himself.)

498
00:20:01.657 --> 00:20:03.296
(He looks handsome just from the silhouette.)

499
00:20:03.927 --> 00:20:04.927
- It's Min Hyuk. - Hello.

500
00:20:05.827 --> 00:20:08.437
(Monsta X is gaining popularity with "Dramarama".)

501
00:20:08.437 --> 00:20:11.137
(Min Hyuk is the group's vocalist and a handsome member.)

502
00:20:11.137 --> 00:20:13.536
(He is also great at being an MC.)

503
00:20:15.177 --> 00:20:16.806
It's Monsta X. Congratulations.

504
00:20:16.806 --> 00:20:19.276
(They recently got 1st place in a music show.)

505
00:20:19.276 --> 00:20:20.276
(I got an emergency call from The Law of Jungle?)

506
00:20:20.276 --> 00:20:21.446
Congratulations.

507
00:20:21.446 --> 00:20:23.117
I didn't know somebody would show up like this.

508
00:20:23.117 --> 00:20:25.847
He was given a very short notice.

509
00:20:25.847 --> 00:20:26.887
- Really? - Thanks for coming.

510
00:20:27.986 --> 00:20:30.117
How did you come so suddenly?

511
00:20:30.117 --> 00:20:32.687
I was sleeping at home.

512
00:20:33.157 --> 00:20:35.327
I got a call, and they said I have to leave for the jungle,

513
00:20:35.327 --> 00:20:37.067
so I just said yes.

514
00:20:37.067 --> 00:20:38.296
I thought I had a few days.

515
00:20:38.296 --> 00:20:39.667
I just said yes.

516
00:20:39.927 --> 00:20:41.437
I asked when it was and they said it was now.

517
00:20:41.437 --> 00:20:43.067
I said "What?" and then I got up...

518
00:20:43.067 --> 00:20:44.706
and took a taxi.

519
00:20:45.137 --> 00:20:46.667
Do you know where we are going?

520
00:20:46.806 --> 00:20:48.536
I heard it was somewhere cold, so I wore a jacket.

521
00:20:48.736 --> 00:20:50.546
Somewhere cold? "Are we going somewhere cold?"

522
00:20:51.746 --> 00:20:55.716
Kang Nam is sick, so I was getting worried,

523
00:20:55.946 --> 00:20:57.516
but I feel energized again.

524
00:20:57.986 --> 00:21:00.216
- Welcome, Min Hyuk. - Thank you.

525
00:21:00.216 --> 00:21:01.417
(We welcome you very much, Min Hyuk.)

526
00:21:01.617 --> 00:21:03.417
(Please do Kang Nam's share.)

527
00:21:04.226 --> 00:21:05.327
Are we leaving?

528
00:21:05.327 --> 00:21:06.756
(They get on a plane to Santiago.)

529
00:21:09.097 --> 00:21:11.597
(However,)

530
00:21:11.597 --> 00:21:16.567
(the passengers come back out.)

531
00:21:16.567 --> 00:21:20.437
(Byung Man's Tribe comes back out looking tired.)

532
00:21:24.177 --> 00:21:25.206
Sorry.

533
00:21:25.206 --> 00:21:27.147
There are so many fire trucks here.

534
00:21:27.516 --> 00:21:29.216
- What's wrong? - It must be an emergency.

535
00:21:29.216 --> 00:21:31.087
(The firemen move about busily.)

536
00:21:32.546 --> 00:21:33.956
(They're dejected.)

537
00:21:33.956 --> 00:21:35.187
We might take the longest...

538
00:21:35.187 --> 00:21:38.226
to arrive at our destination.

539
00:21:38.226 --> 00:21:40.526
(What's happening at Toronto International Airport?)

540
00:21:42.296 --> 00:21:45.266
In January, extreme cold hit North America.

541
00:21:45.567 --> 00:21:48.837
The runway in Toronto airport froze,

542
00:21:48.837 --> 00:21:50.806
so over 500 flights were...

543
00:21:50.806 --> 00:21:52.736
either cancelled or delayed.

544
00:21:53.706 --> 00:21:57.877
The airport is in chaos with passengers who are waiting indefinitely.

545
00:22:00.716 --> 00:22:02.877
It's a mission itself to get to our destination.

546
00:22:02.976 --> 00:22:04.387
Gosh.

547
00:22:04.387 --> 00:22:08.056
(They have to wait 5 more hours to board the flight.)

548
00:22:08.056 --> 00:22:10.687
I got impatient,

549
00:22:10.927 --> 00:22:14.627
nervous, and felt more fatigue.

550
00:22:17.067 --> 00:22:20.736
I got worried. We don't know when the ice is going to melt.

551
00:22:21.137 --> 00:22:24.167
I thought we might not make it to the jungle.

552
00:22:24.167 --> 00:22:25.266
(What if we can't get to the jungle?)

553
00:22:25.266 --> 00:22:27.736
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't worried.

554
00:22:27.736 --> 00:22:30.276
From the seven years of experience I had,

555
00:22:30.347 --> 00:22:32.706
this is just a small hurdle.

556
00:22:32.976 --> 00:22:34.976
I was hoping for a good result.

557
00:22:35.117 --> 00:22:36.147
(The Chief waited and prayed inside.)

558
00:22:36.147 --> 00:22:37.246
I had to believe it.

559
00:22:38.986 --> 00:22:41.087
(The runway is back in function 7 hours later.)

560
00:22:43.357 --> 00:22:45.927
(Byung Man's Tribe finally gets on.)

561
00:22:47.327 --> 00:22:49.226
(They get ready to take off.)

562
00:22:51.567 --> 00:22:53.127
(After a long wait,)

563
00:22:53.127 --> 00:22:54.637
(the plane takes off.)

564
00:22:54.637 --> 00:22:58.036
After some problems, they arrive in Santiago...

565
00:22:58.036 --> 00:23:00.736
and head south to their final destination.

566
00:23:02.337 --> 00:23:05.306
We left Seoul and we've been in the air the whole time.

567
00:23:05.306 --> 00:23:08.046
I've never been on so many airplanes in my life.

568
00:23:08.476 --> 00:23:11.917
It's a long road that takes 40 hours to arrive at their destination.

569
00:23:12.216 --> 00:23:15.286
It's the longest journey ever to be travelled on the show.

570
00:23:15.286 --> 00:23:18.327
Byung Man's Tribe is headed to...

571
00:23:18.327 --> 00:23:19.887
Patagonia, Chile which is in South America.

572
00:23:20.187 --> 00:23:24.266
It's 20,841km from Seoul.

573
00:23:24.726 --> 00:23:28.867
Chile is the farthest country from Korea...

574
00:23:28.867 --> 00:23:31.667
and the longest country in the world.

575
00:23:32.137 --> 00:23:35.706
Patagonia originated from the Patagones,

576
00:23:35.706 --> 00:23:38.046
and it means "big feet".

577
00:23:38.347 --> 00:23:42.317
The explorer Ferdinand Magellan discovered the land in 16th century,

578
00:23:42.317 --> 00:23:44.587
and saw the big footprints...

579
00:23:44.587 --> 00:23:48.256
that were left by the natives and called it "The Land of Big Feet".

580
00:23:48.657 --> 00:23:51.756
The 35th Byung Man's Tribe has a big task to complete.

581
00:23:52.127 --> 00:23:56.127
A project to conquer the end of the earth.

582
00:23:56.456 --> 00:23:59.067
Traverse Patagonia of Chile.

583
00:23:59.067 --> 00:24:02.567
(Traverse Patagonia of Chile.)

584
00:24:05.337 --> 00:24:06.877
(Welcome to Chile.)

585
00:24:09.536 --> 00:24:11.347
I had a picture in mind.

586
00:24:11.347 --> 00:24:13.577
- How many people can get on? Four? - You can come in.

587
00:24:21.216 --> 00:24:22.917
We're getting started right away.

588
00:24:22.917 --> 00:24:24.226
We're getting started.

589
00:24:24.226 --> 00:24:26.226
(They divide into 3 cars and move south.)

590
00:24:26.226 --> 00:24:28.157
- Cameraman. - Yes?

591
00:24:28.157 --> 00:24:29.427
You can take a break.

592
00:24:29.427 --> 00:24:30.667
(They're all tired, so they look after each other.)

593
00:24:30.667 --> 00:24:32.196
- Okay. - Take a break.

594
00:24:32.296 --> 00:24:33.296
Okay.

595
00:24:34.296 --> 00:24:36.296
Doesn't it feel like we got away from the society?

596
00:24:36.397 --> 00:24:38.137
I didn't want to get away from it.

597
00:24:40.006 --> 00:24:41.407
Good bye

598
00:24:41.407 --> 00:24:43.306
(They try to feel less tired by singing.)

599
00:24:44.877 --> 00:24:46.806
(Meanwhile,)

600
00:24:46.976 --> 00:24:50.417
(they're only thinking about the survival.)

601
00:24:50.546 --> 00:24:53.016
(They're too serious.)

602
00:24:55.587 --> 00:24:57.587
People on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd car.

603
00:24:58.657 --> 00:25:00.026
(Jin Young speaks into the walkie-talkie.)

604
00:25:00.026 --> 00:25:01.296
On the way,

605
00:25:01.296 --> 00:25:03.996
I saw cows...

606
00:25:03.996 --> 00:25:05.397
on the empty plain.

607
00:25:05.397 --> 00:25:07.266
It feels like we're on a field trip.

608
00:25:07.266 --> 00:25:09.837
Let's sing together.

609
00:25:09.837 --> 00:25:13.577
1 is 1, not 2

610
00:25:13.577 --> 00:25:15.377
- Speak into it. - 5, 6, 7, 8.

611
00:25:15.377 --> 00:25:19.006
1 is 1, not 2

612
00:25:19.246 --> 00:25:22.847
2 is 2, not 3

613
00:25:23.516 --> 00:25:26.417
- Good job. - Let's test...

614
00:25:26.647 --> 00:25:29.956
how long Jin Young's energy will lasts.

615
00:25:29.956 --> 00:25:31.756
I'll test you.

616
00:25:32.556 --> 00:25:35.597
Help me, Byung Man. I'm next to her.

617
00:25:37.466 --> 00:25:39.067
(They are entertained by Jin Young.)

618
00:25:39.067 --> 00:25:42.667
Let's follow the sound

619
00:25:42.667 --> 00:25:46.266
- Of the echo of the water - Of the echo of the water

620
00:25:46.266 --> 00:25:52.077
- Let's go on a trip - Let's go on a trip

621
00:25:52.077 --> 00:25:53.147
(They keep driving.)

622
00:25:53.246 --> 00:25:55.077
Look. Why is that purple?

623
00:25:55.776 --> 00:25:56.817
I don't know.

624
00:25:57.617 --> 00:25:59.917
- It's so distinct. - It's a rainbow.

625
00:25:59.917 --> 00:26:00.956
(They're awed by the sights they've never seen before.)

626
00:26:00.956 --> 00:26:03.286
(A rainbow?)

627
00:26:04.387 --> 00:26:05.927
I can see it clearly.

628
00:26:05.927 --> 00:26:07.296
(A rainbow appears.)

629
00:26:07.296 --> 00:26:08.657
Isn't that a rainbow?

630
00:26:09.196 --> 00:26:11.167
We looked out the window,

631
00:26:11.466 --> 00:26:13.067
and there were so many countries.

632
00:26:13.067 --> 00:26:14.996
We were in Chile,

633
00:26:14.996 --> 00:26:18.466
but it felt like we were in the Alps.

634
00:26:18.706 --> 00:26:20.736
Chile is a beautiful country.

635
00:26:21.377 --> 00:26:22.377
I know.

636
00:26:23.306 --> 00:26:25.647
(The primitive nature turns them into boys.)

637
00:26:25.847 --> 00:26:27.046
It's like a painting.

638
00:26:27.046 --> 00:26:28.417
(They enjoy the painting by the nature.)

639
00:26:28.417 --> 00:26:31.716
The end of the earth sure is different.

640
00:26:32.647 --> 00:26:34.516
It's mysterious.

641
00:26:34.817 --> 00:26:36.716
It's like a painting.

642
00:26:36.817 --> 00:26:38.627
It rains like a painting.

643
00:26:38.627 --> 00:26:39.887
(It rains like a watercolour painting.)

644
00:26:42.327 --> 00:26:44.567
It's raining.

645
00:26:44.567 --> 00:26:45.567
(The rain thickens.)

646
00:26:46.496 --> 00:26:50.097
If it rains a lot at our survival zone,

647
00:26:50.706 --> 00:26:53.167
it will be hard.

648
00:26:53.167 --> 00:26:54.536
I hope the rain stops.

649
00:26:54.536 --> 00:26:58.746
I think it rains multiple times a day in this area.

650
00:26:58.746 --> 00:26:59.806
(The weather worsens as they reach their destination.)

651
00:26:59.806 --> 00:27:01.516
It's not necessarily a terrible weather.

652
00:27:02.147 --> 00:27:04.587
- The weather is... - It's raining.

653
00:27:04.587 --> 00:27:07.486
The temperature is lower than I expected.

654
00:27:07.486 --> 00:27:09.157
- That's right. - It's really windy.

655
00:27:09.357 --> 00:27:12.327
I have felt this kind of weather...

656
00:27:12.327 --> 00:27:14.357
on my fourth trip of the show.

657
00:27:14.357 --> 00:27:16.397
The weather was exactly like this in Siberia.

658
00:27:16.726 --> 00:27:21.067
Six years ago, Chief Byung Man had to fight against the cold.

659
00:27:21.296 --> 00:27:24.236
Surviving in the cold was difficult.

660
00:27:24.236 --> 00:27:26.567
We first need to find a shelter...

661
00:27:27.536 --> 00:27:30.407
we can sleep for a night.

662
00:27:30.407 --> 00:27:32.647
- Shall we go? - Let's get going.

663
00:27:32.677 --> 00:27:33.976
Let's go.

664
00:27:34.117 --> 00:27:35.246
- All right. - Let's go.

665
00:27:35.246 --> 00:27:36.617
- Let's go. - Let's go.

666
00:27:37.046 --> 00:27:39.317
Shouldn't we look for dry leaves?

667
00:27:39.317 --> 00:27:41.887
- We can collect them as we go. - We need kindling.

668
00:27:42.056 --> 00:27:43.986
This will catch on fire easily.

669
00:27:44.026 --> 00:27:47.397
We need dry wood. This is great.

670
00:27:47.397 --> 00:27:49.026
This is a pine tree.

671
00:27:49.327 --> 00:27:52.167
This is great.

672
00:27:52.167 --> 00:27:54.036
- There are a lot of those branches. - There are a lot further inside.

673
00:27:54.837 --> 00:27:55.837
This is...

674
00:27:55.837 --> 00:27:57.536
(With his experiences, Seung Soo leads the team gently.)

675
00:27:57.536 --> 00:27:59.036
This is dry.

676
00:28:01.706 --> 00:28:02.907
It will catch on fire.

677
00:28:02.907 --> 00:28:04.647
(Jin Young joins in.)

678
00:28:04.647 --> 00:28:06.347
It's so cold right now.

679
00:28:06.347 --> 00:28:07.446
(The cold stimulates her survival instinct.)

680
00:28:09.377 --> 00:28:10.446
(Looking around)

681
00:28:10.446 --> 00:28:11.446
(What did Chae Yeon find?)

682
00:28:11.446 --> 00:28:12.486
There is a lot.

683
00:28:12.486 --> 00:28:13.617
All right.

684
00:28:15.187 --> 00:28:16.817
- This is incredible. - I know.

685
00:28:16.817 --> 00:28:18.657
This is the giving tree.

686
00:28:19.427 --> 00:28:21.627
This is the giving tree.

687
00:28:21.627 --> 00:28:22.827
(Fuzz like an old man's beard covers the tree trunk.)

688
00:28:22.827 --> 00:28:24.726
- This is incredible. - This is great.

689
00:28:24.726 --> 00:28:25.796
(Fuzz like an old man's beard covers the tree trunk.)

690
00:28:27.236 --> 00:28:28.236
You have good eyes.

691
00:28:28.897 --> 00:28:30.806
This is great.

692
00:28:30.806 --> 00:28:32.536
(Florida beard lichen is an epiphyte that is similar to moss.)

693
00:28:32.536 --> 00:28:33.837
I got this much.

694
00:28:34.006 --> 00:28:35.006
We were lucky.

695
00:28:35.006 --> 00:28:36.006
(Its flammability makes it useful for building a fire.)

696
00:28:36.637 --> 00:28:38.706
It looks like green onion roots.

697
00:28:39.647 --> 00:28:41.446
(Let's build a fire.)

698
00:28:42.647 --> 00:28:44.546
We need to find a place to sleep.

699
00:28:45.286 --> 00:28:46.286
We need to find a place to sleep.

700
00:28:46.286 --> 00:28:47.857
- This is it, right? - Yes.

701
00:28:48.587 --> 00:28:51.986
Hold on. I don't think we should leave the forest.

702
00:28:52.056 --> 00:28:54.597
My goodness. Hold on.

703
00:28:54.796 --> 00:28:56.026
Go out there.

704
00:28:56.026 --> 00:28:57.327
(The wind is strong outside of the forest.)

705
00:28:57.327 --> 00:28:58.427
Go out there.

706
00:28:58.427 --> 00:28:59.726
- My goodness. - Hold on.

707
00:28:59.726 --> 00:29:01.397
- I think... - This is...

708
00:29:01.397 --> 00:29:02.397
My goodness.

709
00:29:02.397 --> 00:29:04.137
Dong Jun, here is what I think.

710
00:29:04.536 --> 00:29:05.837
Look over there.

711
00:29:06.036 --> 00:29:08.837
The wind is blowing in this direction.

712
00:29:08.837 --> 00:29:10.446
I think it will be cosy there.

713
00:29:10.446 --> 00:29:12.107
- Shall we go? - Let's go.

714
00:29:12.706 --> 00:29:14.377
I could be wrong. Let me say that in advance.

715
00:29:14.377 --> 00:29:15.817
- It's cold. - It's so cold.

716
00:29:15.817 --> 00:29:17.016
(Wide and flat land stretches out beneath the snow-capped mountain.)

717
00:29:19.446 --> 00:29:21.056
You are at...

718
00:29:21.216 --> 00:29:22.917
Patagonia.

719
00:29:22.917 --> 00:29:24.456
- Patagonia. - Patagonia.

720
00:29:24.456 --> 00:29:29.026
I never thought I would sleep at Patagonia.

721
00:29:29.127 --> 00:29:34.996
This isn't your place of survival.

722
00:29:35.097 --> 00:29:37.266
What do you see behind you?

723
00:29:37.266 --> 00:29:38.907
(Behind them...)

724
00:29:38.907 --> 00:29:39.907
(is a snow-capped mountain.)

725
00:29:39.907 --> 00:29:42.006
- A snow-capped mountain. - A snow-capped mountain.

726
00:29:42.006 --> 00:29:43.006
No way.

727
00:29:44.006 --> 00:29:46.917
(They become anxious and apprehensive.)

728
00:29:46.917 --> 00:29:51.417
Beyond the snow-capped mountain is your place of survival.

729
00:29:51.417 --> 00:29:52.546
We need to cross the mountain?

730
00:29:52.546 --> 00:29:55.286
(Do they need to cross the snow-capped mountain?)

731
00:29:55.556 --> 00:29:56.817
- Do we need to cross it? - Are you serious?

732
00:29:58.587 --> 00:30:02.196
This is the project to conquer the end of the earth.

733
00:30:02.526 --> 00:30:05.466
Their first journey starts at Patagonia in the south of Chile.

734
00:30:05.466 --> 00:30:07.036
(Patagonia in the south of Chile)

735
00:30:07.036 --> 00:30:09.397
This is the last stop before the South Pole.

736
00:30:09.536 --> 00:30:11.367
It's called the end of the earth.

737
00:30:13.367 --> 00:30:15.407
The lowest temperature is minus 20°C.

738
00:30:15.806 --> 00:30:18.546
The cold glacial water that comes from the snow-capped mountain...

739
00:30:18.546 --> 00:30:22.677
gives Chief Byung Man an environment he has never experienced.

740
00:30:22.677 --> 00:30:24.317
(Chief Byung Man hasn't experienced this kind of water temperature.)

741
00:30:24.317 --> 00:30:25.946
If your body temperature drops by 4°C,

742
00:30:26.317 --> 00:30:27.317
you are at risk of hypothermia.

743
00:30:28.157 --> 00:30:30.256
In the land of rainstorms,

744
00:30:30.687 --> 00:30:33.157
they must brave the biting wind...

745
00:30:33.526 --> 00:30:35.657
and the deadly cold.

746
00:30:35.657 --> 00:30:36.657
It's cold.

747
00:30:37.026 --> 00:30:40.736
The indigenous people of Patagonia...

748
00:30:41.296 --> 00:30:45.637
used leather and fur of animals to survive in the cold.

749
00:30:47.476 --> 00:30:50.306
To survive in the extreme cold,

750
00:30:50.476 --> 00:30:52.806
they need to come up with the means to fight the cold.

751
00:30:53.647 --> 00:30:57.786
Will Byung Man's Tribe be able to win against the cold?

752
00:30:58.446 --> 00:31:00.986
I didn't think the conditions would be this poor.

753
00:31:01.456 --> 00:31:03.157
Will we be able to sleep here?

754
00:31:04.056 --> 00:31:05.827
We need to decide on a place to sleep.

755
00:31:05.827 --> 00:31:08.496
We could really die in the cold.

756
00:31:09.226 --> 00:31:11.597
Inside the forest...

757
00:31:11.927 --> 00:31:13.026
is wet.

758
00:31:13.327 --> 00:31:15.597
- Inside the forest? - Yes, the ground is wet.

759
00:31:15.937 --> 00:31:16.937
Thus...

760
00:31:17.637 --> 00:31:20.806
(Chief Byung Man thinks harder than ever.)

761
00:31:20.806 --> 00:31:22.907
(Give us an order.)

762
00:31:23.946 --> 00:31:26.877
Let's take care of what we need the most.

763
00:31:26.946 --> 00:31:30.647
Let's drag logs here for firewood.

764
00:31:31.546 --> 00:31:33.046
(Jin Young charges her battery.)

765
00:31:33.046 --> 00:31:36.117
We need as many thick logs as we can find.

766
00:31:36.117 --> 00:31:37.587
(She acts within a second.)

767
00:31:37.726 --> 00:31:39.056
(What was that?)

768
00:31:40.056 --> 00:31:42.456
(Jin Young marches forward.)

769
00:31:43.526 --> 00:31:44.996
(This is Jin Young's power.)

770
00:31:47.367 --> 00:31:48.667
(She is ready to jump into the water.)

771
00:31:48.667 --> 00:31:49.696
Don't get those logs.

772
00:31:50.167 --> 00:31:52.607
We need the ones in the forest.

773
00:31:52.907 --> 00:31:54.437
There is firewood.

774
00:31:54.437 --> 00:31:55.637
(In that case)

775
00:31:55.637 --> 00:31:58.246
(Jin Young marches in the opposite direction.)

776
00:31:58.246 --> 00:31:59.907
(She is powerful.)

777
00:32:00.347 --> 00:32:01.377
Did you see that?

778
00:32:01.716 --> 00:32:03.147
(She pants...)

779
00:32:03.147 --> 00:32:06.647
(and runs towards the target.)

780
00:32:06.647 --> 00:32:07.857
(Heave-ho)

781
00:32:08.157 --> 00:32:10.256
Do we need dry wood?

782
00:32:10.486 --> 00:32:12.927
- What? - What kind of firewood do we need?

783
00:32:13.427 --> 00:32:14.857
They need these branches.

784
00:32:17.127 --> 00:32:18.226
Okay.

785
00:32:19.427 --> 00:32:20.437
All right.

786
00:32:21.536 --> 00:32:23.137
All right.

787
00:32:24.107 --> 00:32:26.067
- Which one? - The one in the middle.

788
00:32:26.367 --> 00:32:28.236
- Which one? - I will give it another go.

789
00:32:28.236 --> 00:32:30.206
(Jin Young's touchdown)

790
00:32:30.206 --> 00:32:31.907
- All right. - That one?

791
00:32:34.577 --> 00:32:36.016
(Jin Young is about to explode.)

792
00:32:36.177 --> 00:32:37.246
Don't do that.

793
00:32:38.516 --> 00:32:39.647
Hold on. Let's pull it together.

794
00:32:39.647 --> 00:32:41.357
Let's put our hands over here.

795
00:32:41.357 --> 00:32:43.016
(They work as one.)

796
00:32:43.016 --> 00:32:44.127
In 1, 2, 3.

797
00:32:44.657 --> 00:32:45.726
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

798
00:32:45.827 --> 00:32:46.827
We did it.

799
00:32:47.627 --> 00:32:49.196
- Let's go. - Let's take these branches too.

800
00:32:49.196 --> 00:32:51.327
(They take the smaller branches.)

801
00:32:52.696 --> 00:32:55.167
I feel less cold now that my body is heated up.

802
00:32:55.167 --> 00:32:56.196
It's better.

803
00:32:56.397 --> 00:32:58.907
- Let's gather firewood... - Yes.

804
00:32:58.907 --> 00:33:00.036
and take it over there.

805
00:33:01.437 --> 00:33:04.407
(The logs are pretty big.)

806
00:33:04.847 --> 00:33:06.806
- This is heavy. - Will you be able to lift it up?

807
00:33:06.806 --> 00:33:08.077
Let's lift it up together.

808
00:33:08.377 --> 00:33:09.946
- Let's lift it up together. - Let's go.

809
00:33:10.147 --> 00:33:11.187
(Seung Soo joins them in an instant.)

810
00:33:11.187 --> 00:33:13.016
- Let's lift it up together. - Which way are you going?

811
00:33:13.016 --> 00:33:14.256
Go in front of me.

812
00:33:14.857 --> 00:33:16.516
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

813
00:33:16.516 --> 00:33:18.887
(Under Chief Byung Man's command,)

814
00:33:18.887 --> 00:33:19.887
(they move as one.)

815
00:33:19.887 --> 00:33:22.026
- Dong Jun, take the lead. - Okay.

816
00:33:23.157 --> 00:33:24.226
That branch is coming along.

817
00:33:24.226 --> 00:33:25.627
(It's a bonus.)

818
00:33:25.627 --> 00:33:26.627
Dong Jun, take the lead.

819
00:33:26.627 --> 00:33:27.796
(Dong Jun takes the lead.)

820
00:33:27.796 --> 00:33:28.837
Dong Jun, take the lead.

821
00:33:28.837 --> 00:33:30.407
(He is forced to take the lead.)

822
00:33:31.306 --> 00:33:34.937
We won't be able to burn the log by tomorrow.

823
00:33:36.036 --> 00:33:37.046
(Screaming)

824
00:33:37.046 --> 00:33:39.446
- It's heavy. - It's so heavy.

825
00:33:40.046 --> 00:33:42.216
- It's going down. - Put it down.

826
00:33:42.216 --> 00:33:43.377
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

827
00:33:45.647 --> 00:33:47.687
- Gosh, it's so cold. - Where should I put firewood?

828
00:33:47.687 --> 00:33:49.157
- Put it here. - Here?

829
00:33:49.286 --> 00:33:50.327
Let's go.

830
00:33:52.357 --> 00:33:54.996
(One hour passes since their arrival)

831
00:33:55.226 --> 00:33:56.427
(The temperature goes down and the wind grows stronger.)

832
00:33:56.427 --> 00:33:58.167
(They need to build a fire soon.)

833
00:33:58.167 --> 00:33:59.996
Who has the kindling?

834
00:34:00.996 --> 00:34:02.196
Chae Yeon had it in her pocket.

835
00:34:02.196 --> 00:34:03.736
- Here it is. - Really?

836
00:34:03.907 --> 00:34:04.937
Now...

837
00:34:05.367 --> 00:34:07.736
We need to build a fire.

838
00:34:07.736 --> 00:34:09.937
- Now... - There is a lot.

839
00:34:09.937 --> 00:34:11.107
Let's put it here.

840
00:34:12.346 --> 00:34:16.447
(Chae Yeon put her back into collecting...)

841
00:34:16.447 --> 00:34:21.187
(the epiphyte the indigenous people used as a kindling.)

842
00:34:23.516 --> 00:34:25.757
Let's dig a hole to keep the wind out.

843
00:34:26.286 --> 00:34:27.556
Will it keep the wind out?

844
00:34:27.627 --> 00:34:28.656
(Dig a hole to keep the fire safe from the wind.)

845
00:34:28.656 --> 00:34:29.656
Here.

846
00:34:30.567 --> 00:34:33.167
It will keep the wind out.

847
00:34:33.636 --> 00:34:34.897
I will cut it.

848
00:34:36.366 --> 00:34:37.906
It needs to be cut.

849
00:34:37.906 --> 00:34:41.676
(He uses the fire steel to make flint dust.)

850
00:34:42.837 --> 00:34:45.107
JR, you need to blow on it.

851
00:34:45.746 --> 00:34:47.917
Bring these leaves closer.

852
00:34:49.547 --> 00:34:50.547
That's right.

853
00:34:52.217 --> 00:34:55.056
(Chae Yeon follows Dong Jun's lead and works her knife.)

854
00:34:55.056 --> 00:34:56.056
That's good.

855
00:34:56.357 --> 00:34:57.857
(It looks like they are close.)

856
00:34:57.857 --> 00:34:59.786
(They continue to see the spark.)

857
00:35:02.127 --> 00:35:03.667
It's not working.

858
00:35:03.926 --> 00:35:04.926
Be careful.

859
00:35:05.397 --> 00:35:09.567
(There is enough spark.)

860
00:35:09.567 --> 00:35:11.107
It's too windy.

861
00:35:11.107 --> 00:35:12.136
(Discouraged)

862
00:35:13.266 --> 00:35:15.306
It's too windy.

863
00:35:15.306 --> 00:35:16.306
(The strong wind of Patagonia snuffs out the flame.)

864
00:35:17.947 --> 00:35:18.947
All right.

865
00:35:18.947 --> 00:35:20.447
(They try harder.)

866
00:35:20.447 --> 00:35:21.676
A little bit more.

867
00:35:23.317 --> 00:35:24.386
A little bit more.

868
00:35:24.386 --> 00:35:26.547
(The spark is stronger.)

869
00:35:26.547 --> 00:35:29.487
Come on.

870
00:35:29.487 --> 00:35:31.156
(She does it recklessly.)

871
00:35:32.087 --> 00:35:33.156
I see the smoke.

872
00:35:34.426 --> 00:35:37.197
There is a spark, but it won't transfer.

873
00:35:37.926 --> 00:35:39.627
I think it's a bit wet.

874
00:35:39.726 --> 00:35:41.266
Touch it.

875
00:35:41.996 --> 00:35:45.607
I touched it with bare hands. I think it's a bit wet.

876
00:35:45.636 --> 00:35:48.337
I will find something that's not wet.

877
00:35:48.837 --> 00:35:49.837
(They decide to get more items.)

878
00:35:49.837 --> 00:35:50.846
My goodness.

879
00:35:52.107 --> 00:35:53.176
It's wet.

880
00:35:53.306 --> 00:35:54.377
Seriously.

881
00:35:54.377 --> 00:35:55.447
(They need to build a fire before the sun sets.)

882
00:35:56.447 --> 00:36:02.056
(He divides the tasks among the Tribe members.)

883
00:36:02.056 --> 00:36:04.487
(He doesn't jump into building the house.)

884
00:36:04.487 --> 00:36:07.757
The wind was blowing and reducing our body heat.

885
00:36:08.426 --> 00:36:12.197
It was so cold. I had a lot of thoughts.

886
00:36:12.467 --> 00:36:15.697
"Which material should I use? Where should I build the house?"

887
00:36:16.737 --> 00:36:19.437
I was nervous.

888
00:36:22.107 --> 00:36:26.246
I won't build a wall with the wood to stop the wind.

889
00:36:27.116 --> 00:36:30.547
I learned this during a survival training.

890
00:36:30.547 --> 00:36:33.987
When the temperature dropped below 0°C,

891
00:36:34.386 --> 00:36:37.456
I made a circle with this.

892
00:36:38.056 --> 00:36:39.326
I stuck branches on the ground...

893
00:36:39.326 --> 00:36:40.826
- to make a circle with this. - This one?

894
00:36:40.826 --> 00:36:43.027
Then I built a fire in the middle.

895
00:36:43.567 --> 00:36:45.127
The vinyl reflects the heat.

896
00:36:45.127 --> 00:36:46.226
It keeps your back warm.

897
00:36:46.226 --> 00:36:47.237
Yes.

898
00:36:47.667 --> 00:36:49.467
It would be the best...

899
00:36:49.467 --> 00:36:51.366
- to do that. - That would be easier.

900
00:36:53.136 --> 00:36:55.437
When I received the survival training,

901
00:36:56.406 --> 00:36:58.607
the instructor taught me this method.

902
00:36:58.906 --> 00:37:00.717
That's how I slept in the freezing temperature.

903
00:37:00.717 --> 00:37:02.016
(He had tried the method.)

904
00:37:02.016 --> 00:37:04.516
If we put foil in a circle...

905
00:37:04.516 --> 00:37:06.187
and build a fire,

906
00:37:06.187 --> 00:37:07.987
our backs will be heated up...

907
00:37:07.987 --> 00:37:09.817
from the reflected light.

908
00:37:11.786 --> 00:37:14.496
(He gets to work.)

909
00:37:15.757 --> 00:37:17.127
Take this wood.

910
00:37:19.167 --> 00:37:20.866
Will this be a pillar?

911
00:37:20.866 --> 00:37:22.366
- It will be a pillar. - A pillar.

912
00:37:22.937 --> 00:37:25.567
If you hand it over to me, I will drag it away.

913
00:37:27.237 --> 00:37:28.237
Be careful.

914
00:37:29.737 --> 00:37:34.417
(Chief Byung Man cuts.)

915
00:37:34.417 --> 00:37:36.016
(Seung Soo tosses.)

916
00:37:36.016 --> 00:37:37.087
Be careful.

917
00:37:37.087 --> 00:37:38.587
(Jin Young carries.)

918
00:37:40.286 --> 00:37:42.187
Move out of the way. I will throw it.

919
00:37:43.956 --> 00:37:45.926
(Express shipping)

920
00:37:45.926 --> 00:37:47.726
(Running over)

921
00:37:48.826 --> 00:37:51.967
(Jin Young speeds up as well.)

922
00:37:55.536 --> 00:37:57.866
(Jin Young delivers the wood very fast.)

923
00:37:57.866 --> 00:38:02.777
(She puts her muscles into it.)

924
00:38:02.777 --> 00:38:04.206
Jin Young.

925
00:38:04.206 --> 00:38:05.576
(She is speedy.)

926
00:38:06.947 --> 00:38:08.147
Take the next one.

927
00:38:08.147 --> 00:38:10.487
Are we done? We are done.

928
00:38:12.817 --> 00:38:15.187
Let's build it over here.

929
00:38:15.857 --> 00:38:17.127
- It will be easier. - Over there?

930
00:38:17.627 --> 00:38:18.926
Yes. Let's build it over here.

931
00:38:18.926 --> 00:38:20.326
(They build the house where the wood is.)

932
00:38:20.326 --> 00:38:21.326
All right.

933
00:38:21.726 --> 00:38:24.197
Don't we need to dig a hole to drive in the log?

934
00:38:24.697 --> 00:38:25.697
That's right.

935
00:38:26.067 --> 00:38:27.397
Let's keep it simple.

936
00:38:27.397 --> 00:38:28.397
(Don't worry.)

937
00:38:28.397 --> 00:38:29.897
Why don't we make a chum?

938
00:38:31.406 --> 00:38:33.366
A chum. Hold on.

939
00:38:33.366 --> 00:38:35.277
- What's a chum? - It's...

940
00:38:36.107 --> 00:38:39.806
It's a tent you see in Siberia.

941
00:38:40.846 --> 00:38:42.676
- It's made with reindeer hides. - That's the shape we want.

942
00:38:42.676 --> 00:38:43.687
Yes.

943
00:38:45.947 --> 00:38:49.917
(A temporary dwelling that represents the tundra)

944
00:38:49.917 --> 00:38:52.587
(Chum is made by wrapping reindeer hides...)

945
00:38:52.587 --> 00:38:55.156
(around wooden poles that are organized in a circle.)

946
00:38:55.156 --> 00:38:57.496
(Can you make it in Patagonia?)

947
00:38:58.297 --> 00:39:00.237
Shall I trim it?

948
00:39:00.897 --> 00:39:02.636
Yes. Please trim it.

949
00:39:02.797 --> 00:39:04.967
Let's trim the smaller branches.

950
00:39:05.467 --> 00:39:06.536
That's the way.

951
00:39:06.937 --> 00:39:08.607
We needed a structure with a roof...

952
00:39:09.676 --> 00:39:10.706
that will block the wind.

953
00:39:11.047 --> 00:39:14.016
Making a dome-shaped house would have taken too long.

954
00:39:15.016 --> 00:39:18.616
That's why I decided to build it like a chum in tundra.

955
00:39:18.616 --> 00:39:19.647
It's faster.

956
00:39:20.587 --> 00:39:23.217
That's good. You are almost there.

957
00:39:23.217 --> 00:39:24.286
You are doing well.

958
00:39:24.627 --> 00:39:26.226
(Grunting)

959
00:39:26.226 --> 00:39:27.226
You did it.

960
00:39:27.226 --> 00:39:28.757
(Jin Young has the power.)

961
00:39:29.397 --> 00:39:30.897
- All right. - Hold on.

962
00:39:30.897 --> 00:39:34.036
Let's take turns. I will go next.

963
00:39:34.797 --> 00:39:35.797
Hold it.

964
00:39:36.667 --> 00:39:37.967
It feels hot now.

965
00:39:38.906 --> 00:39:39.906
- Doesn't it feel hot? - It does, right?

966
00:39:40.237 --> 00:39:41.536
- It feels hot when you work. - Yes.

967
00:39:42.377 --> 00:39:44.047
Shall we keep on working without building the house?

968
00:39:44.047 --> 00:39:45.147
(Isn't it a good idea?)

969
00:39:45.576 --> 00:39:47.676
I think it will be a good idea.

970
00:39:47.676 --> 00:39:49.246
(It's the most short-sighted way to fight the cold.)

971
00:39:50.417 --> 00:39:54.286
(He ties the branches with a rope.)

972
00:39:54.616 --> 00:39:55.656
Now,

973
00:39:56.056 --> 00:39:57.386
we will lift them up.

974
00:39:58.087 --> 00:40:00.226
Then we will spread the branches.

975
00:40:00.556 --> 00:40:01.556
That's right.

976
00:40:01.556 --> 00:40:02.596
(They lift up the branches.)

977
00:40:03.357 --> 00:40:04.366
Spread them.

978
00:40:05.496 --> 00:40:06.967
(My goodness.)

979
00:40:06.967 --> 00:40:09.697
These are like octopus legs.

980
00:40:11.906 --> 00:40:15.136
(The wooden posts stand upright very easily.)

981
00:40:15.136 --> 00:40:18.706
Now, put these branches between them.

982
00:40:18.706 --> 00:40:20.277
Can I simply lay it on the top?

983
00:40:20.277 --> 00:40:22.076
Yes. Lay it on the top for now.

984
00:40:22.076 --> 00:40:23.447
(They add more columns.)

985
00:40:23.447 --> 00:40:26.346
We will wrap them with foil and leaves.

986
00:40:27.187 --> 00:40:28.616
In the open space,

987
00:40:29.357 --> 00:40:31.487
we needed to build a house...

988
00:40:31.487 --> 00:40:33.797
that will block out the wind and rain.

989
00:40:33.797 --> 00:40:35.397
Chief Byung Man gave the perfect idea.

990
00:40:35.397 --> 00:40:36.556
(It's the best idea.)

991
00:40:37.897 --> 00:40:39.127
(Amazing)

992
00:40:39.127 --> 00:40:40.496
- Like this... - It's a house.

993
00:40:41.337 --> 00:40:42.337
Hold on.

994
00:40:42.337 --> 00:40:44.007
(Chae Yeon joins them with foil in her hands.)

995
00:40:44.206 --> 00:40:45.237
(The structure is complete.)

996
00:40:48.377 --> 00:40:50.346
A little bit more. There you go.

997
00:40:50.346 --> 00:40:51.947
(It's time to wrap the columns with foil.)

998
00:40:55.016 --> 00:40:56.047
This is...

999
00:40:56.047 --> 00:40:57.346
(The wind is strong.)

1000
00:40:57.346 --> 00:40:59.786
Press it down here.

1001
00:41:00.317 --> 00:41:04.857
(Strong wind hinders the speedy construction process.)

1002
00:41:04.955 --> 00:41:05.986
It's so windy.

1003
00:41:06.556 --> 00:41:07.585
It's stronger.

1004
00:41:07.585 --> 00:41:11.656
(The wind becomes stronger.)

1005
00:41:11.795 --> 00:41:15.495
Put it against the column.

1006
00:41:15.495 --> 00:41:18.095
(We really need a place to avoid the winds)

1007
00:41:19.303 --> 00:41:22.319
(They need to hurry up before their physical strength and body temperature drops)

1008
00:41:22.343 --> 00:41:25.343
(Will they be able to finish it before it gets dark?)

1009
00:41:26.067 --> 00:41:31.067
<font color="#F1E6B2">[VIU Ver] E302 The Law of Jungle</font>

<font color="#7474C1">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

1010
00:41:31.767 --> 00:41:34.035
(They began to work on wrapping the house.)

1011
00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:37.300
It's so windy.

1012
00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:38.300
(The biting wind blows from the snow-capped mountain.)

1013
00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:40.201
We need to work fast.

1014
00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:42.731
(The wind and cold make them work in a hurry.)

1015
00:41:42.731 --> 00:41:46.440
Put it against the column.

1016
00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:50.181
(They are halfway done.)

1017
00:41:50.181 --> 00:41:52.740
(Is the house effective?)

1018
00:41:54.811 --> 00:41:56.311
There is less wind.

1019
00:41:57.550 --> 00:41:58.780
It's nice.

1020
00:42:00.521 --> 00:42:02.791
- How is it? - It's warm.

1021
00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:05.590
It's nice.

1022
00:42:05.590 --> 00:42:06.661
(Byung Man's house blocks out the wind properly.)

1023
00:42:07.791 --> 00:42:08.990
Cover it densely.

1024
00:42:09.731 --> 00:42:13.331
Byung Man's Tribe experienced how effective the foil is...

1025
00:42:13.331 --> 00:42:15.170
in warming up the house and keeping the wind out.

1026
00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:17.141
So that the wall doesn't move,

1027
00:42:17.141 --> 00:42:19.670
they cover the bottom with dirt.

1028
00:42:20.541 --> 00:42:22.911
Once they make the roof and build a fire,

1029
00:42:22.911 --> 00:42:26.610
a house that can withstand the cold wave will be completed.

1030
00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:31.081
(Dong Jun and JR are fighting against the fire.)

1031
00:42:31.081 --> 00:42:32.121
Here.

1032
00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:35.791
It's impossible to start the fire.

1033
00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:37.920
That's right.

1034
00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:39.260
(It will be hard to build a fire that way.)

1035
00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:40.331
That's right.

1036
00:42:41.431 --> 00:42:43.900
Hold on. Let's...

1037
00:42:44.530 --> 00:42:45.860
No.

1038
00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:47.170
(Seung Soo joins them.)

1039
00:42:47.170 --> 00:42:48.231
Do it like this.

1040
00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:51.970
Did you grind it?

1041
00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:54.141
You need to grind it some more.

1042
00:42:55.541 --> 00:42:56.570
(Seung Soo's know-how lies in a lot of flint dust.)

1043
00:42:56.570 --> 00:42:57.641
Shall we make a lot?

1044
00:42:58.141 --> 00:42:59.311
We need a lot.

1045
00:42:59.311 --> 00:43:02.251
If you strike it hard, it catches on fire.

1046
00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:03.581
(They are absorbed.)

1047
00:43:03.581 --> 00:43:04.621
Like this.

1048
00:43:05.251 --> 00:43:07.420
(He feels reassured to have him.)

1049
00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:09.121
(Spark)

1050
00:43:09.121 --> 00:43:11.420
(The veteran's spark is on a different level.)

1051
00:43:13.021 --> 00:43:14.431
(It looks different.)

1052
00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:19.201
(He strikes with more force.)

1053
00:43:19.201 --> 00:43:20.201
It caught on fire.

1054
00:43:20.201 --> 00:43:21.331
(Did it catch on fire?)

1055
00:43:22.431 --> 00:43:24.170
(Please)

1056
00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:28.871
(The flame burns bright...)

1057
00:43:28.871 --> 00:43:30.541
(and dies.)

1058
00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:34.711
(For goodness sake.)

1059
00:43:35.010 --> 00:43:36.050
This is...

1060
00:43:36.610 --> 00:43:38.621
(His dignity dies with the flame.)

1061
00:43:38.621 --> 00:43:39.681
For goodness sake.

1062
00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:42.990
- You are bleeding. - It's okay.

1063
00:43:43.590 --> 00:43:46.561
- It's okay. - You might've worked too hard.

1064
00:43:46.561 --> 00:43:47.990
Is there a tissue?

1065
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:50.201
I just need a Band-Aid.

1066
00:43:53.771 --> 00:43:57.271
The last time I was on the show, I succeeded after four tries.

1067
00:43:57.271 --> 00:43:58.300
You did it right away.

1068
00:43:59.670 --> 00:44:00.740
All right.

1069
00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:06.211
All right.

1070
00:44:07.050 --> 00:44:09.181
It looks like it will work.

1071
00:44:10.251 --> 00:44:11.251
For goodness sake.

1072
00:44:11.251 --> 00:44:12.581
It's like "The Fast and the Furious".

1073
00:44:12.581 --> 00:44:13.590
I really want this to work.

1074
00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:18.590
We worked on it for two hours.

1075
00:44:18.590 --> 00:44:20.891
We didn't do anything else for two hours.

1076
00:44:20.891 --> 00:44:24.231
We worry if we would be able to survive well.

1077
00:44:24.231 --> 00:44:25.260
(JR is motionless.)

1078
00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:26.771
Look at this.

1079
00:44:26.771 --> 00:44:29.070
The fire steel is almost gone.

1080
00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:30.601
My goodness.

1081
00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:32.570
(The fire steel became slim.)

1082
00:44:32.570 --> 00:44:33.641
My goodness.

1083
00:44:33.811 --> 00:44:35.340
We can't keep a flame going.

1084
00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:36.981
(Will the trio be able to build a fire?)

1085
00:44:36.981 --> 00:44:38.641
The kindling is wet.

1086
00:44:39.481 --> 00:44:41.251
(How is the house building going?)

1087
00:44:42.481 --> 00:44:44.351
Unfold it.

1088
00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:45.481
Open it up. Yes.

1089
00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:50.291
One second. Hey, we only need a few.

1090
00:44:50.661 --> 00:44:53.590
(Wide leaves are perfect to cover the roof.)

1091
00:44:58.630 --> 00:45:00.231
Is this edible?

1092
00:45:00.530 --> 00:45:01.601
The bottom.

1093
00:45:01.601 --> 00:45:03.170
- Bottom? - Yes.

1094
00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:06.541
(They cut this tree like a taro leaf.)

1095
00:45:06.911 --> 00:45:09.110
(Gunnera Tinctoria leaves are edible,)

1096
00:45:09.110 --> 00:45:11.280
(and it's full of fibre and moisture.)

1097
00:45:12.681 --> 00:45:14.911
(Moisture?)

1098
00:45:15.010 --> 00:45:16.920
(He takes a bite.)

1099
00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:19.150
(It tastes weird.)

1100
00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:22.351
How is it?

1101
00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:26.961
- It's better than I expected. - Really?

1102
00:45:27.331 --> 00:45:30.061
(Chief Byung Man tries it.)

1103
00:45:30.061 --> 00:45:32.300
(It looks like he's peeling sugar cane.)

1104
00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:37.840
Moisture taste.

1105
00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:39.601
(What does it taste like?)

1106
00:45:42.610 --> 00:45:45.081
It's not bad. It tastes like fruit.

1107
00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:46.641
It's sour and sweet.

1108
00:45:46.641 --> 00:45:47.650
It tastes like a sour fruit.

1109
00:45:48.811 --> 00:45:51.351
I feel like I'm getting hydrated.

1110
00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:55.451
I wanted to try it.

1111
00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:58.291
Picking food from the ground.

1112
00:45:58.291 --> 00:46:00.561
(It can cover the roof and provide hydration.)

1113
00:46:01.461 --> 00:46:03.530
(It's raining again.)

1114
00:46:06.561 --> 00:46:07.970
It's raining more.

1115
00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:09.800
No.

1116
00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:15.570
(The weather in Patagonia is fickle.)

1117
00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:16.981
It rained.

1118
00:46:17.110 --> 00:46:21.081
All the firewood was wet. We couldn't light the fire.

1119
00:46:21.081 --> 00:46:22.081
(Neither the house nor the fire is ready yet.)

1120
00:46:22.081 --> 00:46:24.720
It was very cold. I was hungry.

1121
00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:26.951
It was raining. I was wet.

1122
00:46:27.621 --> 00:46:29.720
The rain started pouring down.

1123
00:46:29.851 --> 00:46:35.161
When I saw how strong the wind was,

1124
00:46:35.161 --> 00:46:38.961
I thought we might not be able to...

1125
00:46:38.961 --> 00:46:40.331
light the fire.

1126
00:46:41.201 --> 00:46:44.001
Hey. Should we cover it one more time since it's raining?

1127
00:46:44.001 --> 00:46:47.371
- Yes. - Remove this.

1128
00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:51.880
First, move this.

1129
00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:53.711
I didn't expect it to be so bad.

1130
00:46:54.311 --> 00:46:56.251
- I didn't expected the rain. - Spread it.

1131
00:46:57.581 --> 00:46:59.981
This time, it was a battle with hypothermia,

1132
00:47:00.650 --> 00:47:03.661
cold, and rain.

1133
00:47:04.291 --> 00:47:07.760
(It's hard to repair the house due to strong wind.)

1134
00:47:10.561 --> 00:47:11.701
Here. Here.

1135
00:47:11.701 --> 00:47:15.130
(It's hard to survive without the house.)

1136
00:47:15.130 --> 00:47:16.331
Here. Grab it.

1137
00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:17.670
Here.

1138
00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:19.001
(Slowly one by one)

1139
00:47:22.070 --> 00:47:23.440
Hold it.

1140
00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:24.780
(The roof is almost completed.)

1141
00:47:25.211 --> 00:47:26.641
- It's raining too much. - What is this?

1142
00:47:26.641 --> 00:47:28.081
(They're still struggling to light the fire.)

1143
00:47:28.081 --> 00:47:30.920
(Then Dong Jun takes a place bag out from his bag.)

1144
00:47:31.451 --> 00:47:33.181
Yes. That one.

1145
00:47:33.181 --> 00:47:34.391
How about we do it inside this?

1146
00:47:35.021 --> 00:47:36.650
Sure. Try it inside.

1147
00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:39.391
(Dong Jun plans the best way to block the rain...)

1148
00:47:40.791 --> 00:47:43.630
(and performs it right away.)

1149
00:47:44.530 --> 00:47:45.701
A bit more.

1150
00:47:45.701 --> 00:47:47.470
What's wrong with you?

1151
00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:48.931
(Endurance)

1152
00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:50.800
- Goodness. - Too late.

1153
00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:51.840
(Seung Soo)

1154
00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:53.340
(Dong Jun)

1155
00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:55.840
(People who experienced the jungle keeps failing.)

1156
00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:58.711
(The fire is not burning, but their hearts are.)

1157
00:48:00.911 --> 00:48:04.251
- When that part dries, it burns. - Yes.

1158
00:48:04.251 --> 00:48:06.081
The wet part dries.

1159
00:48:06.081 --> 00:48:08.590
It burns a little then goes off.

1160
00:48:10.561 --> 00:48:11.820
Should I try it?

1161
00:48:12.461 --> 00:48:13.530
You must be exhausted.

1162
00:48:13.530 --> 00:48:14.831
(JR takes the baton.)

1163
00:48:14.831 --> 00:48:15.931
We should...

1164
00:48:19.001 --> 00:48:21.030
(Lighting)

1165
00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:24.001
(Even the camera crew is exhausted from the long wait.)

1166
00:48:25.541 --> 00:48:27.110
(Then JR lighted the fire.)

1167
00:48:32.981 --> 00:48:35.550
(The fire becomes stronger with Seung Soo's breath.)

1168
00:48:35.550 --> 00:48:37.181
Good. Good.

1169
00:48:37.181 --> 00:48:38.220
(It's ignited.)

1170
00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:39.220
We did it.

1171
00:48:39.851 --> 00:48:42.190
Not yet. Not yet.

1172
00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:43.860
(Always pay attention.)

1173
00:48:44.791 --> 00:48:48.291
(They make a stable fire with small firewood.)

1174
00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:52.731
We did it. The fire is on.

1175
00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:54.771
- Did you do it? - We did it.

1176
00:48:54.771 --> 00:48:55.771
(Well done.)

1177
00:48:55.771 --> 00:48:57.340
- How long did it take? - JR did it.

1178
00:48:57.340 --> 00:48:58.840
- What? - JR did it.

1179
00:48:59.101 --> 00:49:01.871
- Do you get how annoying it is? - What?

1180
00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:03.380
I didn't know...

1181
00:49:03.411 --> 00:49:05.581
how hard it is to light a fire in the rain.

1182
00:49:07.681 --> 00:49:09.851
I thought it'd be easy...

1183
00:49:10.121 --> 00:49:12.681
when I saw it on TV.

1184
00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:15.090
But it was different in reality.

1185
00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:17.391
Your effort is the most important.

1186
00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:19.590
If you keep telling yourself you can do it,

1187
00:49:19.590 --> 00:49:20.891
it will work at one moment.

1188
00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:22.291
Steadiness?

1189
00:49:22.291 --> 00:49:24.030
(JR's encyclopedia on how to build a fire: The secret is to be steady.)

1190
00:49:24.561 --> 00:49:27.070
It's a triumph for man.

1191
00:49:28.501 --> 00:49:30.701
It's warm. It's nice.

1192
00:49:31.001 --> 00:49:33.440
With their perseverance,

1193
00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:35.440
they finally succeeded in igniting the fire.

1194
00:49:36.110 --> 00:49:39.681
A house that will keep them warm, and a warm fire.

1195
00:49:39.711 --> 00:49:41.851
It'll be perfect with food.

1196
00:49:43.351 --> 00:49:44.720
(They went out to search for food.)

1197
00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:47.190
- Watch out for the thorns. - Thorns.

1198
00:49:50.121 --> 00:49:53.891
- We must find food. - Right.

1199
00:49:53.891 --> 00:49:55.990
They're all working so hard.

1200
00:49:55.990 --> 00:49:57.030
Be careful.

1201
00:49:57.731 --> 00:50:00.670
(Will they find any food here?)

1202
00:50:00.670 --> 00:50:02.570
There has to be something to eat.

1203
00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:09.411
(There must be something.)

1204
00:50:10.481 --> 00:50:12.740
(There were a lot of berries when I saw it on TV.)

1205
00:50:13.981 --> 00:50:16.751
(Come out, food.)

1206
00:50:16.751 --> 00:50:18.851
I can't find anything.

1207
00:50:20.851 --> 00:50:21.891
There's nothing.

1208
00:50:22.251 --> 00:50:23.760
Let's check out the river.

1209
00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:27.030
- There must be food near the river. - Yes.

1210
00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:28.030
(So they turn to the river.)

1211
00:50:28.061 --> 00:50:29.391
(While searching...)

1212
00:50:29.391 --> 00:50:31.161
Watch out for the thorns. It stings.

1213
00:50:31.601 --> 00:50:33.300
Watch out for the thorns. It stings.

1214
00:50:33.670 --> 00:50:36.470
Become a thorn

1215
00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:39.271
(She lights up the mood with a thorn.)

1216
00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:43.740
(Dong Jun sings along.)

1217
00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:45.240
(Everyone's getting addicted by Jin Young's happy virus.)

1218
00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:46.510
Go home

1219
00:50:46.981 --> 00:50:49.081
Let's please go

1220
00:50:49.150 --> 00:50:50.880
(Are you excited, Dong Jun?)

1221
00:50:51.251 --> 00:50:53.920
When everyone is so down,

1222
00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:55.851
I wish people around me...

1223
00:50:55.851 --> 00:50:57.860
stay cheerful.

1224
00:50:58.190 --> 00:51:00.891
I don't get depressed naturally.

1225
00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:02.760
Jungle. Jungle.

1226
00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:04.030
(Come to me, jungle.)

1227
00:51:04.030 --> 00:51:05.201
Goodness.

1228
00:51:05.831 --> 00:51:09.331
(Since Jin Young lights up the mood,)

1229
00:51:09.331 --> 00:51:13.371
(Dong Jun is excited again.)

1230
00:51:13.371 --> 00:51:15.911
For how long can you stay cheerful?

1231
00:51:16.070 --> 00:51:19.311
For how long are you going to make my shoulders dance

1232
00:51:21.550 --> 00:51:23.981
(Two people are searching in excitement.)

1233
00:51:23.981 --> 00:51:25.920
(Carefully)

1234
00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:27.391
What is that?

1235
00:51:27.791 --> 00:51:28.791
(They finally found it.)

1236
00:51:28.791 --> 00:51:31.190
- There's something here. - It looks like blueberry.

1237
00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:32.220
I know, right?

1238
00:51:32.220 --> 00:51:34.260
(Blueberry?)

1239
00:51:34.490 --> 00:51:35.690
It's a berry.

1240
00:51:36.130 --> 00:51:37.231
I'm hungry.

1241
00:51:37.431 --> 00:51:39.101
I wish it tastes like blueberry.

1242
00:51:39.661 --> 00:51:41.300
It looks sweet.

1243
00:51:42.331 --> 00:51:43.800
- Should we try it? - I ignited the fire.

1244
00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:45.070
- What? - I ignited the fire.

1245
00:51:45.070 --> 00:51:46.271
- Really? How? - Really?

1246
00:51:46.271 --> 00:51:47.740
Come here.

1247
00:51:47.740 --> 00:51:48.871
- Hey, JR. - Yes?

1248
00:51:48.871 --> 00:51:50.240
- Over here. - Let's bring this.

1249
00:51:50.481 --> 00:51:52.811
- What is that? - I'm not sure. Let's pick it first.

1250
00:51:52.811 --> 00:51:54.811
Let's ask them if it's edible.

1251
00:51:55.251 --> 00:51:56.681
- Look. - There's one here too.

1252
00:51:57.050 --> 00:51:58.380
Right. Let's pick it first.

1253
00:51:58.550 --> 00:52:00.351
I wish it's edible.

1254
00:52:00.820 --> 00:52:01.990
Should I try it?

1255
00:52:01.990 --> 00:52:02.990
(You'll know when you eat it.)

1256
00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:04.621
Are you going to eat it?

1257
00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:08.731
(She tries it.)

1258
00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:11.530
(What does calafate taste like?)

1259
00:52:11.530 --> 00:52:14.101
(How is it?)

1260
00:52:14.331 --> 00:52:16.470
(He wishes it to be sweet.)

1261
00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:20.110
(It's hard to read her face.)

1262
00:52:20.110 --> 00:52:23.411
It's like eating a lemon seed.

1263
00:52:23.541 --> 00:52:26.081
It tastes like eating a lemon seed. I think we can eat it.

1264
00:52:26.081 --> 00:52:28.751
- Really? - Yes. Pick them.

1265
00:52:28.751 --> 00:52:30.451
(He starts picking them after what Jin Young said.)

1266
00:52:30.451 --> 00:52:31.521
It stings.

1267
00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:33.951
I'm hungry. They're up there too.

1268
00:52:33.990 --> 00:52:35.590
- Is there? - Yes.

1269
00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:38.320
The foot of the candle is dark. There are some down here.

1270
00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:41.590
- I got it. - I want every one of them.

1271
00:52:41.590 --> 00:52:43.431
(35th Byung Man's Tribe's first food in Chile is calafate.)

1272
00:52:43.431 --> 00:52:45.561
Do we have enough? Let's collect it.

1273
00:52:46.561 --> 00:52:48.271
- We've picked a lot. - Yes.

1274
00:52:48.630 --> 00:52:49.731
- Let's go now. - Okay.

1275
00:52:50.170 --> 00:52:53.271
I think each person can have like 10.

1276
00:52:53.271 --> 00:52:55.110
(They've been picking them hard, but that's all they have.)

1277
00:52:55.641 --> 00:52:57.481
I don't think this is enough.

1278
00:52:57.481 --> 00:52:58.541
(This will never be enough.)

1279
00:52:58.541 --> 00:53:00.681
Each person needs like 120 of this.

1280
00:53:01.311 --> 00:53:02.851
Last time I was here,

1281
00:53:03.081 --> 00:53:05.280
there was a fruit called rambutan.

1282
00:53:05.420 --> 00:53:06.481
Rambutan?

1283
00:53:06.481 --> 00:53:09.391
- Yes. It's sweet and sour. - Okay.

1284
00:53:09.391 --> 00:53:10.461
We had that.

1285
00:53:10.461 --> 00:53:11.521
(They had so much that they were busy picking fruit.)

1286
00:53:11.521 --> 00:53:14.130
We had a lot of fish too.

1287
00:53:15.990 --> 00:53:17.760
(The wild versus the extreme)

1288
00:53:18.101 --> 00:53:21.300
I wish this was the size of geobong.

1289
00:53:21.470 --> 00:53:24.701
I wish it pops like popcorn...

1290
00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:26.400
- and expands, right? - Yes.

1291
00:53:26.871 --> 00:53:29.811
I think this is the best we can eat today.

1292
00:53:29.811 --> 00:53:32.880
At least, we have food, right?

1293
00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:34.650
- Yes. - It's awesome.

1294
00:53:34.650 --> 00:53:36.880
- It's like blueberries. - Byung Man. We picked berries.

1295
00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:38.581
Is this edible?

1296
00:53:38.581 --> 00:53:41.090
- Did you pick them from the ground? - No. From a tree.

1297
00:53:41.090 --> 00:53:43.021
- From a tree? - Didn't we eat this before?

1298
00:53:45.490 --> 00:53:47.791
- It's sour and sweet. - It's sour.

1299
00:53:49.431 --> 00:53:51.931
(They rush to eat after the Chief.)

1300
00:53:51.931 --> 00:53:52.961
(It's not bad.)

1301
00:53:52.961 --> 00:53:54.231
Do I have to spit it out?

1302
00:53:54.570 --> 00:53:56.101
Can I eat the whole thing?

1303
00:53:56.101 --> 00:53:57.541
- Yes. - I see.

1304
00:53:59.340 --> 00:54:01.711
- It's sour and sweet. - It's sour.

1305
00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:05.081
It's still good.

1306
00:54:05.081 --> 00:54:06.211
(Wild berry, calafate is healthy and sweet.)

1307
00:54:06.211 --> 00:54:08.711
I don't get full with it,

1308
00:54:08.711 --> 00:54:10.380
but I taste something.

1309
00:54:10.851 --> 00:54:14.650
I'm sure we won't stop eating it when we become hungry...

1310
00:54:14.650 --> 00:54:16.590
tomorrow or the day after.

1311
00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:19.920
(During the survival,)

1312
00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:21.931
(they keep eating.)

1313
00:54:23.190 --> 00:54:27.070
(Into the deep and dark taste of super food, calafate)

1314
00:54:28.670 --> 00:54:30.101
(Thank you very much, wild berry.)

1315
00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:34.240
(Look forward to the sweet and exciting jungle.)

1316
00:54:35.041 --> 00:54:37.780
- This is pretty good. - I'm getting addicted to it.

1317
00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:39.010
It's the good restaurant in Chile.

1318
00:54:39.411 --> 00:54:40.751
- Chae Yeon. - Just two.

1319
00:54:40.751 --> 00:54:42.880
(Good food tastes better when you share it.)

1320
00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:43.951
It's still good.

1321
00:54:44.521 --> 00:54:45.951
- Byung Man. - Yes?

1322
00:54:45.951 --> 00:54:47.420
(The Chief worked hard to build the house.)

1323
00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:49.650
Open.

1324
00:54:49.650 --> 00:54:51.490
(She pops in the berry with her cute act.)

1325
00:54:51.860 --> 00:54:55.760
You must stay healthy so that all of us can survive together.

1326
00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:56.860
I just tasted it first.

1327
00:54:57.931 --> 00:54:59.860
(Jin Young feeds the Chief,)

1328
00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:02.170
(puts berries in his mouth,)

1329
00:55:02.170 --> 00:55:04.701
(and takes good care of him.)

1330
00:55:04.701 --> 00:55:06.141
- She's good to him. - I had a lot.

1331
00:55:06.141 --> 00:55:08.570
Don't feed me too many of those.

1332
00:55:08.570 --> 00:55:10.110
It will keep your strength up as long as it's in your mouth.

1333
00:55:10.110 --> 00:55:11.211
(Pretend that they are supplements.)

1334
00:55:12.010 --> 00:55:13.280
I should go to that side.

1335
00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:15.150
(Jin Young, that's enough now.)

1336
00:55:16.351 --> 00:55:17.681
She keeps giving me that.

1337
00:55:18.021 --> 00:55:19.380
- She's good at feeding us. - That, she is.

1338
00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:20.851
- She's good at that. - But you're not eating it.

1339
00:55:20.851 --> 00:55:21.891
I'm eating too.

1340
00:55:22.650 --> 00:55:24.690
(But thank you for taking care of us.)

1341
00:55:24.961 --> 00:55:29.090
I think this is all the food we'll probably eat for the day.

1342
00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:31.630
Savour it.

1343
00:55:33.530 --> 00:55:35.070
Dong Jun, did you eat three at once?

1344
00:55:35.070 --> 00:55:36.201
No, no.

1345
00:55:36.231 --> 00:55:37.240
I ate two at once.

1346
00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:38.240
- Two? - Yes.

1347
00:55:39.541 --> 00:55:40.641
But it's still good.

1348
00:55:41.110 --> 00:55:45.110
I'll take the lantern with me. If there's fish, I'll go in.

1349
00:55:45.681 --> 00:55:47.650
- Let's take a look around first. - Okay.

1350
00:55:47.650 --> 00:55:49.681
- Should we get going? - Let's search for fish first.

1351
00:55:49.681 --> 00:55:52.150
If we go that way, we can go down there.

1352
00:55:52.150 --> 00:55:54.251
We should go. Let's follow them.

1353
00:55:54.291 --> 00:55:56.090
- Okay. - We should accompany them.

1354
00:55:56.860 --> 00:55:58.621
Byung Man, there's a spot at the end over there.

1355
00:55:58.621 --> 00:55:59.621
Where?

1356
00:55:59.661 --> 00:56:01.690
- Did you find the spot yourself? - First of all...

1357
00:56:01.690 --> 00:56:04.931
I left a mark over there.

1358
00:56:05.331 --> 00:56:06.530
You left a mark there?

1359
00:56:06.530 --> 00:56:08.300
Where the water is calm.

1360
00:56:08.300 --> 00:56:11.840
(Jin Young looked around the water before the sunset with Min Hyuk.)

1361
00:56:11.970 --> 00:56:16.470
(They left a mark where there might be fish.)

1362
00:56:17.641 --> 00:56:19.840
- You found a spot. - There will be fish for certain...

1363
00:56:20.050 --> 00:56:22.311
in the spot with a butterfly net.

1364
00:56:22.851 --> 00:56:25.280
- Can you shine the water? - Jin Young put up the mark.

1365
00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:27.050
Right here. Here.

1366
00:56:27.050 --> 00:56:28.621
- It's not deep. - Don't you think so?

1367
00:56:28.650 --> 00:56:30.391
- The water is so clear. - The water is clear.

1368
00:56:30.391 --> 00:56:32.420
- It's clear. - Since it's clear...

1369
00:56:32.661 --> 00:56:35.391
Don't you think they will be around this bush?

1370
00:56:36.931 --> 00:56:38.961
(Let me see.)

1371
00:56:40.701 --> 00:56:42.871
(He checks the area thoroughly.)

1372
00:56:45.900 --> 00:56:46.970
Try dipping your hand.

1373
00:56:46.970 --> 00:56:48.411
(The Chief moves closer to the water.)

1374
00:56:48.411 --> 00:56:49.670
Byung Man, we can find fish here, right?

1375
00:56:50.110 --> 00:56:53.141
(Are we going to eat some fish at last?)

1376
00:56:55.110 --> 00:56:57.121
(He checks the temperature before going in.)

1377
00:56:58.951 --> 00:56:59.951
(Sighing)

1378
00:56:59.951 --> 00:57:01.320
- You're not going in? - This is...

1379
00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:04.891
(What's wrong?)

1380
00:57:06.121 --> 00:57:08.661
People shouldn't go in there.

1381
00:57:11.061 --> 00:57:12.501
(The water is painfully cold.)

1382
00:57:12.501 --> 00:57:13.530
My hand hurts.

1383
00:57:14.201 --> 00:57:15.231
(It's too cold to stay in the water.)

1384
00:57:15.231 --> 00:57:16.970
It hurts, doesn't it?

1385
00:57:17.601 --> 00:57:18.641
I told you.

1386
00:57:20.110 --> 00:57:22.510
I think even the fish might freeze.

1387
00:57:23.641 --> 00:57:25.041
- The current is strong too. - Even if I go in,

1388
00:57:25.041 --> 00:57:27.311
I won't be able to see anything underwater.

1389
00:57:28.050 --> 00:57:30.320
When I caught a trout,

1390
00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:34.220
there were some bushes.

1391
00:57:34.220 --> 00:57:35.751
I went in after seeing the fish.

1392
00:57:35.891 --> 00:57:38.860
I dove in after I saw the fish from outside.

1393
00:57:39.161 --> 00:57:40.690
Swimming goggles. You must bring me my swimming goggles.

1394
00:57:40.891 --> 00:57:43.501
(No matter how cold and dark the water is,)

1395
00:57:43.900 --> 00:57:46.530
(the Chief would go into the water when he spots fish...)

1396
00:57:46.530 --> 00:57:50.601
(and overcome the crisis.)

1397
00:57:50.601 --> 00:57:52.300
Gosh, it's cold. It's freezing.

1398
00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:54.041
(But he doesn't see any fish.)

1399
00:57:54.041 --> 00:57:55.141
I'll only freeze to death.

1400
00:57:56.041 --> 00:57:57.780
- He might freeze to death. - I'm already...

1401
00:57:58.411 --> 00:57:59.780
I'm already beat.

1402
00:57:59.780 --> 00:58:01.481
(The Tribe returns after giving up on hunting.)

1403
00:58:02.081 --> 00:58:04.420
My gosh, it's so cold. Why is it so cold on this side?

1404
00:58:04.420 --> 00:58:06.920
- It's freezing here. - There's a snow-covered mountain.

1405
00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:10.661
The biting cold is coming from where the mountain is.

1406
00:58:10.891 --> 00:58:13.860
First of all, we must make a floor.

1407
00:58:14.130 --> 00:58:15.530
- We must make a floor. - After that,

1408
00:58:15.530 --> 00:58:17.501
- we'll move the fire here. - Yes, we'll do that.

1409
00:58:18.130 --> 00:58:19.161
Somewhere around here.

1410
00:58:19.931 --> 00:58:21.701
That's how the heat...

1411
00:58:22.231 --> 00:58:23.231
will come in.

1412
00:58:23.300 --> 00:58:25.701
- When we move the fire... - No, let me do it, Seung Soo.

1413
00:58:25.701 --> 00:58:26.940
I'll move the fire.

1414
00:58:27.711 --> 00:58:29.311
(Assembling)

1415
00:58:29.470 --> 00:58:30.481
I have to save the fire.

1416
00:58:30.481 --> 00:58:32.211
(He runs as fast as he can.)

1417
00:58:32.211 --> 00:58:33.211
It's hot.

1418
00:58:33.211 --> 00:58:35.110
(He moves it as far as he can.)

1419
00:58:37.220 --> 00:58:38.621
- I did it. - That was amazing.

1420
00:58:38.650 --> 00:58:40.690
- I did it. - Byung Man, that was incredible.

1421
00:58:40.690 --> 00:58:41.920
My hands are warm.

1422
00:58:42.621 --> 00:58:45.320
I want to take this fire.

1423
00:58:46.061 --> 00:58:47.331
It's so small.

1424
00:58:48.530 --> 00:58:49.530
No.

1425
00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:51.461
We must take this too.

1426
00:58:51.630 --> 00:58:55.231
(She feels reverent as if she's carrying the torch.)

1427
00:58:55.900 --> 00:58:56.900
I bought it here.

1428
00:58:56.900 --> 00:58:58.440
(After skipping over the log...)

1429
00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:00.340
The fire is catching on.

1430
00:59:00.340 --> 00:59:01.641
(She moves away from the members.)

1431
00:59:03.271 --> 00:59:04.280
(She safely brings the fire.)

1432
00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:05.311
Every word is a seed.

1433
00:59:05.311 --> 00:59:06.411
(She safely brings the fire.)

1434
00:59:06.411 --> 00:59:07.510
It's catching on.

1435
00:59:09.411 --> 00:59:10.720
(Grinning)

1436
00:59:10.981 --> 00:59:12.621
Dry wood burns up faster.

1437
00:59:13.220 --> 00:59:14.251
Let me see.

1438
00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:16.550
- This is awesome. - Is it?

1439
00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:22.791
- It's spacious. - This is great.

1440
00:59:22.831 --> 00:59:24.400
- Doesn't your face feel warm? - Yes, it does.

1441
00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:27.701
- The heat reflects off your face. - The air is warm in here.

1442
00:59:27.701 --> 00:59:28.731
- It is, right? - Yes, it is.

1443
00:59:29.530 --> 00:59:33.141
The heat keeps circling because it's reflected from the roof.

1444
00:59:33.911 --> 00:59:35.510
- The smoke is going out though. - Right.

1445
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:37.740
- I made a hole on the roof. - I see.

1446
00:59:38.411 --> 00:59:39.780
It feels like a sauna.

1447
00:59:39.780 --> 00:59:41.110
Should we put this up later?

1448
00:59:42.411 --> 00:59:43.650
When I watched Bear Grylls...

1449
00:59:44.521 --> 00:59:47.220
You know pee is warm.

1450
00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:50.220
He said when you put it in a bottle and hug it, it keeps you warm.

1451
00:59:50.860 --> 00:59:51.920
But does it last long?

1452
00:59:52.061 --> 00:59:53.561
Byung Man, should I get mine then?

1453
00:59:53.561 --> 00:59:54.891
(Byung Man, should I get mine then?)

1454
00:59:55.331 --> 00:59:57.501
(Shaking his head)

1455
00:59:57.501 --> 00:59:58.530
(That's too much, Jin Young.)

1456
00:59:58.530 --> 00:59:59.530
What did you say?

1457
00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:02.170
We can heat the water with the fire.

1458
01:00:02.731 --> 01:00:04.940
Hey, why would you bring your pee?

1459
01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:07.740
I was on my way to pee though.

1460
01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:09.311
Were you trying to kill 2 birds with 1 stone?

1461
01:00:09.311 --> 01:00:10.740
- That's right. - You were on the way anyway?

1462
01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:11.880
I think you might really do it.

1463
01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:13.280
(Let's forget about this.)

1464
01:00:15.510 --> 01:00:18.521
Byung Man. Everyone, I brought something.

1465
01:00:18.521 --> 01:00:20.291
Hey, I brought something.

1466
01:00:21.021 --> 01:00:22.021
Why am I worried?

1467
01:00:22.021 --> 01:00:23.021
(They are nervous for some reason.)

1468
01:00:23.021 --> 01:00:24.190
I'm not excited about it.

1469
01:00:26.931 --> 01:00:29.931
(Jin Young confidently takes something out from her bag.)

1470
01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:34.170
First of all, this is a camouflage hat for the Chief.

1471
01:00:35.130 --> 01:00:39.541
(Their plan to stay warm is to bundle up from head to toe.)

1472
01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:40.811
Isn't it nice?

1473
01:00:41.211 --> 01:00:43.211
- Did you bring one for everyone? - Yes.

1474
01:00:43.211 --> 01:00:45.010
(Jin Young bought a hat for everyone.)

1475
01:00:45.010 --> 01:00:46.880
- My gosh, this is nice. - It's great.

1476
01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:48.911
- It's warm. - I really like this hat.

1477
01:00:48.911 --> 01:00:49.911
Isn't it warm?

1478
01:00:49.911 --> 01:00:52.550
This is the best thing you did so far.

1479
01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:55.320
You did a lot of things, but this is the best thing you did so far.

1480
01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:56.990
- It's so warm. - Right.

1481
01:00:57.061 --> 01:00:58.720
This is awesome. Thank you.

1482
01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:00.061
- Thank you. - Thanks.

1483
01:01:00.061 --> 01:01:02.161
- Thank you, Jin Young. - Thank you.

1484
01:01:02.161 --> 01:01:04.831
(Chae Yeon brings something at that moment.)

1485
01:01:04.831 --> 01:01:07.300
I have a gift for you too.

1486
01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:09.231
(I brought a gift too.)

1487
01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:12.641
- Really? - Yes, I made this.

1488
01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:14.911
Hello.

1489
01:01:14.911 --> 01:01:16.610
(Hi. I'm Chae Yeon of DIA.)

1490
01:01:17.380 --> 01:01:20.411
I found out that we're going somewhere cold.

1491
01:01:20.411 --> 01:01:22.050
(For the members of the Tribe who will join her to the jungle,)

1492
01:01:22.181 --> 01:01:23.311
(she decides to make hot packs.)

1493
01:01:23.311 --> 01:01:26.481
I'm going to make hot packs.

1494
01:01:26.891 --> 01:01:28.150
(Doing her best)

1495
01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:30.391
I need to mix these.

1496
01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:33.431
(Chae Yeon puts a lot of effort into making them.)

1497
01:01:34.130 --> 01:01:35.130
This is the curling iron.

1498
01:01:35.961 --> 01:01:38.201
I'll wrap it up like this.

1499
01:01:38.860 --> 01:01:40.030
Ta-da.

1500
01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:42.931
I'm going to give them out when I get to the jungle.

1501
01:01:43.070 --> 01:01:45.170
Let's do this, The Law of Jungle!

1502
01:01:46.501 --> 01:01:47.840
- What is it? - They are hot packs.

1503
01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:49.670
I made them.

1504
01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:51.041
(They plan to stay warm with hot packs she made for them.)

1505
01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:53.811
- She drew them. - That's your face, Chief.

1506
01:01:54.110 --> 01:01:57.521
She made this. I can't believe it.

1507
01:01:57.681 --> 01:01:59.851
- Thank you. - Are those caricatures?

1508
01:01:59.851 --> 01:02:02.451
I could only think of the historical dramas you starred in.

1509
01:02:03.121 --> 01:02:04.121
This is me.

1510
01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:05.720
(A caricature for Seung Soo in a historical drama)

1511
01:02:06.621 --> 01:02:09.061
- Hey, this works. - It works.

1512
01:02:09.231 --> 01:02:10.701
- It works. It's warm. - It's working.

1513
01:02:10.701 --> 01:02:11.701
(It heats up as the liquid clots.)

1514
01:02:11.701 --> 01:02:12.900
I see. This is how it changes.

1515
01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:13.970
(It heats up as the liquid clots.)

1516
01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:16.501
Chae Yeon, this is really warm.

1517
01:02:16.501 --> 01:02:18.740
- This is amazing. It lasts so long. - I know. This is great.

1518
01:02:19.871 --> 01:02:21.041
- Thank you, Chae Yeon. - This is awesome.

1519
01:02:21.211 --> 01:02:22.771
- Thank you. - This is incredible.

1520
01:02:22.771 --> 01:02:24.141
Gosh, it's really warm.

1521
01:02:24.311 --> 01:02:27.311
Let us go to bed now.

1522
01:02:27.311 --> 01:02:29.110
I'm going to sleep on the end.

1523
01:02:30.621 --> 01:02:33.521
(The Tribe lies down in a temporary, cosy house.)

1524
01:02:33.521 --> 01:02:34.851
My gosh, it's so comfortable.

1525
01:02:35.121 --> 01:02:36.521
- Seriously. - Awesome.

1526
01:02:36.521 --> 01:02:37.720
It is.

1527
01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:40.331
- My arms can't reach. - I'm all the way on the end.

1528
01:02:40.530 --> 01:02:41.630
(The younger ones stay in the middle.)

1529
01:02:41.630 --> 01:02:43.331
Can you sleep over there?

1530
01:02:43.331 --> 01:02:44.400
(The older ones take the side.)

1531
01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:45.501
Can you sleep there?

1532
01:02:45.501 --> 01:02:46.530
(Clustered)

1533
01:02:51.070 --> 01:02:55.411
(Their first night in the jungle deepens with a shower.)

1534
01:02:55.641 --> 01:02:59.280
(The Tribe gets ready for tomorrow as they share each other's heat.)

1535
01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:06.621
(The day of their survival)

1536
01:03:08.851 --> 01:03:11.161
(The house is empty.)

1537
01:03:13.021 --> 01:03:15.291
(Where did everyone go?)

1538
01:03:18.161 --> 01:03:21.831
(It's too early to start their day.)

1539
01:03:21.831 --> 01:03:25.440
(Due to the cold weather, the Tribe has woken up early.)

1540
01:03:26.601 --> 01:03:29.271
(They make the fire which is dying.)

1541
01:03:31.411 --> 01:03:32.411
Last night was...

1542
01:03:32.411 --> 01:03:33.751
(Good dawn.)

1543
01:03:33.751 --> 01:03:35.780
You should've gotten more rest.

1544
01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:39.050
(The Chief's first order of business is...)

1545
01:03:39.050 --> 01:03:40.391
(drying his bottom.)

1546
01:03:40.391 --> 01:03:41.490
I'm drying my bottom.

1547
01:03:42.490 --> 01:03:45.320
(During the night, his bottom has gotten wet.)

1548
01:03:45.891 --> 01:03:49.260
At dawn, before I realized, the wind started...

1549
01:03:49.331 --> 01:03:51.760
- to come from above. - Right.

1550
01:03:51.931 --> 01:03:54.400
- It was gusty. - It was, wasn't it?

1551
01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:56.101
Right. We didn't have that first.

1552
01:03:56.331 --> 01:03:59.670
- We should cover the bottom. - Exactly.

1553
01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:03.840
(The sky is brightening.)

1554
01:04:04.581 --> 01:04:05.740
Good morning.

1555
01:04:06.110 --> 01:04:08.650
- Did you sleep well? - You're up.

1556
01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:10.121
(She's still half asleep.)

1557
01:04:10.121 --> 01:04:11.121
You're up.

1558
01:04:13.391 --> 01:04:16.690
But the view is breathtaking here.

1559
01:04:16.690 --> 01:04:17.690
(What a view.)

1560
01:04:18.021 --> 01:04:20.831
After surviving the bitter cold and hunger,

1561
01:04:21.030 --> 01:04:23.291
they face the first morning in Patagonia.

1562
01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:26.231
They enjoy the view only for a short while...

1563
01:04:26.601 --> 01:04:30.641
as they must head to their base camp going over the mountain.

1564
01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:33.340
Let's take this out, so we can collect the net.

1565
01:04:33.340 --> 01:04:35.871
- Okay. - We should take the net back.

1566
01:04:35.871 --> 01:04:38.141
- Let's recycle as much as we can. - Right.

1567
01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:41.510
We should get rid of the tinfoil after getting the net.

1568
01:04:43.150 --> 01:04:44.251
We can't use this?

1569
01:04:44.251 --> 01:04:45.351
(Tinfoil)

1570
01:04:45.851 --> 01:04:46.951
- Jin Young. - Really?

1571
01:04:46.951 --> 01:04:47.990
(String)

1572
01:04:47.990 --> 01:04:50.061
(They collect the net.)

1573
01:04:51.590 --> 01:04:52.760
Put these on the ground over there.

1574
01:04:53.190 --> 01:04:54.260
- That way? - Yes. There you go.

1575
01:04:55.030 --> 01:04:56.030
Let's take it out.

1576
01:04:56.190 --> 01:04:58.001
Hold on. Okay.

1577
01:05:01.630 --> 01:05:03.740
- This is good enough. - The sweet potato is all cooked.

1578
01:05:03.740 --> 01:05:04.771
That's our breakfast.

1579
01:05:07.041 --> 01:05:09.041
I just cooked it out of curiosity.

1580
01:05:09.041 --> 01:05:10.711
(The Chief roasted the stem they ate the day before.)

1581
01:05:10.711 --> 01:05:13.550
- My gosh, that's so interesting. - So the locals do eat this?

1582
01:05:14.110 --> 01:05:15.181
Yes.

1583
01:05:15.351 --> 01:05:16.581
Feed the younger ones first.

1584
01:05:16.581 --> 01:05:17.650
(Younger ones will taste first.)

1585
01:05:17.650 --> 01:05:19.220
- Don't be so greedy. - Okay.

1586
01:05:20.490 --> 01:05:24.690
(How will roasted nalca taste?)

1587
01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:28.961
- It tastes like a green apple. - This isn't bad, right?

1588
01:05:29.461 --> 01:05:32.101
Don't chew it a lot. When you chew just a bit, it's tasty.

1589
01:05:32.331 --> 01:05:33.400
- Really? - Yes.

1590
01:05:33.530 --> 01:05:34.871
It's not bad.

1591
01:05:34.871 --> 01:05:37.501
- I can taste acidic juice. - It is a bit sour,

1592
01:05:37.501 --> 01:05:39.271
but we can eat this when we are hungry.

1593
01:05:39.271 --> 01:05:40.271
(It can slightly sate their hunger.)

1594
01:05:41.311 --> 01:05:44.780
(The Chief takes a bite after feeding the younger ones.)

1595
01:05:46.211 --> 01:05:49.110
(It tastes terrible.)

1596
01:05:50.121 --> 01:05:52.550
(Frowning)

1597
01:05:53.121 --> 01:05:56.251
(It's bitter, sour, and unripe.)

1598
01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:59.291
(Perhaps, the Chief isn't that hungry yet.)

1599
01:05:59.291 --> 01:06:00.391
It was too close to the root.

1600
01:06:01.461 --> 01:06:02.490
It's not ripe.

1601
01:06:03.130 --> 01:06:05.360
Roasted salmon is the best thing ever...

1602
01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:06.871
if you roast it after drying it.

1603
01:06:06.871 --> 01:06:08.070
Let's eat that today.

1604
01:06:08.070 --> 01:06:09.070
(Let's eat that today.)

1605
01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:12.240
Sure. Okay.

1606
01:06:12.740 --> 01:06:13.811
Let's do that.

1607
01:06:14.010 --> 01:06:15.371
- Okay. I'll catch one. - From the mountain?

1608
01:06:15.641 --> 01:06:17.911
- Yes. - Let's catch something at least.

1609
01:06:18.740 --> 01:06:20.851
I really hope that we can survive...

1610
01:06:20.851 --> 01:06:22.751
- our time in a bigger base camp. - Right.

1611
01:06:22.751 --> 01:06:24.150
I feel reluctant to leave.

1612
01:06:24.681 --> 01:06:26.650
Isn't it too cold here?

1613
01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:29.951
- My teeth are aching. Seriously. - Gosh.

1614
01:06:31.621 --> 01:06:32.791
1, 2, 3.

1615
01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:34.360
Gosh, it's freezing.

1616
01:06:35.161 --> 01:06:36.360
I should get on it first.

1617
01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:37.400
(It will be the longest journey.)

1618
01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:38.461
The top is about to open.

1619
01:06:39.030 --> 01:06:41.630
My gosh, we have to get on a boat. We're getting on a boat.

1620
01:06:42.130 --> 01:06:43.131
Let's put our hands together.

1621
01:06:44.201 --> 01:06:46.240
Let's put our hands together. It's too cold.

1622
01:06:46.841 --> 01:06:47.940
Your hands are so warm.

1623
01:06:48.570 --> 01:06:49.810
We're off now.

1624
01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:51.480
Surviving on land, in the sea, and in the air.

1625
01:06:52.841 --> 01:06:56.180
(It's their 3rd day on the road. What kind of base camp is it?)

1626
01:06:57.121 --> 01:06:59.751
Aren't we riding the boat to the base camp...

1627
01:07:00.451 --> 01:07:03.051
because we're heading to an island?

1628
01:07:03.251 --> 01:07:05.360
If there was a way to reach there by land,

1629
01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:07.730
- we would've taken a car. - Right.

1630
01:07:07.730 --> 01:07:09.190
If we are taking the boat,

1631
01:07:09.591 --> 01:07:10.801
- Is it an island? - could it be an island?

1632
01:07:11.331 --> 01:07:14.430
I have a feeling that...

1633
01:07:14.430 --> 01:07:15.770
we'll go somewhere even colder.

1634
01:07:15.971 --> 01:07:17.600
We slept well at our last night's base camp.

1635
01:07:18.341 --> 01:07:20.411
- The staff asked if I slept well. - That's right.

1636
01:07:20.671 --> 01:07:23.511
The trip to the base camp is long.

1637
01:07:23.511 --> 01:07:26.480
And it makes me feel that things won't be nice for certain.

1638
01:07:27.251 --> 01:07:29.480
I think we're heading to an island just like you said.

1639
01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:30.680
(They make all kinds of guesses.)

1640
01:07:30.951 --> 01:07:34.690
(The boat that carries the Tribe continues on.)

1641
01:07:36.690 --> 01:07:38.961
This place feels like the Amazon.

1642
01:07:39.091 --> 01:07:41.360
- Right. - I agree.

1643
01:07:41.730 --> 01:07:42.890
This is just like the Amazon.

1644
01:07:42.890 --> 01:07:44.701
(On top of the Amazon River...)

1645
01:07:44.701 --> 01:07:46.730
I can see places from the world here.

1646
01:07:46.730 --> 01:07:48.570
Right. I can see everything.

1647
01:07:48.570 --> 01:07:51.501
I can see a mountain from Europe and a place from Asia.

1648
01:07:51.501 --> 01:07:54.140
This river really looks like the Amazon from Brazil.

1649
01:07:54.711 --> 01:07:56.411
- It's everything. - This place has everything.

1650
01:07:57.740 --> 01:08:00.110
- But why doesn't it have food? - Exactly.

1651
01:08:01.751 --> 01:08:02.810
It has everything, but food.

1652
01:08:03.751 --> 01:08:06.221
First of all, I had no idea that it was going to be that cold.

1653
01:08:06.221 --> 01:08:07.751
Besides the cold,

1654
01:08:07.751 --> 01:08:11.591
I thought that the war to hunt food had begun.

1655
01:08:12.591 --> 01:08:16.091
I thought if we were going to an island on a cold day like that.

1656
01:08:16.091 --> 01:08:17.360
(The weather makes them wince.)

1657
01:08:17.761 --> 01:08:18.801
Or I thought...

1658
01:08:18.801 --> 01:08:21.730
if we were going to a place where we can't reach by walking.

1659
01:08:22.471 --> 01:08:23.471
I was worried about that.

1660
01:08:25.740 --> 01:08:28.971
(The boat continues to head to the destination without taking a rest.)

1661
01:08:30.541 --> 01:08:33.951
(The Tribe doesn't lower their guard.)

1662
01:08:35.511 --> 01:08:38.680
(1 hour after they've been on the boat)

1663
01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:47.060
(The surrounding environment has changed again.)

1664
01:08:47.060 --> 01:08:50.831
(A mountain covered with ice cap comes into their sight.)

1665
01:08:52.001 --> 01:08:53.400
I see ice.

1666
01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:54.471
I see ice floating over there.

1667
01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:57.171
(Did he say, "ice"?)

1668
01:08:57.171 --> 01:08:59.301
- Over there. - I saw one over there.

1669
01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:00.341
(A white object is seen out the window.)

1670
01:09:00.341 --> 01:09:01.911
- Over there. - Yes, I see it too.

1671
01:09:02.971 --> 01:09:04.011
There are ice blocks here.

1672
01:09:04.011 --> 01:09:06.140
(Pieces of ice float around the water.)

1673
01:09:08.850 --> 01:09:10.381
You're right. I see more ice blocks.

1674
01:09:10.850 --> 01:09:11.881
There's one here too.

1675
01:09:11.881 --> 01:09:13.020
(The number begins to increase.)

1676
01:09:13.221 --> 01:09:14.621
I see more glaciers.

1677
01:09:15.490 --> 01:09:16.490
Exactly.

1678
01:09:17.890 --> 01:09:19.860
I wonder where they are coming from.

1679
01:09:19.860 --> 01:09:21.131
(The identity of glaciers that fill the sea is...)

1680
01:09:21.131 --> 01:09:22.161
I know, right?

1681
01:09:23.331 --> 01:09:24.701
I see big chunks now.

1682
01:09:24.701 --> 01:09:27.171
(The Tribe is heading to the origin of these glaciers.)

1683
01:09:29.570 --> 01:09:31.070
My gosh, they are...

1684
01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:33.270
They are getting bigger.

1685
01:09:33.971 --> 01:09:36.011
- Aren't the chunks getting bigger? - Yes, they are getting bigger.

1686
01:09:36.310 --> 01:09:38.740
- Right. What if we see icebergs? - My gosh.

1687
01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:39.740
(There might be icebergs now.)

1688
01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:41.751
(And a massive iceberg does show up before their eyes.)

1689
01:09:41.751 --> 01:09:44.051
- What's that? - It's an iceberg.

1690
01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:46.020
That's humongous.

1691
01:09:46.551 --> 01:09:47.551
It's massive.

1692
01:09:47.551 --> 01:09:48.690
(It's no comparison to their boat.)

1693
01:09:48.791 --> 01:09:50.221
But the colour is so pretty.

1694
01:09:50.221 --> 01:09:53.161
(The rich and grand appearance of the emerald iceberg)

1695
01:09:54.631 --> 01:09:56.761
(I must see something like this properly.)

1696
01:09:58.900 --> 01:10:01.270
(Their mouths drop.)

1697
01:10:02.631 --> 01:10:05.640
- Look at that. - I bet it tastes like soda.

1698
01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:07.041
I bet that it does.

1699
01:10:08.841 --> 01:10:10.081
- That's like a UFO. - Right.

1700
01:10:10.081 --> 01:10:12.480
- That looks like a UFO. - The UFO.

1701
01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:14.480
- This is amazing. - Doesn't it look like one?

1702
01:10:15.310 --> 01:10:17.551
(They are mesmerized by the sight alone.)

1703
01:10:17.551 --> 01:10:18.581
I can't believe this.

1704
01:10:19.081 --> 01:10:21.721
My gosh, hold on. This is...

1705
01:10:22.190 --> 01:10:24.390
The colour of the iceberg is starting to change.

1706
01:10:24.390 --> 01:10:25.520
Right. It's different.

1707
01:10:27.091 --> 01:10:29.091
- Is it melting? - Its colour became emerald.

1708
01:10:29.331 --> 01:10:32.761
I think that one must have been here longer.

1709
01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:35.001
Look at that one. It's so blue.

1710
01:10:35.701 --> 01:10:37.041
- What is that? - What is that?

1711
01:10:37.041 --> 01:10:38.900
- Hey, that is... - What is that?

1712
01:10:39.541 --> 01:10:41.310
I guess the glaciers are from there.

1713
01:10:42.471 --> 01:10:44.110
My gosh, I didn't know there was a ski resort in Chile.

1714
01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:46.541
It's too dangerous for us to go skiing on it.

1715
01:10:46.850 --> 01:10:50.051
- The glaciers must be from there. - I guess so.

1716
01:10:50.051 --> 01:10:52.650
Byung Man, are you sure it's safe for us to be here?

1717
01:10:52.650 --> 01:10:54.150
(San Rafael Glacier is 1 of 19 glaciers that make up Patagonia.)

1718
01:10:54.150 --> 01:10:56.251
We shouldn't be here, but they brought us here anyway.

1719
01:10:57.190 --> 01:10:58.221
We came to the wrong place.

1720
01:10:58.721 --> 01:11:01.591
- Seriously? - Blocks are spilling from there.

1721
01:11:01.990 --> 01:11:04.161
- You're right. I can see that too. - This is something...

1722
01:11:04.161 --> 01:11:06.461
- I only saw in documentaries. - Exactly.

1723
01:11:09.671 --> 01:11:12.541
Why do they keep stopping when there's no place to stop by?

1724
01:11:12.541 --> 01:11:14.940
- Gosh, the view is amazing. - We are trying to go round the ice.

1725
01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:15.940
Is that so?

1726
01:11:15.940 --> 01:11:18.711
My gosh, hold on. Something doesn't feel right.

1727
01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:20.751
I guess we can get off here.

1728
01:11:20.751 --> 01:11:22.551
(It's the boat the Tribe is on.)

1729
01:11:23.921 --> 01:11:25.180
Gosh, we got closer to there.

1730
01:11:27.490 --> 01:11:28.551
Hey, look.

1731
01:11:28.551 --> 01:11:30.320
(Collapsing)

1732
01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:33.060
- What was that? - I heard a glacier just collapsed.

1733
01:11:33.661 --> 01:11:37.030
(The icebergs sank after crashing into each other.)

1734
01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:39.360
(They get the chills.)

1735
01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:41.600
I heard the iceberg diving into the water after bumping into one.

1736
01:11:43.301 --> 01:11:45.841
- I'm scared. This is scary. - I'm scared.

1737
01:11:46.341 --> 01:11:47.940
Look at the icebergs.

1738
01:11:49.711 --> 01:11:52.841
It's about the base camp where you will start your survival.

(Survive on the glacier.)

1743
01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:04.390
Hold on.

1744
01:12:05.121 --> 01:12:06.690
- We need tools to do that. - What on earth...

1745
01:12:06.690 --> 01:12:08.560
How could we survive on that?

1746
01:12:08.890 --> 01:12:10.661
(It looks like it will freeze everything.)

1747
01:12:11.161 --> 01:12:13.501
- Sorry? - Even animals can't live on it.

1748
01:12:13.501 --> 01:12:16.971
There's nothing over there. There's no food we can live on.

1749
01:12:16.971 --> 01:12:18.801
- "No food". - How could we survive there?

1750
01:12:20.041 --> 01:12:22.770
I wondered how we would survive and make a house there.

1751
01:12:23.610 --> 01:12:26.140
I thought that something had gone wrong.

1752

(In despair)

1753
01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:29.650
I felt that we had a colossal problem.

1754
01:12:30.381 --> 01:12:32.280
I couldn't understand the staff at all.

1755
01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:35.221
I wondered what they wanted to achieve on that glacier.

1756
01:12:35.591 --> 01:12:37.860
I was at a loss for words and flustered.
