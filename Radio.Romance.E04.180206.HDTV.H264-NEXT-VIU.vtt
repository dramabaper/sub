1
00:00:07.436 --> 00:00:09.406
I did think about it before deciding,

2
00:00:09.537 --> 00:00:11.676
but you weren't a part of that consideration.

3
00:00:16.647 --> 00:00:19.187
But now, I am very concerned.

4
00:00:22.917 --> 00:00:24.757
Should I quit then?

5
00:00:36.867 --> 00:00:37.967
Pass.

6
00:00:38.236 --> 00:00:39.867
I apologize.

7
00:00:39.967 --> 00:00:42.537
I was afraid you were an idiot...

8
00:00:42.537 --> 00:00:44.306
who can't get angry even if you are mistreated,

9
00:00:44.306 --> 00:00:46.047
so I was testing you.

10
00:00:46.806 --> 00:00:48.516
I'm surprised.

11
00:00:48.717 --> 00:00:50.247
You know how to get angry,

12
00:00:50.247 --> 00:00:52.346
and you came without your manager.

13
00:00:52.986 --> 00:00:56.357
You're very different from what I had imagined.

14
00:00:56.927 --> 00:00:59.687
I'm not saying that's bad. I'm saying I like it.

15
00:01:02.056 --> 00:01:05.097
Look, we already know you're a total lunatic.

16
00:01:05.867 --> 00:01:06.966
Were you...

17
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:09.097
testing me?

18
00:01:09.196 --> 00:01:11.106
It wasn't really a test.

19
00:01:11.336 --> 00:01:13.936
I just wanted to see what emotions you have.

20
00:01:14.177 --> 00:01:16.836
You show zero emotions on your face.

21
00:01:18.477 --> 00:01:21.147
When we're doing the show, there will be...

22
00:01:21.147 --> 00:01:22.877
many unexpected situations.

23
00:01:23.017 --> 00:01:25.086
I also wanted to see how well you speak.

24
00:01:25.317 --> 00:01:27.886
So? How well do I speak?

25
00:01:28.086 --> 00:01:29.586
Did I pass in that field?

26
00:01:29.586 --> 00:01:33.056
Come on, guys. Stop that.

27
00:01:33.386 --> 00:01:34.657
Ji Soo Ho.

28
00:01:35.427 --> 00:01:38.166
I saw the contract you wrote.

29
00:01:38.166 --> 00:01:40.436
I was in awe.

30
00:01:41.636 --> 00:01:42.966
You're a professional.

31
00:01:43.097 --> 00:01:45.336
No wonder you're a top star.

32
00:01:45.567 --> 00:01:47.207
You're interested...

33
00:01:47.207 --> 00:01:49.237
in the script and the guests.

34
00:01:49.237 --> 00:01:51.407
You're a very detailed person.

35
00:01:51.407 --> 00:01:54.177
I saw how engaged you are in your work.

36
00:01:55.716 --> 00:01:56.716
Well?

37
00:01:57.246 --> 00:01:58.946
Did I interpret correctly?

38
00:01:59.617 --> 00:02:00.617
What if you did?

39
00:02:01.987 --> 00:02:02.987
I knew it.

40
00:02:03.317 --> 00:02:04.657
You're a professional.

41
00:02:07.427 --> 00:02:08.627
Hey, Newbie.

42
00:02:09.296 --> 00:02:10.997
Aren't you going to get your script lesson?

43
00:02:10.997 --> 00:02:12.266
How can you drink?

44
00:02:14.196 --> 00:02:15.196
- Right. - Bring it over.

45
00:02:24.407 --> 00:02:26.507
Let's have an official planning meeting...

46
00:02:26.676 --> 00:02:27.777
as professionals.

47
00:02:29.977 --> 00:02:31.986
Let's do it. As professionals.

48
00:02:31.986 --> 00:02:33.616
It'll be an overnight trip.

49
00:02:37.187 --> 00:02:39.027
An overnight trip?

50
00:02:39.187 --> 00:02:40.187
Yes.

51
00:02:40.356 --> 00:02:41.727
If you won't go,

52
00:02:41.727 --> 00:02:43.696
it'll be just Newbie and I.

53
00:02:43.766 --> 00:02:45.727
That would be meaningless.

54
00:02:48.636 --> 00:02:51.236
We're already stuck to each other all day.

55
00:03:00.916 --> 00:03:02.777
(Art Gallery)

56
00:03:02.777 --> 00:03:04.847
(Episode 4)

57
00:03:05.446 --> 00:03:07.356
My house is on the second floor.

58
00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:09.787
My house is over there.

59
00:03:10.727 --> 00:03:13.027
Do production directors and writers live close...

60
00:03:13.027 --> 00:03:14.227
in order to work these days?

61
00:03:14.757 --> 00:03:16.896
There is a vacancy on the third floor.

62
00:03:16.896 --> 00:03:18.366
Do you want to live close to us too?

63
00:03:19.696 --> 00:03:20.796
Ji Soo Ho,

64
00:03:21.037 --> 00:03:23.766
I look forward to getting really close tomorrow.

65
00:03:23.766 --> 00:03:25.907
Newbie and I must go work all night.

66
00:03:25.907 --> 00:03:27.007
All night?

67
00:03:28.407 --> 00:03:30.946
Your demands are high per your contract.

68
00:03:30.946 --> 00:03:32.606
We must be able to come up...

69
00:03:32.606 --> 00:03:35.116
with a script you will agree to.

70
00:03:35.317 --> 00:03:36.446
Let's go, Newbie.

71
00:03:36.546 --> 00:03:38.687
I'll come up after I see him off.

72
00:03:38.687 --> 00:03:39.687
Okay.

73
00:03:42.356 --> 00:03:43.356
Hey.

74
00:03:44.657 --> 00:03:46.557
Why do you keep calling her Newbie?

75
00:03:48.227 --> 00:03:50.196
Isn't she the main writer now?

76
00:03:51.627 --> 00:03:53.567
She'll always be a newbie to me.

77
00:04:07.516 --> 00:04:10.116
Is it all right for you to drive?

78
00:04:10.116 --> 00:04:11.687
Why wouldn't I be?

79
00:04:12.087 --> 00:04:15.287
Well... Didn't you drink?

80
00:04:15.516 --> 00:04:16.816
You had two shots.

81
00:04:16.816 --> 00:04:18.756
No, Mr. Lee stole your shot.

82
00:04:18.756 --> 00:04:19.957
While you were drinking one and a half shots,

83
00:04:19.957 --> 00:04:21.227
I didn't have any.

84
00:04:22.097 --> 00:04:23.097
I see.

85
00:04:23.397 --> 00:04:26.727
Also, Mr. Lee might look bizarre,

86
00:04:26.727 --> 00:04:29.637
but he's amazing. He's a talented man.

87
00:04:29.637 --> 00:04:31.006
If you just trust him and follow...

88
00:04:31.006 --> 00:04:33.037
Follow who?

89
00:04:34.936 --> 00:04:36.436
Close the door, will you?

90
00:04:37.676 --> 00:04:38.676
Okay.

91
00:04:39.207 --> 00:04:41.847
Also, I'll come pick you up tomorrow.

92
00:04:41.876 --> 00:04:44.517
I was strictly ordered to escort you.

93
00:04:45.017 --> 00:04:46.217
Drive safe.

94
00:04:53.727 --> 00:04:56.796
Why is he always so cranky with me?

95
00:05:07.077 --> 00:05:08.077
Hey,

96
00:05:08.207 --> 00:05:10.037
will it be like "One Night Two days"?

97
00:05:10.037 --> 00:05:11.207
Will we play games?

98
00:05:11.207 --> 00:05:13.777
Do we have to jump into the winter ocean?

99
00:05:13.777 --> 00:05:15.046
- What? - You said...

100
00:05:15.046 --> 00:05:16.777
the radio team is going on a trip.

101
00:05:16.777 --> 00:05:18.546
I have to prepare myself.

102
00:05:18.546 --> 00:05:19.986
What should I do for the talent show?

103
00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:21.756
Why are you coming?

104
00:05:21.957 --> 00:05:22.957
What?

105
00:05:23.356 --> 00:05:25.787
A doctor and a patient should get close.

106
00:05:25.787 --> 00:05:28.027
I decided to accompany you.

107
00:05:28.056 --> 00:05:30.227
I plan on getting close with Song Geu Rim too.

108
00:05:30.467 --> 00:05:32.197
- What? - Can you believe it?

109
00:05:32.666 --> 00:05:35.697
Ji Soo Ho is going on an overnight trip.

110
00:05:36.137 --> 00:05:37.907
Every time you make a grand decision,

111
00:05:37.907 --> 00:05:39.306
Song Geu Rim is behind it.

112
00:05:42.837 --> 00:05:44.847
What's the dress code for tomorrow?

113
00:05:46.407 --> 00:05:47.577
Thank you.

114
00:05:52.847 --> 00:05:54.856
That would be meaningless.

115
00:05:54.856 --> 00:05:57.457
We're already stuck to each other all day.

116
00:06:06.066 --> 00:06:07.666
My house is on the second floor.

117
00:06:07.796 --> 00:06:09.796
My house is over there.

118
00:06:09.936 --> 00:06:12.106
Newbie and I must go work all night.

119
00:06:13.066 --> 00:06:14.837
They're spending the night together?

120
00:06:19.506 --> 00:06:20.517
What am I doing?

121
00:06:43.707 --> 00:06:46.566
Why do you have so much luggage?

122
00:06:47.436 --> 00:06:48.436
Get in.

123
00:06:49.006 --> 00:06:50.277
I'll take my car.

124
00:06:50.847 --> 00:06:52.077
Great.

125
00:06:52.977 --> 00:06:53.977
Hey,

126
00:06:53.977 --> 00:06:55.876
you don't even know your way.

127
00:06:55.876 --> 00:06:58.087
It won't show up on the GPS anyway.

128
00:06:58.087 --> 00:06:59.087
Come on.

129
00:07:02.686 --> 00:07:03.727
Hurry up.

130
00:07:16.697 --> 00:07:17.707
So,

131
00:07:18.267 --> 00:07:19.606
where are we going?

132
00:07:19.606 --> 00:07:22.037
You'll see when you get there.

133
00:07:34.816 --> 00:07:38.387
Ms. Song, where are we going?

134
00:07:38.887 --> 00:07:41.327
To spend our "One Night Two Days"!

135
00:07:41.327 --> 00:07:42.426
We're almost there.

136
00:07:43.866 --> 00:07:45.467
"One Night Two Days"!

137
00:07:50.506 --> 00:07:51.566
"One Night"...

138
00:07:52.037 --> 00:07:53.407
Sorry.

139
00:08:16.556 --> 00:08:19.126
Don't tell me we're taking that ferry.

140
00:08:23.537 --> 00:08:24.537
Ji Soo Ho's...

141
00:08:24.537 --> 00:08:26.637
- "One Night Two Days"! - "One Night Two Days"!

142
00:08:27.977 --> 00:08:29.806
(We love you, Ji Soo Ho.)

143
00:08:29.806 --> 00:08:30.876
("One Night Two Days" with Ji Soo Ho)

144
00:08:30.876 --> 00:08:32.006
We love you.

145
00:08:32.006 --> 00:08:33.246
Let's go together.

146
00:08:34.616 --> 00:08:35.876
Do they sell this stuff?

147
00:08:36.917 --> 00:08:37.986
- All right. - Welcome.

148
00:08:37.986 --> 00:08:39.447
I think he kind of likes it.

149
00:08:39.447 --> 00:08:40.587
Let's go.

150
00:09:03.207 --> 00:09:04.376
Soo Ho,

151
00:09:04.746 --> 00:09:06.146
do you have motion sickness?

152
00:09:06.577 --> 00:09:08.246
You have been frowning,

153
00:09:08.246 --> 00:09:10.217
and your face is pale.

154
00:09:10.917 --> 00:09:11.917
I'm okay.

155
00:09:12.417 --> 00:09:14.457
Have this.

156
00:09:28.866 --> 00:09:29.866
Mr. Lee,

157
00:09:29.866 --> 00:09:31.406
- are you okay? - Drink this.

158
00:09:32.967 --> 00:09:35.177
Do we have a needle?

159
00:09:35.177 --> 00:09:36.177
In here?

160
00:09:40.347 --> 00:09:41.347
Here.

161
00:09:43.786 --> 00:09:44.817
Gosh.

162
00:09:49.417 --> 00:09:50.957
It's going to sting, okay?

163
00:09:52.656 --> 00:09:53.756
All right.

164
00:10:00.437 --> 00:10:02.036
Are you feeling better?

165
00:10:18.317 --> 00:10:19.717
This side, please.

166
00:10:45.376 --> 00:10:47.817
Why is Ji Soo Ho doing a radio show?

167
00:10:48.317 --> 00:10:50.786
Do they know his weakness?

168
00:10:51.886 --> 00:10:54.187
Why are you asking me?

169
00:10:54.616 --> 00:10:56.656
Ask Ms. Nam.

170
00:10:56.957 --> 00:10:58.986
Don't you know anything about that family?

171
00:11:00.427 --> 00:11:02.457
Why do you think I would know,

172
00:11:02.626 --> 00:11:03.626
Mr. Reporter?

173
00:11:03.626 --> 00:11:07.067
I know you've been friends with Soo Ho for 10 years.

174
00:11:07.067 --> 00:11:08.266
Ever since you were a child actress.

175
00:11:08.467 --> 00:11:11.506
I was his manager ever since he was a child.

176
00:11:12.006 --> 00:11:13.406
You can ask me.

177
00:11:13.906 --> 00:11:15.207
What are you curious about?

178
00:11:16.906 --> 00:11:20.077
Where is he right now?

179
00:11:20.276 --> 00:11:22.876
Why won't he show up to events these days?

180
00:11:22.876 --> 00:11:24.417
Could it be a family problem?

181
00:11:24.417 --> 00:11:26.146
I've been hearing rumors.

182
00:11:26.146 --> 00:11:27.256
Listen.

183
00:11:29.187 --> 00:11:31.256
If you write stories...

184
00:11:31.256 --> 00:11:33.386
according to every rumor you hear,

185
00:11:34.026 --> 00:11:37.496
you will fall down hard just like back then.

186
00:11:38.797 --> 00:11:40.797
Do you want us to break...

187
00:11:41.097 --> 00:11:42.736
your one remaining wing?

188
00:11:47.276 --> 00:11:49.677
There must be something big.

189
00:11:50.307 --> 00:11:53.177
Big enough to break my wing.

190
00:12:19.136 --> 00:12:20.376
Da Seul.

191
00:12:20.606 --> 00:12:21.606
Yes?

192
00:12:22.307 --> 00:12:24.776
How is it working with Soo Ho in the drama?

193
00:12:25.547 --> 00:12:26.746
Is everything well?

194
00:12:27.016 --> 00:12:28.246
Yes.

195
00:12:29.047 --> 00:12:30.986
Let's have dinner soon.

196
00:12:32.116 --> 00:12:33.317
All of us.

197
00:12:43.396 --> 00:12:44.967
What do we do?

198
00:13:01.616 --> 00:13:02.977
Let me hold it for a second.

199
00:13:04.187 --> 00:13:06.486
- What? - What is this?

200
00:13:06.717 --> 00:13:08.986
Hurry up and take it. Go on.

201
00:13:12.026 --> 00:13:14.356
Why do you keep on tagging along?

202
00:13:15.057 --> 00:13:17.927
Ms. Nam, Reporter An...

203
00:13:17.927 --> 00:13:19.996
keeps on asking me questions.

204
00:13:20.697 --> 00:13:22.597
He says that you have a show window family...

205
00:13:22.636 --> 00:13:25.136
and asks me why Soo Ho isn't at events.

206
00:13:25.167 --> 00:13:26.207
Things like that.

207
00:13:26.977 --> 00:13:29.177
If I tell him everything I know,

208
00:13:29.177 --> 00:13:31.906
that would make things awkward for you, right?

209
00:13:35.616 --> 00:13:38.286
So when will you get me together with him?

210
00:14:02.307 --> 00:14:05.246
We drove, then we rode a ferry.

211
00:14:05.406 --> 00:14:07.746
Now, we're waiting two hours for a bus?

212
00:14:07.917 --> 00:14:09.447
Why? For what?

213
00:14:09.677 --> 00:14:12.047
There is only one ferry a day to this place.

214
00:14:12.347 --> 00:14:14.217
The bus runs every two hours.

215
00:14:14.817 --> 00:14:17.656
The beauty of waiting is key to radio philosophy.

216
00:14:17.856 --> 00:14:21.026
Right now, we're experiencing it.

217
00:14:30.906 --> 00:14:33.106
The heart of a radio show is the sound.

218
00:14:33.837 --> 00:14:35.477
Did you know that, Soo Ho?

219
00:14:40.207 --> 00:14:42.246
If we leave the city,

220
00:14:42.246 --> 00:14:44.616
the sound around us changes completely.

221
00:14:45.246 --> 00:14:47.286
Have you ever felt it?

222
00:14:50.856 --> 00:14:53.057
I don't mean cars, alarms,

223
00:14:53.057 --> 00:14:56.256
and keyboards. It's a sound...

224
00:14:56.626 --> 00:14:59.026
you can only hear in nature.

225
00:15:02.766 --> 00:15:04.967
Sounds only humans can make.

226
00:15:06.236 --> 00:15:09.477
Radio is a place where such sounds are captured.

227
00:15:17.317 --> 00:15:20.087
Soo Ho, we're almost there.

228
00:15:20.687 --> 00:15:22.656
Hurry up. That's cold.

229
00:15:24.427 --> 00:15:25.486
Are you serious?

230
00:15:26.486 --> 00:15:28.197
I'll get you.

231
00:15:34.097 --> 00:15:35.337
What is this?

232
00:15:38.667 --> 00:15:39.866
Hey!

233
00:15:54.457 --> 00:15:55.717
Namaste.

234
00:15:55.986 --> 00:15:58.126
Stop it. Okay, we won't.

235
00:15:58.156 --> 00:16:00.297
Stop it. We won't. I'm sorry.

236
00:16:02.356 --> 00:16:03.396
Hey!

237
00:16:05.327 --> 00:16:06.766
You want to play too, right?

238
00:16:18.307 --> 00:16:20.146
- Isn't it nice? - Yes.

239
00:16:21.016 --> 00:16:22.077
It's nice.

240
00:16:23.817 --> 00:16:26.347
What is your strength?

241
00:16:26.786 --> 00:16:28.557
- Face? - Smile?

242
00:16:28.687 --> 00:16:30.656
- Acting? - In radio,

243
00:16:30.656 --> 00:16:32.927
you don't need a face, and you shouldn't act.

244
00:16:33.256 --> 00:16:34.797
Do you have anything else?

245
00:16:36.097 --> 00:16:37.526
Let's unpack.

246
00:16:37.526 --> 00:16:40.496
We'll have a meeting since it's Soo Ho's favorite.

247
00:16:40.837 --> 00:16:42.396
Guys on this side, girls on that side.

248
00:16:42.736 --> 00:16:43.766
Okay.

249
00:16:55.646 --> 00:16:57.847
- Is this... - It's the men's room.

250
00:16:59.016 --> 00:17:01.817
We'll spend the night here together.

251
00:17:02.986 --> 00:17:04.556
No, my laptop bag!

252
00:17:04.887 --> 00:17:05.957
Mr. Lee!

253
00:17:06.157 --> 00:17:08.596
- What do we do? Mr. Lee! - My gosh.

254
00:17:09.127 --> 00:17:10.227
What is it?

255
00:17:12.266 --> 00:17:14.296
Mr. Lee, I think...

256
00:17:14.296 --> 00:17:16.697
I left the laptop bag on the ferry.

257
00:17:16.697 --> 00:17:17.766
And?

258
00:17:17.766 --> 00:17:19.607
I'll go back to the dock to find it.

259
00:17:20.066 --> 00:17:22.877
The script and research materials...

260
00:17:23.076 --> 00:17:24.246
I'll come with you.

261
00:17:24.306 --> 00:17:27.246
- Hun Jung, I'll go and... - No, no.

262
00:17:27.346 --> 00:17:30.316
You can start the meeting without me.

263
00:17:35.857 --> 00:17:37.387
Are you stupid?

264
00:17:39.326 --> 00:17:41.897
Yes. Is this Chungwoon Dock?

265
00:17:42.096 --> 00:17:44.727
Did anyone find a laptop bag?

266
00:17:47.496 --> 00:17:48.697
You're not sure?

267
00:17:51.437 --> 00:17:54.937
Seriously! There are no taxis here.

268
00:17:55.336 --> 00:17:56.506
What do I do?

269
00:17:59.806 --> 00:18:02.046
Excuse me! Sir!

270
00:18:03.117 --> 00:18:04.647
Sir, wait.

271
00:18:06.387 --> 00:18:07.516
Where are you going?

272
00:18:07.756 --> 00:18:10.526
Are you going to the docks?

273
00:18:11.457 --> 00:18:14.596
Could you drop me off somewhere nearby?

274
00:18:15.127 --> 00:18:17.766
Or anywhere you're going?

275
00:18:18.967 --> 00:18:20.836
Please, sir.

276
00:18:21.137 --> 00:18:22.236
Get on then.

277
00:18:22.897 --> 00:18:25.167
Thank you. Thank you.

278
00:18:31.647 --> 00:18:32.806
Soo Ho.

279
00:18:36.177 --> 00:18:37.346
Why...

280
00:18:37.687 --> 00:18:38.717
You forgot your bag...

281
00:18:38.717 --> 00:18:40.917
because you were too busy taking care of Mr. Lee.

282
00:18:41.516 --> 00:18:44.687
Wait, sir. Hurry up and get off.

283
00:18:44.756 --> 00:18:46.286
- The meeting... - It's a brown bag.

284
00:18:46.357 --> 00:18:48.697
- It had a doll on it. - Yes.

285
00:18:49.157 --> 00:18:50.727
Mr. Lee, are you okay?

286
00:18:50.727 --> 00:18:52.566
I saw you get off without the bag.

287
00:18:55.897 --> 00:18:59.207
And you didn't tell me?

288
00:19:01.036 --> 00:19:03.036
Why are you coming with me?

289
00:19:03.076 --> 00:19:04.276
To go home.

290
00:19:04.677 --> 00:19:05.806
What?

291
00:19:32.907 --> 00:19:34.036
Hey, Soo Ho.

292
00:19:51.457 --> 00:19:54.197
How can you go home? There are no ferries.

293
00:19:57.066 --> 00:19:59.667
Also, if you came to sleep over,

294
00:19:59.667 --> 00:20:01.566
then you should stay.

295
00:20:13.246 --> 00:20:14.516
Thank you.

296
00:20:22.387 --> 00:20:24.756
You still haven't figured out where he is?

297
00:20:25.457 --> 00:20:26.486
Not yet.

298
00:20:35.137 --> 00:20:37.407
Proceed the meeting with director Kim Sang Soo.

299
00:20:37.407 --> 00:20:41.137
The schedule will change if Soo Ho starts radio.

300
00:20:41.536 --> 00:20:42.637
Will it be all right?

301
00:20:42.907 --> 00:20:44.207
"Will it be all right?"

302
00:20:45.076 --> 00:20:46.917
Did you just ask me that?

303
00:20:47.846 --> 00:20:51.086
I treat you better than any other companies.

304
00:20:51.546 --> 00:20:54.687
Why is it that I don't get the answers I want?

305
00:20:55.187 --> 00:20:56.357
Both of you.

306
00:21:00.227 --> 00:21:02.526
Keep an eye on Jin Tae Ri.

307
00:21:02.897 --> 00:21:05.596
Report to me if you find anything. You can go.

308
00:21:05.996 --> 00:21:07.066
Yes, ma'am.

309
00:21:13.137 --> 00:21:15.576
If we don't want Soo Ho to do the radio show,

310
00:21:16.506 --> 00:21:19.977
we can just make Song Geu Rim quit her job.

311
00:21:21.576 --> 00:21:23.076
Did you figure out how to go about it?

312
00:21:28.187 --> 00:21:29.457
From what I saw on the proposal,

313
00:21:29.457 --> 00:21:31.326
there's a team competing against Soo Ho.

314
00:21:32.427 --> 00:21:34.157
The writer's name was La La Hee, I think?

315
00:21:34.627 --> 00:21:36.857
Gang's team went away for a planning retreat.

316
00:21:48.107 --> 00:21:49.137
What about us?

317
00:21:49.907 --> 00:21:52.576
What should our concept be?

318
00:21:55.046 --> 00:21:57.617
Do you have any DJs or concepts in mind?

319
00:21:58.286 --> 00:21:59.717
Obviously not.

320
00:22:00.617 --> 00:22:01.617
Hey.

321
00:22:01.917 --> 00:22:05.086
Do you not have any ability for planning...

322
00:22:05.086 --> 00:22:07.556
or drive whatsoever?

323
00:22:07.657 --> 00:22:08.957
Please,

324
00:22:09.657 --> 00:22:11.066
address me properly.

325
00:22:11.867 --> 00:22:13.296
Your old habits are still there.

326
00:22:14.937 --> 00:22:18.066
Old habits? Should I talk about old habits?

327
00:22:18.766 --> 00:22:19.766
Should I?

328
00:22:24.707 --> 00:22:26.447
I've been looking at green things...

329
00:22:26.447 --> 00:22:28.217
to calm my temper lately.

330
00:22:28.776 --> 00:22:30.816
So let's not fight...

331
00:22:34.286 --> 00:22:36.286
get along, okay?

332
00:22:41.857 --> 00:22:43.357
Yes, hello?

333
00:22:46.397 --> 00:22:47.566
JH?

334
00:22:50.467 --> 00:22:52.937
(Tickets)

335
00:22:56.236 --> 00:22:59.677
Excuse me. I left my laptop bag on the boat.

336
00:22:59.677 --> 00:23:02.417
It's about 50cm by 30cm.

337
00:23:02.417 --> 00:23:04.586
There's a cute doll dangling from it.

338
00:23:04.586 --> 00:23:06.217
Yes. Just a minute.

339
00:23:08.086 --> 00:23:10.427
- Here. - Thank you.

340
00:23:18.197 --> 00:23:21.266
Are you sure there's only one boat a day?

341
00:23:21.266 --> 00:23:22.266
Yes.

342
00:23:22.397 --> 00:23:23.806
What if there's an emergency,

343
00:23:23.806 --> 00:23:25.607
and you need to get off the island?

344
00:23:25.607 --> 00:23:27.236
You can't.

345
00:23:33.816 --> 00:23:34.977
Thank goodness.

346
00:23:34.977 --> 00:23:37.746
I have the script that you're going to read.

347
00:23:47.526 --> 00:23:49.056
Is that so important?

348
00:23:49.857 --> 00:23:51.627
Of course.

349
00:23:51.826 --> 00:23:55.496
They're all my scripts that I ever wrote.

350
00:23:56.197 --> 00:23:58.336
And I couldn't back up...

351
00:23:58.336 --> 00:24:00.306
your first show.

352
00:24:01.377 --> 00:24:02.536
We're saved.

353
00:24:13.286 --> 00:24:14.286
But...

354
00:24:14.556 --> 00:24:16.717
you weren't planning to go home, were you?

355
00:24:17.357 --> 00:24:18.357
What?

356
00:24:18.357 --> 00:24:20.857
Look. You didn't even bring your stuff.

357
00:24:21.127 --> 00:24:23.357
You came because you were worried about me, right?

358
00:24:24.596 --> 00:24:25.697
I did not.

359
00:24:25.996 --> 00:24:28.667
I couldn't leave because there's no beat.

360
00:24:29.096 --> 00:24:30.667
Don't be absurd.

361
00:24:33.236 --> 00:24:34.836
Here it is.

362
00:24:34.877 --> 00:24:36.506
The bus is here.

363
00:24:51.627 --> 00:24:54.957
It must have been a while since you rode the bus.

364
00:24:55.357 --> 00:24:57.266
If you were in a car,

365
00:24:57.266 --> 00:24:59.167
or in a van with tinted windows,

366
00:24:59.167 --> 00:25:01.667
you couldn't see a view like this.

367
00:25:02.266 --> 00:25:04.236
It may take longer,

368
00:25:04.566 --> 00:25:07.306
but when else would you get to enjoy this view?

369
00:25:08.036 --> 00:25:09.036
Right?

370
00:26:10.707 --> 00:26:12.806
The radio is super slow as well.

371
00:26:13.776 --> 00:26:16.407
Just like this slow bus,

372
00:26:16.977 --> 00:26:19.306
just like that sunset that is following us,

373
00:26:19.707 --> 00:26:20.947
it is very slow.

374
00:26:23.177 --> 00:26:25.246
That's why I like the radio.

375
00:26:54.177 --> 00:26:57.246
Sir. Where are we?

376
00:26:57.387 --> 00:26:59.016
Is it much farther to Donggong-ri?

377
00:26:59.217 --> 00:27:01.316
What? Donggong-ri?

378
00:27:01.917 --> 00:27:03.556
That's in the opposite direction.

379
00:27:04.026 --> 00:27:07.127
The bus in the opposite direction stopped running.

380
00:27:07.526 --> 00:27:08.526
What?

381
00:27:24.107 --> 00:27:25.977
What is this mess?

382
00:27:25.977 --> 00:27:28.246
Why do these things always happen when I'm with...

383
00:27:33.986 --> 00:27:36.086
Don't you worry.

384
00:27:36.387 --> 00:27:38.486
I'll call Mr. Lee and...

385
00:27:46.526 --> 00:27:47.697
Thank you.

386
00:27:49.197 --> 00:27:50.766
I'll call him.

387
00:27:52.467 --> 00:27:54.736
But... Where are we?

388
00:27:54.736 --> 00:27:57.177
(Sung Yi's Bed and Breakfast)

389
00:28:12.727 --> 00:28:14.026
Soo Ho.

390
00:28:15.826 --> 00:28:17.526
Are you okay?

391
00:28:17.526 --> 00:28:20.096
Yes, I'm... I'm fine.

392
00:28:27.907 --> 00:28:28.937
Who are you?

393
00:28:30.677 --> 00:28:31.746
You're back.

394
00:28:32.647 --> 00:28:34.046
You're finally back.

395
00:28:39.486 --> 00:28:40.516
Thank you.

396
00:28:40.917 --> 00:28:41.986
I've...

397
00:28:43.486 --> 00:28:46.927
waited every single day for you to come.

398
00:29:24.526 --> 00:29:25.627
Hello, Mr. Lee.

399
00:29:25.927 --> 00:29:28.036
I'm with Soo Ho right now.

400
00:29:28.036 --> 00:29:30.607
Something came up, so we came somewhere.

401
00:29:30.607 --> 00:29:31.667
You punk!

402
00:29:32.536 --> 00:29:33.776
Look at the time.

403
00:29:34.006 --> 00:29:35.607
Do you know how worried I was?

404
00:29:35.877 --> 00:29:38.306
Why weren't you calling?

405
00:29:38.647 --> 00:29:40.177
I'm sorry.

406
00:29:40.576 --> 00:29:41.816
After I found my bag,

407
00:29:41.816 --> 00:29:43.917
I didn't realize the bus came from the other side.

408
00:29:45.717 --> 00:29:47.387
Where are you? What's the address?

409
00:29:48.016 --> 00:29:49.586
Well... Where am I?

410
00:29:50.256 --> 00:29:51.826
Just a minute.

411
00:29:55.397 --> 00:29:57.326
- Let's go. - Excuse me.

412
00:29:57.326 --> 00:29:58.796
I'll call you back.

413
00:30:00.397 --> 00:30:03.496
We should at least say bye to him first.

414
00:30:03.496 --> 00:30:06.236
Hey. No! You can't go! You can't go!

415
00:30:06.236 --> 00:30:07.377
You can't go!

416
00:30:07.377 --> 00:30:09.076
You can't go.

417
00:30:09.536 --> 00:30:11.177
You can't go!

418
00:30:11.977 --> 00:30:14.246
You said you'd be back when you left before,

419
00:30:14.246 --> 00:30:16.246
and you didn't come back until now.

420
00:30:16.377 --> 00:30:18.986
You can't go. You can't!

421
00:30:20.387 --> 00:30:21.387
Let's go in.

422
00:30:21.516 --> 00:30:23.217
- Sir... - Let's go in!

423
00:30:23.217 --> 00:30:25.127
Go in.

424
00:30:25.687 --> 00:30:26.687
Okay.

425
00:30:29.227 --> 00:30:30.996
Is Soo Ho with Ms. Song?

426
00:30:37.707 --> 00:30:39.367
Is he or not?

427
00:30:40.036 --> 00:30:41.036
Here.

428
00:30:41.977 --> 00:30:43.107
Here.

429
00:30:43.506 --> 00:30:45.107
Eat up.

430
00:30:54.957 --> 00:30:57.326
Okay. Slowly. Slowly.

431
00:30:57.326 --> 00:30:58.927
Dip it in the salt.

432
00:30:59.026 --> 00:31:01.457
Slowly. Eat slowly, and eat a lot.

433
00:31:03.096 --> 00:31:04.867
Here. Hey.

434
00:31:04.927 --> 00:31:06.397
Don't touch.

435
00:31:07.496 --> 00:31:09.867
You can eat the neck.

436
00:31:09.937 --> 00:31:11.266
It's tender and delicious.

437
00:31:11.266 --> 00:31:12.336
Eat up.

438
00:31:13.137 --> 00:31:14.607
Go on. Eat up.

439
00:31:15.207 --> 00:31:16.207
Anyway,

440
00:31:16.377 --> 00:31:19.607
does Soo Ho look that much like your son?

441
00:31:19.977 --> 00:31:21.377
He is my son.

442
00:31:21.377 --> 00:31:23.786
What's wrong with you?

443
00:31:24.947 --> 00:31:25.986
Anyway,

444
00:31:26.346 --> 00:31:28.586
are you my son's girlfriend?

445
00:31:30.927 --> 00:31:33.187
No. I am not.

446
00:31:33.556 --> 00:31:35.596
I'm not his girlfriend.

447
00:31:35.756 --> 00:31:38.526
You're not? Okay. Here, eat.

448
00:31:39.397 --> 00:31:40.566
Does it taste okay?

449
00:31:40.766 --> 00:31:42.967
Yes, it tastes good.

450
00:31:43.566 --> 00:31:45.467
You'll stay the night, right?

451
00:31:45.967 --> 00:31:47.006
Right?

452
00:31:48.937 --> 00:31:50.207
Eat up.

453
00:31:52.947 --> 00:31:56.776
So, I think we'll have to stay the night.

454
00:31:57.617 --> 00:32:01.417
Yes. He won't let Soo Ho go,

455
00:32:01.687 --> 00:32:03.316
and there are no buses.

456
00:32:05.526 --> 00:32:08.796
I'm sorry. We can't hold our meeting because of me.

457
00:32:09.296 --> 00:32:12.026
It's fine. Be careful not to catch a cold.

458
00:32:12.026 --> 00:32:13.096
See you tomorrow.

459

That's what I want. What's it to you?

defines my job.

472

Thus, I fight for him, not for me.

That's my role.

You're his manager,

477
00:34:09.516 --> 00:34:11.386
but you abandoned him 12 years ago.

478

Well... Sir,

480
00:34:34.277 --> 00:34:36.676
did you keep sending postcards to radio shows?

These are the ones I didn't mail yet.

484

What are you doing out here?

494
00:36:26.846 --> 00:36:30.187
I was sleeping, but a roach this big came out.

495
00:36:30.587 --> 00:36:31.957
It woke me right up.

496
00:36:32.156 --> 00:36:34.257
I figured I'd edit my script.

Still, what if...

498
00:36:37.067 --> 00:36:38.527
you catch a cold?

499
00:36:39.266 --> 00:36:40.966
I'm too scared to go in.

500
00:36:41.036 --> 00:36:43.607
Will you catch it for me?

501
00:36:43.607 --> 00:36:44.766
Are you insane?

502
00:36:48.806 --> 00:36:50.076
Actually, Soo Ho.

503

reads from my script.

Do you know this song?

512
00:37:29.346 --> 00:37:31.116
Here. It's cold.

513
00:37:44.727 --> 00:37:46.266
Do you know...

514
00:37:47.096 --> 00:37:50.737
what song request comes in the most on rainy days?

515
00:37:53.707 --> 00:37:55.507
When the song I want to hear...

516
00:37:55.777 --> 00:37:58.047
is played because someone requested it,

517
00:37:58.377 --> 00:38:00.346
it is so comforting.

518
00:38:02.446 --> 00:38:03.786
Do you know how that feels?

519
00:38:10.487 --> 00:38:12.227
What is he like?

520
00:38:14.696 --> 00:38:16.656
(1:1 confidential consultations)

521
00:38:17.266 --> 00:38:18.596
This is what I do.

522
00:38:21.636 --> 00:38:23.096
Come on.

523
00:38:27.176 --> 00:38:29.806
No, not you. Soo Ho.

524
00:38:37.987 --> 00:38:39.386
This is what I do, so...

525
00:38:42.487 --> 00:38:43.957
I'm more curious.

526
00:38:44.386 --> 00:38:46.357
Why did you cast Soo Ho as your DJ?

527
00:38:46.357 --> 00:38:48.297
You don't know what he's like.

528
00:38:48.627 --> 00:38:51.696
There's an Arabic word, "inshallah."

529
00:38:51.797 --> 00:38:53.067
God willing.

530
00:38:53.127 --> 00:38:55.397
That's sort of how it happened.

531
00:38:57.966 --> 00:39:01.507
I'd like to invite you into the booth,

532
00:39:01.977 --> 00:39:03.507
our confidential therapist.

533
00:39:05.047 --> 00:39:06.507
- Me? - Yes.

534
00:39:07.647 --> 00:39:10.346
- Inshallah. - Inshallah.

535
00:39:17.587 --> 00:39:20.087
Soo Ho couldn't drink at all.

536
00:42:41.397 --> 00:42:45.866
(Calling Joon Woo)

537
00:44:03.906 --> 00:44:05.277
Sir.

538
00:44:05.576 --> 00:44:07.246
Where's Soo Ho?

539
00:44:10.446 --> 00:44:11.946
He left again.

540
00:44:14.386 --> 00:44:15.687
He left without a word.

541
00:44:25.366 --> 00:44:26.766
Ms. Song!

542
00:44:29.797 --> 00:44:31.136
Soo Ho isn't here, is he?

543
00:44:31.266 --> 00:44:32.337
Did you sleep well?

544
00:44:32.707 --> 00:44:33.837
I was worried.

545
00:44:34.036 --> 00:44:36.136
Where did Soo Ho go?

546
00:44:36.406 --> 00:44:39.076
I couldn't find him anywhere this morning.

547
00:44:41.576 --> 00:44:43.547
They say this is the first boat.

548
00:44:43.547 --> 00:44:45.446
He must still be somewhere on the island.

549
00:44:50.786 --> 00:44:51.857
Anyway,

550
00:44:51.857 --> 00:44:54.397
why doesn't Soo Ho carry a cell phone?

551
00:45:09.237 --> 00:45:10.576
You don't even have a cell phone,

552
00:45:11.176 --> 00:45:12.547
but you remembered my number.

553
00:45:13.076 --> 00:45:14.777
How could I not remember?

554
00:45:16.547 --> 00:45:17.547
That day...

555
00:45:20.317 --> 00:45:22.987
I called you dozens of times.

556
00:45:38.306 --> 00:45:39.366
Soo Ho.

557
00:45:42.437 --> 00:45:43.777
If you hate me that much,

558
00:45:44.047 --> 00:45:45.547
I'll quit.

559
00:45:45.977 --> 00:45:47.277
Get a new manager.

560
00:45:48.616 --> 00:45:49.616
You...

561
00:45:49.946 --> 00:45:51.987
are an actor who needs a manager.

562
00:45:52.817 --> 00:45:54.687
Don't suffer because of me.

563
00:45:54.687 --> 00:45:55.687
Really?

564
00:45:56.216 --> 00:45:57.687
Do you really want to quit?

565
00:46:00.596 --> 00:46:01.596
See?

566
00:46:02.357 --> 00:46:04.866
You can't even answer the follow-up question.

567
00:46:08.067 --> 00:46:09.067
Bye.

568
00:46:22.516 --> 00:46:23.547
Welcome home, sir.

569
00:46:28.687 --> 00:46:29.957
Give me 30 minutes.

570
00:46:30.727 --> 00:46:32.286
Let's have our meeting after 30 minutes.

571
00:46:33.127 --> 00:46:34.196
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

572
00:47:20.607 --> 00:47:22.277
I called you here...

573
00:47:22.277 --> 00:47:24.306
to offer you my support.

574
00:47:25.607 --> 00:47:28.446
If there is a DJ or guest that you want,

575
00:47:28.647 --> 00:47:31.216
JH will support you with what you need.

576
00:47:31.987 --> 00:47:33.346
Why is that?

577
00:47:33.346 --> 00:47:35.516
If you need advertisers or sponsors,

578
00:47:35.656 --> 00:47:38.487
we can help you with that as well.

579
00:47:41.457 --> 00:47:43.056
But I have a condition.

580
00:47:43.866 --> 00:47:46.527
A condition? What condition...

581
00:47:46.527 --> 00:47:48.136
I'm looking at one month.

582
00:47:49.966 --> 00:47:51.266
One month?

583
00:47:51.266 --> 00:47:53.777
If I support you,

584
00:47:53.777 --> 00:47:56.406
can you get Song Geu Rim to quit...

585
00:47:57.076 --> 00:47:58.576
in a month?

586
00:48:03.176 --> 00:48:05.547
I'd prefer that Soo Ho work with a writer...

587
00:48:05.547 --> 00:48:09.087
who is experienced and respected like you.

588
00:48:10.087 --> 00:48:12.386

591
00:48:20.437 --> 00:48:21.996
you may face in the radio booth,

592
00:48:21.996 --> 00:48:23.866

This is the script for the first episode.

595
00:48:40.216 --> 00:48:42.417
I knew you'd do this,

596
00:48:42.987 --> 00:48:44.826
but it makes me mad actually seeing you here.

597
00:48:47.457 --> 00:48:49.426
You should've said you were leaving.

598
00:48:49.426 --> 00:48:51.067
Do you know how worried I was?

599
00:48:57.636 --> 00:48:58.937
This was the first time...

600
00:48:58.937 --> 00:49:00.636
I wished you'd get a cell phone.

601
00:49:14.257 --> 00:49:16.016
Really?

602
00:49:16.817 --> 00:49:18.527
Thank goodness.

603
00:49:18.527 --> 00:49:19.987
I was very worried.

604
00:49:23.496 --> 00:49:24.797
I don't get it.

605
00:49:25.067 --> 00:49:27.196
Why did he go alone without saying anything?

606
00:49:27.266 --> 00:49:28.567
I don't know.

607
00:49:28.996 --> 00:49:31.237
You should ask him yourself later.

608
00:49:32.707 --> 00:49:33.777
Okay.

609
00:49:35.076 --> 00:49:37.047
Would you let him know...

610
00:49:37.047 --> 00:49:38.806
that I emailed him the proposal...

611
00:49:38.806 --> 00:49:40.246
and the script?

612
00:49:40.477 --> 00:49:42.116
Please ask him to review them.

613
00:49:43.147 --> 00:49:44.187
Okay, bye.

614

Soo Ho. You really are impossible to read.

621

you should read your script aloud, right?

00:50:24.326 --> 00:50:27.326

The circulation in an invisible world.

Okay, everyone. Are you ready?

- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

00:53:30.777 --> 00:53:32.877
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

662

Okay. Let's go.

663
00:53:52.766 --> 00:53:53.837
Are you scared?

664

Yes.

667

I've waited so long for this moment,

668
00:54:05.306 --> 00:54:07.647
and that makes me even more afraid.

669

- Newbie. - Yes?

670
00:54:13.087 --> 00:54:15.516
There were only three types of writers...

671
00:54:15.516 --> 00:54:17.727
that I've ever met at a radio station.

672
00:54:18.156 --> 00:54:21.696
They write scripts well, have good ideas,

673
00:54:21.696 --> 00:54:23.297
or are good at getting guests.

674

00:55:03.237 --> 00:55:05.567
I was too nervous to sleep last night.

682
00:55:05.766 --> 00:55:06.766
Thank you.

683
00:55:10.246 --> 00:55:12.246
Please say something to your fans.

684
00:55:12.246 --> 00:55:13.817
How do you feel right now?

685
00:55:13.817 --> 00:55:15.216
A word please!

686
00:55:15.216 --> 00:55:16.746
Please!

687
00:55:16.877 --> 00:55:19.116
- A word! - Please say something!

688
00:55:19.116 --> 00:55:20.987
- Look this way! - Over here!

689
00:55:27.627 --> 00:55:29.156
Coming through. Excuse us.

690
00:55:30.797 --> 00:55:32.466
He looks so hot.

691
00:55:32.466 --> 00:55:33.937
Look at him.

692
00:55:34.297 --> 00:55:37.036
His face is seriously a work of art.

693
00:55:38.707 --> 00:55:40.676
I can stare at him all day.

694
00:56:07.866 --> 00:56:10.507
I read this once in a book.

695
00:56:14.176 --> 00:56:16.507
Every time we let out a sigh,

696
00:56:16.877 --> 00:56:19.246
a little bit of happiness escapes.

697
00:56:19.246 --> 00:56:20.777
(Do you want to take a trip?)

698
00:56:23.047 --> 00:56:25.786
In a packed subway, when your boss nags you,

699
00:56:26.317 --> 00:56:28.457
when you have to work late once again...

700
00:56:29.786 --> 00:56:30.957
How many times...

701
00:56:31.286 --> 00:56:33.386
- will we sigh today? - Ms. Song.

702
00:56:33.487 --> 00:56:35.196
It's different from your script.

703
00:56:35.196 --> 00:56:38.366
Did he really write a brand-new script?

704
00:56:47.437 --> 00:56:50.007
How about we smile instead during those moments...

705
00:56:50.477 --> 00:56:52.806
when we want to sigh?

706
00:56:54.346 --> 00:56:55.516
Who knows?

707
00:56:56.216 --> 00:56:57.987
Every time we smile,

708
00:56:58.516 --> 00:57:00.786
happiness may come to us.

709
00:57:01.616 --> 00:57:03.656
We will begin Ji Soo Ho's Radio Romance...

710
00:57:03.656 --> 00:57:06.786
with a song to make you smile.

711
00:57:12.797 --> 00:57:14.797
He's going with the song we chose.

712
00:57:19.607 --> 00:57:21.837
Nice song selection.

713
00:57:22.576 --> 00:57:25.946
Geu Rim. The opening comment was awesome.

714
00:57:29.777 --> 00:57:32.487
Applause. Nice.

715
00:57:56.837 --> 00:57:58.746
Okay, applause.

716
00:58:00.817 --> 00:58:03.716
It's like you were born to be on the radio.

717
00:58:03.817 --> 00:58:06.187
How are you such a natural?

718
00:58:06.246 --> 00:58:08.457
It's all thanks to Mr. Lee and Ms. Song.

719
00:58:09.757 --> 00:58:11.227
You're so modest.

720
00:58:19.527 --> 00:58:22.297
I really want to shake your hand right now.

721
00:58:24.437 --> 00:58:26.266
You did great today.

722
00:58:27.937 --> 00:58:30.107
You did a great job.

723
00:58:30.446 --> 00:58:32.246
Get home safely.

724
00:58:36.777 --> 00:58:39.346
He's so clueless.

725
00:58:39.346 --> 00:58:42.857
Why don't we all go out for dinner to celebrate?

726
00:58:42.857 --> 00:58:45.386
I have plans, so I need to get going.

727
00:58:46.857 --> 00:58:48.096
You do.

728
00:58:48.156 --> 00:58:49.656
Of course, you should go.

729
00:58:49.857 --> 00:58:52.297
Today won't be the last chance.

730
00:58:55.966 --> 00:58:57.107
Let's go.

731
00:58:57.707 --> 00:59:00.576
A celebrity really is different.

732
00:59:00.676 --> 00:59:01.806
Bye.

733
00:59:06.277 --> 00:59:07.777
For two hours,

734
00:59:08.417 --> 00:59:11.516
he didn't read a single line from your script.

735
00:59:37.746 --> 00:59:39.707
You have a meeting with the writers.

736
00:59:40.417 --> 00:59:43.216
I'll go by myself. You may go home.

737
00:59:43.817 --> 00:59:46.516
Sure. Good work today. See you tomorrow.

738
00:59:50.656 --> 00:59:51.826
Soo Ho.

739
00:59:57.596 --> 00:59:59.996
Did you get home safely that day?

740
01:00:01.397 --> 01:00:04.536
I was worried because you left without a word.

741
01:00:09.237 --> 01:00:12.977
I had thought we became pretty close that day.

742
01:00:14.516 --> 01:00:17.246
But the Ji Soo Ho I met today is a new person.

743
01:00:23.727 --> 01:00:25.386
I sent you...

744
01:00:25.386 --> 01:00:28.357
15 versions of the opening comment.

745
01:00:28.596 --> 01:00:29.656
Did you know that?

746
01:00:31.496 --> 01:00:32.727
You don't.

747
01:00:33.366 --> 01:00:35.196
You didn't even check my emails.

748
01:00:36.036 --> 01:00:38.437
You didn't even read my scripts.

749
01:00:41.207 --> 01:00:44.777
I know it's up to you whether or not...

750
01:00:44.777 --> 01:00:46.846
you read the script that I write,

751
01:00:47.716 --> 01:00:49.076
but shouldn't you at least...

752
01:00:49.076 --> 01:00:51.487
read it first before making that decision?

753
01:02:03.056 --> 01:02:04.127
Hey, Newbie.

754
01:02:05.286 --> 01:02:06.786
You're depressed and going...

755
01:02:06.786 --> 01:02:08.627
to drink soju by yourself, aren't you?

756
01:02:09.457 --> 01:02:10.926
You'll get drunk quickly...

757
01:02:10.926 --> 01:02:12.297
if you drink soju on a day like this.

758
01:02:12.297 --> 01:02:13.326
Come with me.

759
01:02:30.746 --> 01:02:34.087
I'll be nice and show you my hideout today.

760
01:02:34.487 --> 01:02:35.487
Get in.

761
01:02:36.257 --> 01:02:38.056
I'll just go alone today...

762
01:02:38.056 --> 01:02:39.056
Get in.

763
01:02:39.056 --> 01:02:40.156
Stop talking.

764
01:03:30.552 --> 01:03:32.152
(Radio Romance)

765
01:03:32.777 --> 01:03:34.417
I thought he had changed...

766
01:03:34.417 --> 01:03:35.977
because he kept saying, "Namaste."

767
01:03:35.977 --> 01:03:37.446
But they're empty words!

768
01:03:37.446 --> 01:03:38.917
At least you aren't saying you'll quit.

769
01:03:38.917 --> 01:03:40.757
I'm not the type of person...

770
01:03:40.757 --> 01:03:42.457
who gives up or quits.

771
01:03:42.457 --> 01:03:43.987
I've never lost to anyone either.

772
01:03:43.987 --> 01:03:45.656
Why does the writer who won over Ji Soo Ho...

773
01:03:45.656 --> 01:03:46.957
look so depressed?

774
01:03:46.957 --> 01:03:49.357
Why does life flip flop so much?

775
01:03:49.357 --> 01:03:50.527
That lunatic.

776
01:03:50.527 --> 01:03:52.926
What happened between him and Soo Ho?

777
01:03:52.926 --> 01:03:55.937
Mr. Lee. Let's stop and redo it from the top.

778
01:03:56.297 --> 01:03:57.737
What was that just now?
