00:02:55.345 --> 00:02:57.538
How can you manage to be
looking at this right now?

10
00:02:58.482 --> 00:03:00.531
This is the critical time

11
00:03:00.531 --> 00:03:03.363
in which all of the data from
the past year can be collected.

12
00:03:04.377 --> 00:03:07.181
Everyone else is packing their things.

13
00:03:09.333 --> 00:03:10.631
When do we have until?

14
00:03:10.631 --> 00:03:12.177
The end of this month, at most.

15
00:03:12.177 --> 00:03:14.163
I'm planning to wrap things up here
by the time the kids have vacation

16
00:03:14.163 --> 00:03:16.827
and move over to
the Pacific Seasonal Migration Project.

17
00:03:23.524 --> 00:03:25.010
Have you seen this?

18
00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.678
A GPS tracker?

19
00:03:27.678 --> 00:03:29.796
It sends the GPS coordinates
once every four hours

20
00:03:29.796 --> 00:03:31.220
and you can check it on an app.

21
00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.416
And it's accurate within
a 40 meter radius.

22
00:03:35.577 --> 00:03:37.159
That's crazy.

23
00:03:37.636 --> 00:03:40.312
By the way,
what are you going to do?

24
00:03:41.251 --> 00:03:44.595
I recovered 9 of the 120 rings.

25
00:03:44.595 --> 00:03:46.322
I'm planning to pack my things
when I collect 20.

26
00:03:46.322 --> 00:03:49.009
How will you manage
when we stop getting paid?

27
00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:52.058
I'll have to do anything I can
by using what I've studied.

<i>[How do birds fly?]</i>

29
00:04:15.767 --> 00:04:18.002
How do birds fly?

30
00:04:18.805 --> 00:04:21.565
I'm going to draw
the shape of a bird's wing.

31
00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.308
If you were to cut a bird's wing

32
00:04:27.308 --> 00:04:31.820
the cross-section
would look like this.

33
00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.589
Teacher!

34
00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:35.791
What's a cross-section?

35
00:04:35.791 --> 00:04:39.676
- Cross-section?
- What's a cross-section?

36
00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.545
A cross-section is...

37
00:04:57.122 --> 00:05:00.462
I thought you were going to use me
as only a science teacher.

38
00:05:00.462 --> 00:05:02.353
Yes, that was originally our plan.

39
00:05:02.353 --> 00:05:07.253
But the teacher of Class 3 said
that she's quitting immediately.

40
00:05:07.253 --> 00:05:12.450
She got pregnant with twins,
and I think her babies will be born soon.

41
00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.082
And the kids will have
their vacation soon

42
00:05:14.082 --> 00:05:16.315
so it'll be hard to hire
a new teacher.

43
00:05:16.315 --> 00:05:19.933
So please be that class's homeroom
teacher for just three weeks, Ms. Kang.

44
00:05:19.933 --> 00:05:23.134
And please help her out
a little, Ms. Song.

45
00:05:23.134 --> 00:05:25.120
Don't worry about planning lessons.

46
00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.175
I've written all of them

47
00:05:26.175 --> 00:05:29.676
so all you need to do is go to
the classroom and follow them.

48
00:05:35.421 --> 00:05:38.676
Oh Cheol died yesterday morning.

49
00:05:39.901 --> 00:05:41.498
Who died?

50
00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:45.560
Oh Cheol. It was a duck that
the kids in Class 3 were raising.

51
00:05:46.473 --> 00:05:48.944
I'm sure that the kids
will be quite sad.

52
00:05:48.944 --> 00:05:53.447
Ah, have the kids write a letter to
Oh Cheol during fifth period.

53
00:05:54.438 --> 00:05:57.555
<i>[Lesson Plan]</i>

54
00:05:57.555 --> 00:06:00.069
Write a letter to a dead duck?

55
00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:04.034
As you know,
children also feel pain from loss.

56
00:06:04.034 --> 00:06:08.466
So we have to give them
a chance to express that.

57

<i>[A Letter to Oh Cheol in Heaven]</i>

58
00:06:37.384 --> 00:06:39.170
Hye Na.

59
00:06:40.296 --> 00:06:41.767
Are you not going to write one?

60
00:06:41.767 --> 00:06:45.079
Dead things can't read letters, Teacher.

61
00:06:45.666 --> 00:06:49.462
To be honest, there's no such
thing as Heaven, either.

62
00:06:50.914 --> 00:06:54.774
I feel so sorry for Oh Cheol!

63
00:06:55.769 --> 00:06:57.272
Teacher.

64
00:06:57.272 --> 00:07:00.033
Ducks can't read, anyway.

65
00:07:00.033 --> 00:07:01.473
- Yeah, you're right!
- Yeah, you're right!

66
00:07:01.473 --> 00:07:04.986
Hi, Duck. You can't poop anymore
since you're dead, huh?

67
00:07:09.579 --> 00:07:11.971
Be quiet, kids!

68
00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:21.728
When you're dead,
you can't breathe

69
00:07:21.728 --> 00:07:24.418
and you can't eat.

70
00:07:24.418 --> 00:07:25.736
That's right.

71
00:07:26.312 --> 00:07:27.678
And you don't poop, either.

72
00:07:28.755 --> 00:07:30.767
So I'm sure he can't
read a letter, either.

73
00:07:31.329 --> 00:07:35.240
But Oh Cheol is a duck that you guys
were raising since he was young.

74
00:07:35.771 --> 00:07:38.158
So to have a duck
like that die...

75
00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.372
would probably make you all sad.

76
00:07:41.372 --> 00:07:43.553
And I'm sure you miss him, too.

77
00:07:43.553 --> 00:07:45.935
Write stuff like that in your letters.

78
00:07:46.606 --> 00:07:49.291
So if you write a letter like that

79
00:07:49.291 --> 00:07:54.240
you will feel a bit less sadness
and pain than before.

80
00:07:55.651 --> 00:07:58.199
You don't have to write
a letter if you don't want to.

81
00:07:59.115 --> 00:08:02.014
Since Oh Cheol can't
read your letter anyway.

82
00:08:06.855 --> 00:08:08.339
Goodbye!

83
00:08:11.267 --> 00:08:13.353
- Ah!
- Oh, oh!

84
00:08:13.353 --> 00:08:15.300
Goodbye, Teacher!

85
00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:18.180
You're so pretty, Teacher!

86
00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:19.561
I love you!

87
00:08:21.897 --> 00:08:24.188
- We love you!
- We love you!

88
00:08:30.193 --> 00:08:31.381
What is this?

89
00:08:40.853 --> 00:08:42.959
<i>The secret behind Oh Cheol's death.</i>

90
00:08:42.959 --> 00:08:44.704
<i>Joo Hyuk Tan and
Jang Min Sung heard that</i>

91
00:08:44.704 --> 00:08:47.026
<i>ducks die if they eat chocolate
and cooking flour</i>

92
00:08:47.026 --> 00:08:51.527
<i>so they fed the duck chocolate
and flour every day.</i>

93
00:08:55.305 --> 00:08:57.761
It's only three weeks, so do your best.

94
00:08:57.761 --> 00:09:00.978
Looks like you'll end up learning
a lot about young primates.

95
00:09:01.964 --> 00:09:04.718
I applied to programs in
China, Iceland, and Canada.

96
00:09:04.718 --> 00:09:08.516
The Skomer Center in Iceland is quite
interested in researching murres.

97
00:09:08.516 --> 00:09:09.950
How many rings did you retrieve?

98
00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:11.170
12.

99
00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:13.842
So you have eight left, then.

100
00:09:16.911 --> 00:09:20.727
Leaving quickly,
and coming back quickly.

101
00:09:20.727 --> 00:09:22.397
You're just like a migratory bird.

102
00:09:22.397 --> 00:09:24.406
I'm thinking about
not coming back this time.

103
00:09:24.406 --> 00:09:25.632
Don't you have any interest

104
00:09:25.632 --> 00:09:27.794
in participating in society,
like other people?

105
00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:32.330
Don't you want to stay in one place,
find a mate, and maybe have kids?

106
00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:35.801
10 percent of all groups of animals
are loners, you know.

107
00:09:43.651 --> 00:09:45.022
What did they say?

108
00:09:45.022 --> 00:09:47.002
Look for Soo Jin.

109
00:09:47.002 --> 00:09:49.155
Is it... cancer?

110
00:09:49.155 --> 00:09:50.677
Go find Soo Jin.

111
00:09:50.677 --> 00:09:52.722
It's been over 10 years since we
were last in touch with her

112
00:09:52.722 --> 00:09:54.642
so how could I suddenly
go and find her now?

113
00:09:54.642 --> 00:09:56.763
First, tell me what they said...

114
00:09:57.834 --> 00:10:01.877
I want my daughter, Soo Jin,
to be the first person I tell.

115
00:10:05.228 --> 00:10:09.037
"The elephant and crocodile tried to
stop them, but they wouldn't listen."

116
00:10:09.037 --> 00:10:13.584
"Then, the lion said,
'Let's all share a little.'"

117
00:10:13.584 --> 00:10:16.805
"'I think the giraffe is acting that
way because it's hungry'"

118
00:10:16.805 --> 00:10:20.795
"'and I think the monkey got mad
because it was woken up from its sleep.'"

119
00:10:20.795 --> 00:10:25.641
"The elephant saw the giraffe and monkey
make amends, and said"

120
00:10:25.641 --> 00:10:28.239
"'Wow, Lion! You really are amazing!'"

121

<i>[Normal Garbage]</i>

122
00:10:47.815 --> 00:10:49.377
Who did this?

123
00:10:50.791 --> 00:10:52.766
Teacher.

124
00:10:52.766 --> 00:10:57.915
I don't want to eat next to Hye Na.

125
00:10:58.709 --> 00:10:59.786
Why?

126
00:10:59.786 --> 00:11:04.097
Her nails are so dirty.

127
00:11:12.446 --> 00:11:14.836
<i>Do you know what my job is?</i>

128
00:11:15.655 --> 00:11:18.499
A... bird researcher?

129
00:11:18.499 --> 00:11:21.063
I know a ton about birds.

130
00:11:21.658 --> 00:11:24.603
But you know, the way that Oh Cheol
died this time was quite suspicious.

131
00:11:24.603 --> 00:11:26.626
Ducks really don't die
that easily, you see.

132
00:11:26.626 --> 00:11:29.546
But when I started observing Oh Cheol

133
00:11:29.546 --> 00:11:32.833
I noticed that he suddenly started eating
a lot less, and vomited strange things.

134
00:11:33.636 --> 00:11:35.425
Maybe...

135
00:11:36.283 --> 00:11:39.580
someone fed him something
that he shouldn't have been fed?

136
00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:44.440
For example, chocolate...
or cooking flour.

137
00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:46.729
It wasn't cooking flour.

138
00:11:46.729 --> 00:11:48.603
It was candy sugar.

139
00:11:48.603 --> 00:11:50.549
There is a way for me to check.

140
00:11:51.836 --> 00:11:54.746
I can go get
Oh Cheol's carcass

141
00:11:54.746 --> 00:11:57.478
and open up his stomach with a knife

142
00:11:57.478 --> 00:11:59.887
and check what's inside.

143
00:11:59.887 --> 00:12:01.504
And I can use the CCTV camera footage

144
00:12:01.504 --> 00:12:04.604
to find out who fed Oh Cheol
what kinds of things, too.

145
00:12:05.325 --> 00:12:06.459
Should I do it, or not?

146
00:12:06.459 --> 00:12:07.658
Don't!

147
00:12:07.658 --> 00:12:09.754
Don't, Ms. Kang.

148
00:12:10.355 --> 00:12:12.358
Can you promise me one thing?

149
00:12:13.359 --> 00:12:14.902
Don't ever...

150
00:12:15.722 --> 00:12:20.597
harass animals, girls, or anyone
weaker than you ever again.

151

- Yes, Ms. Kang.
- Yes, Ms. Kang.

152
00:12:44.055 --> 00:12:46.467

"made by..."

157
00:12:56.165 --> 00:13:02.109
"a pizza-making master from Italy."

158
00:13:07.551 --> 00:13:09.819
There are two consonants
at the end of this syllable cluster.

159
00:13:09.819 --> 00:13:11.136
It's difficult, isn't it?

160
00:13:11.161 --> 00:13:14.656
There aren't a lot of kids in my class
who know how to read all the words

161
00:13:14.656 --> 00:13:17.310
with two consonants at
the end of a syllable cluster.

162
00:13:38.256 --> 00:13:40.474
Were you surprised, Ms. Kang?

163
00:13:41.214 --> 00:13:43.458
Why are you walking around alone
at this time of night?

164
00:13:43.458 --> 00:13:46.906
I've always walked around alone,
ever since I was five years old.

165
00:13:46.906 --> 00:13:47.921
What about your mom?

166
00:13:47.921 --> 00:13:49.296
She's not home yet.

167
00:13:58.847 --> 00:14:00.932
Would you like a bite?

168
00:14:01.652 --> 00:14:03.546
I don't eat red bean buns.

169
00:14:10.079 --> 00:14:11.978
It tastes good, though.

170
00:14:17.281 --> 00:14:18.719
Want me to give you a bite?

171
00:14:31.059 --> 00:14:33.695
It really does taste like an
Italian pizza-making master made it!

172
00:14:34.248 --> 00:14:36.454
You know what I'm talking about,
right? Napoli pizza!

173
00:14:39.094 --> 00:14:40.254
You smiled.

174
00:14:40.891 --> 00:14:43.313
It's the first time I've ever
seen you smile, Ms. Kang.

175
00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:52.609
What's that?

176
00:14:52.609 --> 00:14:53.964
A notebook filled with
my favorite things.

177
00:14:53.964 --> 00:14:56.363
If I write down the things
that I like, like this

178
00:14:56.363 --> 00:15:00.055
I won't forget them, and I can take
it out to read them when I need to.

179
00:15:01.474 --> 00:15:04.542
Um... kind of like a refrigerator.

180
00:15:04.542 --> 00:15:06.228
And what do you have written in there?

181
00:15:12.705 --> 00:15:15.093
A curving, sloped road.

182
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:18.921
<i>Big bags with wheels on them.</i>

183
00:15:18.921 --> 00:15:22.030
<i>When balloons get bigger and bigger.</i>

184
00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:24.366
<i>A key, and a lock.</i>

185
00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:27.631
<i>[Cafe Latte]</i>

186
00:15:29.325 --> 00:15:31.329
Cafe lattes.

187
00:15:32.541 --> 00:15:33.642
What?

188
00:15:33.642 --> 00:15:36.321
Cafe lattes.
I really like them.

189
00:15:40.674 --> 00:15:42.973
Young children shouldn't drink coffee.

190
00:15:42.973 --> 00:15:44.141
I'm fine, though.

191
00:15:44.141 --> 00:15:46.568
If young kids drink coffee

192
00:15:46.568 --> 00:15:48.887
they won't be able to sleep well.

193
00:15:48.887 --> 00:15:50.445
And it's not good for their brains.

194
00:15:50.445 --> 00:15:51.998
You won't get taller, either.

195
00:15:51.998 --> 00:15:53.483
Really?

196
00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:58.839
What kinds of things
do you like, Ms. Kang?

197
00:16:02.862 --> 00:16:04.935
Eating a meal...

198
00:16:05.632 --> 00:16:07.910
quietly, by myself.

199
00:16:26.883 --> 00:16:28.259
Kim Hye Na.

200
00:16:28.259 --> 00:16:30.451
Listen carefully to what
I'm about to tell you.

201
00:16:31.325 --> 00:16:33.790
Cut your nails once a week.

202
00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:36.036
And wash your hair at least
once every three days.

203
00:16:36.036 --> 00:16:38.117
Be sure to wipe your mouth
after you eat anything.

204
00:16:39.603 --> 00:16:42.197
Change your socks and
underwear once a day.

205
00:16:42.765 --> 00:16:45.264
And if you don't have
a lot of clothes, alternate outfits.

206
00:16:45.264 --> 00:16:47.644
A dirty child will be attacked.

207
00:16:47.644 --> 00:16:50.221
Because it's a sign that there's
nobody taking care of them.

208
00:16:50.221 --> 00:16:53.722
So you might as well have a sign on you
that says you're easy prey.

209
00:16:54.777 --> 00:16:57.805
What do you think you need to do
if nobody is looking after you?

210
00:17:00.318 --> 00:17:02.507
You have to take care of yourself.

211
00:17:02.507 --> 00:17:04.572
Many children do this.

212
00:17:04.924 --> 00:17:07.138
So I'm sure that you will be
able to do this, too.

213
00:17:14.194 --> 00:17:19.159
Did you know how to cut your nails
when you were eight years old, too?

214
00:17:40.761 --> 00:17:42.113
You evil wench!

215
00:17:42.113 --> 00:17:43.744
You were so wicked to your mother

216
00:17:43.744 --> 00:17:45.976
so how dare you covet
someone else's child? Huh?

217
00:17:47.179 --> 00:17:52.244
You deserve to live alone forever
without ever having your own kids.

218
00:17:53.383 --> 00:17:56.411
She's my teacher, Granny.

219
00:17:56.411 --> 00:17:58.930
And I really like her.

220
00:19:07.655 --> 00:19:11.640
<i>- Hey!
- Stop it, that hurts!</i>

221
00:19:16.888 --> 00:19:18.580
Where's Hye Na?

222
00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:20.734
She's sleeping in the bathroom!

223
00:19:20.734 --> 00:19:24.410
Hey, it's not like
the bathroom is the classroom!

224
00:19:27.195 --> 00:19:29.602
<i>[Nurse's Office]</i>

225
00:19:31.267 --> 00:19:34.853
The nurse says that
she thinks she's malnourished.

226
00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:37.109
And...

227
00:19:37.109 --> 00:19:39.228
she has scars all over her body.

228
00:19:39.828 --> 00:19:43.071
I worry a lot for children who
are raised by single parents as is...

229
00:19:44.102 --> 00:19:45.726
but she's such a strange child.

230
00:19:45.726 --> 00:19:48.106
She doesn't cry
no matter what happens to her.

231
00:19:48.106 --> 00:19:51.367
Didn't you notice anything off about her?

232
00:20:06.955 --> 00:20:08.569
Hye Na.

233
00:20:11.707 --> 00:20:14.128
Did Ms. Ye Eun leave?

234
00:20:15.558 --> 00:20:16.648
Yeah.

235
00:20:22.302 --> 00:20:24.676
That teacher is weird.

236
00:20:24.676 --> 00:20:25.946
Why?

237
00:20:25.946 --> 00:20:28.507
I told her that I tripped down the stairs

238
00:20:28.507 --> 00:20:30.462
and she took a photo of me.

239
00:20:30.462 --> 00:20:32.551
Where? Which part of you
did she take a photo of...

240
00:20:33.966 --> 00:20:36.005
Do you...

241
00:20:36.005 --> 00:20:38.997
enjoy seeing other people's scars, too?

242
00:20:48.378 --> 00:20:50.826
I tripped down the stairs, too.

243
00:20:52.667 --> 00:20:54.576
Did it hurt?

244
00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:58.312
Did it hurt?

245
00:20:58.312 --> 00:21:00.292
Did you cry?

246
00:21:02.775 --> 00:21:03.965
A little.

247
00:21:06.051 --> 00:21:08.339
I didn't cry.

248
00:21:09.349 --> 00:21:13.068
At times like that, you should
think of something you like.

249
00:21:13.068 --> 00:21:16.033
Then you might stop crying
even when you're crying.

250
00:21:17.683 --> 00:21:19.679
I see.

251
00:21:19.679 --> 00:21:23.314
But you know,
Ms. Ye Eun really is weird.

252
00:21:24.283 --> 00:21:27.694
She keeps asking me if I like my mom.

253
00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:30.205
So, what did you say?

254
00:21:31.361 --> 00:21:35.759
I told her that I like her
quite a lot, of course.

255
00:21:40.482 --> 00:21:41.918
I see.

256
00:21:42.367 --> 00:21:44.178
Are you relieved?

257
00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:36.091
What did I tell you last time
about what I do to noisy kids?

258
00:22:38.907 --> 00:22:41.793
But, Uncle.

259
00:22:41.793 --> 00:22:45.842
We... live on the first floor.

260
00:22:53.629 --> 00:22:55.073
Is anyone home?

261
00:22:57.331 --> 00:22:58.968
Are you home, Hye Na?

262
00:23:04.593 --> 00:23:06.348
Oh, Hye Na!

263
00:23:07.641 --> 00:23:09.267
Hello.

264
00:23:09.267 --> 00:23:11.937
I'm Song Ye Eun, a teacher
from Hye Na's school.

265
00:23:11.937 --> 00:23:14.765
Hye Na didn't come to
school today, so...

266
00:23:14.765 --> 00:23:17.208
I called the school
and told them that she has a cold.

267
00:23:17.208 --> 00:23:19.572
Um, but...

268
00:23:20.541 --> 00:23:23.014
Hye Na, what happened to your ear?

269
00:23:23.014 --> 00:23:26.032
Oh, I'm sorry. Did it hurt?

270
00:23:26.032 --> 00:23:28.436
Um, let me see, Hye Na.

271
00:23:30.259 --> 00:23:31.866
Show her, Hye Na.

272
00:23:31.866 --> 00:23:34.032
And tell her how you got hurt.

273
00:23:35.823 --> 00:23:37.920
I got hit by a baseball.

274
00:23:38.917 --> 00:23:41.212
On the street, right here.

275
00:23:41.805 --> 00:23:43.872
Oh, you poor thing!

276
00:23:43.872 --> 00:23:45.784
They said that she almost
burst her eardrum.

277
00:23:45.784 --> 00:23:46.909
I don't know why they were

278
00:23:46.909 --> 00:23:48.678
playing baseball on the street
instead of at a field.

279
00:23:50.233 --> 00:23:51.506
Um...

280
00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:55.865
Hye Na has other injuries
all over her body, too.

281
00:23:55.865 --> 00:23:57.192
I know.

282
00:23:59.021 --> 00:24:00.683
Did you...

283
00:24:00.683 --> 00:24:03.235
come here to ask if I was the
one who did it, by any chance?

284
00:24:04.375 --> 00:24:05.755
Ms. Song.

285
00:24:05.755 --> 00:24:08.523
I just keep tripping a lot.

286
00:24:08.523 --> 00:24:13.627
The doctor said some kids trip a lot
because they have bad hearing.

287
00:24:14.726 --> 00:24:16.531
Right, Mom?

288
00:24:18.677 --> 00:24:22.619
I heard that there is a man
who is living with you two...

289
00:24:22.619 --> 00:24:23.929
Ms. Song.

290
00:24:24.653 --> 00:24:27.647
I make a living on my own,
and raise my kid alone.

291
00:24:27.647 --> 00:24:30.800
I leave for work at 10 a.m.
and come home at 8 p.m.

292
00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:32.549
so what am I supposed
to do with my child?

293
00:24:32.549 --> 00:24:34.908
Should I put a lock on the door
and lock her inside?

294
00:24:34.908 --> 00:24:41.003
Also, do I need to tell you two
if I'm seeing a man or not...

295
00:24:41.003 --> 00:24:43.119
just because you two are
my child's teachers?

296
00:24:46.968 --> 00:24:48.653
- Ow!
- Oh!

297
00:24:48.653 --> 00:24:51.140
Hye Na!
Are you all right?

298
00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:53.717
Oh no, you're bleeding!

299
00:24:53.717 --> 00:24:56.822
Oh gosh, oh no!
Are you okay?

300
00:24:57.416 --> 00:24:58.416
Huh?

301
00:25:21.535 --> 00:25:24.131
You saw that, right?
She was acting.

302
00:25:25.406 --> 00:25:27.099
They say that a child
who is being abused

303
00:25:27.099 --> 00:25:30.707
protects their parent,
no matter what.

304
00:25:48.693 --> 00:25:50.869
Goodness.

305
00:25:55.648 --> 00:25:57.372
And what did the child say?

306
00:25:57.372 --> 00:25:59.175
She said that she tripped on the stairs.

307
00:25:59.175 --> 00:26:02.446
That makes no sense. You can't get
injuries like these from tripping!

308
00:26:04.131 --> 00:26:06.619
I believe that she's lying.
100 percent.

309
00:26:06.619 --> 00:26:09.965
And her mother is saying
the same thing, as well.

310
00:26:09.965 --> 00:26:12.389
I'm sure that she told her to say that.

311
00:26:13.523 --> 00:26:16.727
First, we'll have to put in
a request for some assistance

312
00:26:16.727 --> 00:26:18.605
and pay them a visit at home.

313
00:26:18.605 --> 00:26:20.303
We'll get an idea of
the situation then, and...

314
00:26:20.303 --> 00:26:21.580
What about after that?

315
00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:24.952
To be honest, even if
a child has injuries like these

316
00:26:24.952 --> 00:26:30.148
if both the parent and child insist that
she tripped or bumped into something

317
00:26:30.148 --> 00:26:32.077
we can't do anything.

318
00:26:32.077 --> 00:26:36.795
So, our job is to visit them at home
to see if the child is safe there.

319
00:26:36.795 --> 00:26:39.108
And when necessary,
we'll work alongside the police

320
00:26:39.108 --> 00:26:40.766
and give them a stern warning.

321
00:26:40.766 --> 00:26:43.042
We'll keep an eye on them
for three to six months or so

322
00:26:43.042 --> 00:26:46.148
by paying them a visit at home
once a month, or something like that.

323
00:26:46.148 --> 00:26:49.362
Shouldn't we get that child
out of that home immediately?

324
00:26:49.362 --> 00:26:52.577
She doesn't only live with her mom!
There's a man who lives with them, too!

325
00:26:52.577 --> 00:26:55.665
Do you think her eardrum almost burst
because she was beaten by her mother?

326
00:26:55.665 --> 00:27:01.330
In Korea, parental authority is
considered to be quite important.

327
00:27:02.271 --> 00:27:04.952
According to the law, we can't
just ignore the parent's authority

328
00:27:04.952 --> 00:27:07.185
and forcibly investigate the home.

329
00:27:07.185 --> 00:27:12.248
And it's even more impossible to just
forcibly remove a child from her home.

330
00:27:23.068 --> 00:27:24.735
Hello?

331
00:27:25.962 --> 00:27:27.640
Is anyone home?

332
00:27:30.013 --> 00:27:31.487
This is the police!

333
00:27:33.399 --> 00:27:34.990
Is anyone home?

334
00:27:37.428 --> 00:27:38.701
What brings you here?

335
00:27:38.701 --> 00:27:41.311
Is this the home of
Student Kim Hye Na?

336
00:27:42.647 --> 00:27:43.740
Yes, so?

337
00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:45.254
We received a report

338
00:27:45.254 --> 00:27:47.774
so we will be confirming
if your child is faring well here.

339
00:27:47.774 --> 00:27:49.670
May we come in?

340
00:27:49.670 --> 00:27:51.295
Wait.

341
00:27:51.295 --> 00:27:52.410
Um, sure.

342
00:27:59.598 --> 00:28:01.195
Kim Hye Na!

343
00:28:24.938 --> 00:28:26.568
Are you Hye Na?

344
00:28:29.035 --> 00:28:31.521
How did you injure your ear?

345
00:28:31.521 --> 00:28:33.900
I got hit by a ball.

346
00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:35.651
A baseball.

347
00:28:36.167 --> 00:28:38.734
Why? Were you playing baseball?

348
00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:41.468
I got hit by one on the street.

349
00:28:41.468 --> 00:28:43.010
While I was walking by.

350
00:28:45.099 --> 00:28:48.134
You're a good girl, aren't you?

351
00:28:48.134 --> 00:28:50.467
You can't lie to a police officer.

352
00:28:50.467 --> 00:28:52.813
We'll check all of the CCTV cameras.

353
00:28:52.813 --> 00:28:55.157
What are you doing right now?

354
00:28:55.157 --> 00:28:57.314
Are you threatening my child?

355
00:28:57.314 --> 00:29:00.358
Well, we're here because
we received a report.

356
00:29:00.358 --> 00:29:02.920
So we need to check
everything thoroughly.

357
00:29:06.957 --> 00:29:08.794
Hey, Jjing.

358
00:29:08.794 --> 00:29:11.420
Let's eat, Jjing.

359
00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:13.190
You were hungry, weren't you?

360
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:16.147
I'll feed you, so let's eat.

361
00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:19.608
<i>I'm really sorry, Honey.</i>

362
00:29:19.608 --> 00:29:21.884
<i>I'm sorry that I'm a
woman who has a daughter.</i>

363
00:29:21.884 --> 00:29:25.103
And I'm so thankful that
you're so understanding, but...

364
00:29:26.957 --> 00:29:28.794
But please, let me ask you one favor.

365
00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:33.039
Leave her alone. Please?

366
00:29:33.637 --> 00:29:37.119
Things will be really difficult for me
if people keep showing up like this.

367
00:29:37.119 --> 00:29:39.151
If you really can't stand the kid

368
00:29:39.151 --> 00:29:41.756
should I send her off to an
orphanage or something, instead?

369
00:29:42.437 --> 00:29:44.101
<i>I'll give birth to your kid instead.</i>

370
00:29:44.101 --> 00:29:45.727
- Okay?
- Damn it!

371
00:29:53.908 --> 00:29:55.590
Don't go, Honey.

372
00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:59.987
What am I supposed to do
if you just leave like this?

373
00:30:12.011 --> 00:30:17.011
<font color="#fcc89b">[DramaFever Ver] tvN E01 Mother</font>
<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

374
00:30:27.103 --> 00:30:28.651
Mom.

375
00:30:29.281 --> 00:30:30.955
I'm sorry.

376
00:30:30.955 --> 00:30:32.484
Go away.

377
00:30:33.252 --> 00:30:35.276
I said, go away!

378
00:30:35.276 --> 00:30:37.668
Go somewhere I can't see you!

379
00:31:10.164 --> 00:31:16.452
<i>Sweet potatoes...</i>

380
00:31:17.169 --> 00:31:21.005
<i>are delicious.</i>

381
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:27.265
<i>Delicious things...</i>

382
00:31:28.015 --> 00:31:33.147
<i>are...</i>

383
00:31:37.017 --> 00:31:40.185
<i>I heard that the child is
quite obedient to her mother.</i>

384
00:31:40.185 --> 00:31:42.281
It's because her mother is
the only person she can trust

385
00:31:42.281 --> 00:31:44.313
so the child has no choice
but to cling on to her.

386
00:31:44.313 --> 00:31:46.608
I've heard back from the police

387
00:31:46.608 --> 00:31:50.137
and I've requested help from
Child Protective Services as well

388
00:31:50.137 --> 00:31:52.704
but we have to treat this matter
with the utmost seriousness.

389
00:31:53.582 --> 00:31:59.071
A child, her family, and our school's
honor are all on the line here.

390
00:31:59.071 --> 00:32:03.919
Outsiders can't really get involved
too much in other families' matters.

391
00:32:04.888 --> 00:32:08.448
At any rate, I've already
visited the principal, too.

392
00:32:12.149 --> 00:32:15.021
I don't like this school or the cops.

393
00:32:15.021 --> 00:32:19.531
If they all sit and do nothing, aren't
they all just enabling domestic violence?

394
00:32:19.531 --> 00:32:21.629
Right?

395
00:32:21.629 --> 00:32:23.332
In my opinion...

396
00:32:24.414 --> 00:32:27.296
I think we should listen a bit more
to what Hye Na has to say.

397
00:32:27.296 --> 00:32:29.911
Hye Na is being manipulated
by her mother right now!

398
00:32:29.911 --> 00:32:32.589
She said she tripped on the stairs
and got hit by a baseball!

399
00:32:32.589 --> 00:32:35.003
And you want us to keep listening
to this sort of nonsense?

400
00:32:35.821 --> 00:32:37.255
I think that Hye Na is saying that

401
00:32:37.255 --> 00:32:40.465
she's afraid to betray her mother,
who is her only blood relative.

402
00:32:41.207 --> 00:32:43.321
She's scared to say that
she got hit and was abused.

403
00:32:43.919 --> 00:32:47.572
She's embarrassed
to tell other people about it.

404
00:32:48.907 --> 00:32:54.298
And she's scared to be sent
to a facility full of strangers.

405
00:32:54.298 --> 00:32:56.865
I think those are the kinds of
things that she's saying to us.

406
00:32:56.865 --> 00:33:00.035
How long do you want us to just
sit and watch her get hit, then?

407
00:33:00.035 --> 00:33:02.093
Rather than referring to is as
"sitting and watching..."

408
00:33:02.093 --> 00:33:04.361
You're talking about this
as if it's someone else's problem.

409
00:33:04.361 --> 00:33:06.951
You don't want to become
a teacher, do you?

410
00:33:07.613 --> 00:33:09.445
Becoming a teacher means that

411
00:33:09.445 --> 00:33:13.186
you have to take on responsibilities
that may be difficult or troublesome!

412
00:33:13.186 --> 00:33:16.113
Do you honestly think that
I want to be doing this?

413
00:33:16.715 --> 00:33:18.866
My wedding is next week!

414
00:33:18.866 --> 00:33:21.628
I don't have time to be
going all over the place.

415
00:33:24.312 --> 00:33:26.271
I'll be going now.

416
00:33:46.967 --> 00:33:50.391
<i>She keeps asking me
if I like my mom.</i>

417
00:33:50.391 --> 00:33:52.518
<i>So, what did you say?</i>

418
00:33:52.518 --> 00:33:55.476
I told her that I like her a lot.

419
00:33:55.476 --> 00:33:57.543
<i>- Of course.
- Are you okay?</i>

420
00:33:57.543 --> 00:33:58.690
Huh?

421
00:33:58.690 --> 00:34:00.429
<i>Are you relieved?</i>

422
00:34:26.853 --> 00:34:30.275
<i>She finished her master's at
the University of Wisconsin in 2008.</i>

423
00:34:30.275 --> 00:34:32.447
And in 2014, she was
working on her Ph.D

424
00:34:32.447 --> 00:34:34.893
at the University of Canterbury
in New Zealand

425
00:34:34.893 --> 00:34:37.507
and moved elsewhere three years ago.

426
00:34:37.507 --> 00:34:39.755
Her advisor from the university
in New Zealand changed

427
00:34:39.755 --> 00:34:42.275
so they said that they don't know
for sure where she went.

428
00:34:42.275 --> 00:34:44.382
They did say that they'd
look into it for us, but...

429
00:34:44.382 --> 00:34:45.516
Jae Beom.

430
00:34:45.516 --> 00:34:46.697
Yes, Ma'am?

431
00:34:46.697 --> 00:34:48.360
I want you to go.

432
00:34:48.989 --> 00:34:50.040
Where?

433
00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:52.659
Do you really think they'll
try that hard for us

434
00:34:52.659 --> 00:34:55.020
when they couldn't truly know
just how much of a rush we're in?

435
00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:57.380
So, I want you to go to New Zealand.

436
00:34:57.380 --> 00:34:59.170
But, Ma'am!

437
00:34:59.170 --> 00:35:02.529
You have events on your schedule here
and you're not in the best of health.

438
00:35:02.529 --> 00:35:04.054
So how could I leave you?

439
00:35:04.054 --> 00:35:05.572
And I can't speak English, either.

440
00:35:05.572 --> 00:35:06.822
Give us a moment.

441
00:35:12.851 --> 00:35:14.322
Jae Beom.

442
00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:16.279
Yes, Ma'am?

443
00:35:17.842 --> 00:35:22.411
I'm not just asking you to
search for Soo Jin on a whim.

444
00:35:23.672 --> 00:35:25.737
For the past 10 years

445
00:35:25.737 --> 00:35:31.531
it was so hard for me to let her
roam free, doing as she wished.

446
00:35:38.585 --> 00:35:41.766
But I can't allow her to do that
anymore in my current state.

447
00:35:44.516 --> 00:35:45.889
Find her for me.

448
00:35:45.889 --> 00:35:47.400
I'm begging you.

449
00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:48.616
Mom!

450
00:35:48.616 --> 00:35:50.574
Ah, you're here, Yi Jin?

451
00:35:51.784 --> 00:35:54.415
What's going on that
you're looking for Big Sis?

452
00:35:54.415 --> 00:35:56.288
I'll tell you later.

453
00:35:56.288 --> 00:35:58.944
She hasn't contacted us once
in the past 10 years.

454
00:35:58.944 --> 00:36:01.127
And yet, there's something
you can't tell me about

455
00:36:01.127 --> 00:36:03.063
but want to talk to her about?

456
00:36:03.063 --> 00:36:06.460
She's still your big sister,
whether she kept in touch or not.

457
00:36:07.206 --> 00:36:10.261
Just wait until we find her.

458
00:37:32.886 --> 00:37:34.531
Found you.

459
00:37:45.174 --> 00:37:46.779
Eat this.

460
00:37:49.755 --> 00:37:51.248
Eat this.

461
00:38:17.603 --> 00:38:19.150
Eat it quickly.

462
00:38:23.438 --> 00:38:25.299
How disgusting.

463
00:38:32.594 --> 00:38:34.424
So, when do they want you to come?

464
00:38:34.424 --> 00:38:36.476
As soon as possible.

465
00:38:36.476 --> 00:38:37.944
Congratulations.

466
00:38:38.677 --> 00:38:39.904
Thank you.

467
00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:45.833
I used to buy you tons of food because
I thought you were from a poor family.

468
00:38:45.833 --> 00:38:47.536
I am.

469
00:38:47.536 --> 00:38:50.904
But your mom came looking for you
in your first year.

470
00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:57.043
<i>Mom!</i>

471
00:38:59.964 --> 00:39:01.779
<i>Mom!</i>

472
00:39:03.572 --> 00:39:06.063
There are a lot of cases in which the
mom is rich, but the daughter is poor.

473
00:39:06.063 --> 00:39:09.621
Feed yourself well there,
and don't be lonely.

474
00:39:10.411 --> 00:39:11.496
All right.

475
00:39:11.496 --> 00:39:12.971
I don't get lonely, though.

476
00:39:13.799 --> 00:39:16.851
Are you really not lonely at all,
even in the slightest?

477
00:39:17.482 --> 00:39:19.384
Haven't you ever liked someone
and wanted to be with them

478
00:39:19.384 --> 00:39:21.429
or gotten mad because
you cared for someone?

479
00:39:21.429 --> 00:39:22.853
You've never felt like that?

480
00:39:31.958 --> 00:39:33.875
I'm home.

481
00:39:41.610 --> 00:39:43.295
What's this?

482
00:39:58.750 --> 00:40:01.616
We were playing hide and seek.

483
00:40:01.616 --> 00:40:04.083
But I couldn't get out of here.

484
00:40:06.029 --> 00:40:07.540
Honey!

485
00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:09.976
I really find these sorts of
pranks to be quite scary!

486
00:40:10.770 --> 00:40:12.915
What if someone came here and saw this?

487
00:40:15.087 --> 00:40:17.145
Go outside and play.

Yeah, sure.

Why not?

511
00:43:03.601 --> 00:43:06.100
Because I can't read quickly.

512
00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:07.435

that your mom is good at cooking, Hye Na.

Yes! And my mom is really pretty, too!

529
00:44:19.096 --> 00:44:20.279
Really?

530
00:44:20.279 --> 00:44:22.297
She's really good at putting on makeup

531
00:44:22.297 --> 00:44:24.552
and she works at a cosmetics store.

532
00:44:24.552 --> 00:44:26.525
So she smells nice.

533
00:44:27.368 --> 00:44:28.913
But...

534
00:44:28.913 --> 00:44:31.208
why don't you ever put on
any makeup, Ms. Kang?

535
00:44:36.067 --> 00:44:39.018
My mom is really pretty, too.

536
00:44:39.627 --> 00:44:42.078
And she's really good at
putting on makeup, too.

537
00:44:42.782 --> 00:44:46.960
When I was young and watched my mom
put on makeup, I thought to myself...

538
00:44:47.634 --> 00:44:49.741
that there was no way
that I could do it.

539
00:44:50.246 --> 00:44:52.005
And that I should just
give up altogether.

540
00:44:53.119 --> 00:44:57.753
You didn't want to become
like your mom, Ms. Kang?

541
00:45:00.768 --> 00:45:01.985
Yeah.

542
00:45:02.752 --> 00:45:05.268
Did you...

543
00:45:06.469 --> 00:45:08.418
not like your mom, Ms. Kang?

544
00:45:14.183 --> 00:45:17.304
Then, who do you like, Ms. Kang?

545
00:45:21.476 --> 00:45:22.656
I like birds.

546
00:45:24.741 --> 00:45:32.185
"The birds... started..."

547
00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:37.185
"flying toward Egypt..."

548
00:45:37.210 --> 00:45:42.197
"and they are now already in Egypt."

549
00:45:44.875 --> 00:45:46.552
Migratory birds fly across oceans...

550
00:45:46.958 --> 00:45:50.076
on journeys that are sometimes
tens of thousands of kilometers long.

551
00:45:50.571 --> 00:45:52.985
And yet, they never lose their way.

552
00:45:53.596 --> 00:45:57.027
Rain or snow, day or night...

553
00:45:57.027 --> 00:45:59.020
they fly over chilly oceans...

554
00:45:59.933 --> 00:46:02.092
without any maps or landmarks
to follow as reference.

555
00:46:02.092 --> 00:46:04.355
But they always reach their
destination, no matter what.

556
00:46:04.355 --> 00:46:05.690
Wow!

557
00:46:06.114 --> 00:46:10.295
Because they have maps
and directions, all in their heads.

558
00:46:10.947 --> 00:46:15.868
What do you think it feels like
to fly such long distances?

559
00:46:17.743 --> 00:46:19.402
Want to go see them?

560
00:46:20.127 --> 00:46:21.719
The migratory birds, I mean.

561
00:46:21.719 --> 00:46:23.268
When?

562
00:46:23.755 --> 00:46:26.112
It's too cold right now.

563
00:46:26.112 --> 00:46:31.027
So if we get some sleep and
bring a blanket and some warm food...

564
00:46:34.288 --> 00:46:37.003
But then, my mom...

565
00:46:37.828 --> 00:46:40.864
My mom might worry,
don't you think?

566
00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:52.192
Yes?

567
00:46:53.371 --> 00:46:54.699
Yes.

568
00:46:55.833 --> 00:46:57.268
Yes.

569
00:46:59.485 --> 00:47:01.446

I've never asked you for
a favor before, right, Senior?

581
00:48:36.542 --> 00:48:37.960

check to see if she's safe for me?

584
00:48:56.045 --> 00:48:58.034
What do I need to check on, exactly?

If she's attending school
and is getting home safely.

586

I don't know. I feel like
something will happen.

587
00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:07.987
Is she a student in your class?

588
00:49:07.987 --> 00:49:09.603
- Yes.
- So, why?

589
00:49:09.603 --> 00:49:11.013
I'm worried.

590
00:49:11.013 --> 00:49:13.837
I'm so worried that
I feel like I'll get angry!

591
00:49:20.746 --> 00:49:23.081
I saw the man who lives
with her and her mother.

592
00:49:24.543 --> 00:49:26.813
It was the first time
that I'd ever seen him, but...

593
00:49:28.214 --> 00:49:30.507
he had a look in his eyes
that I am familiar with.

594
00:49:31.688 --> 00:49:34.891
The look of a beast who
breaks women and children.

Well, at any rate,
congratulations.

A person needs to chase her dreams.

I'm sure I'll find
another teacher somehow.

598

Don't worry too much.

I'm sure things were quite tough on you

You didn't cry, right?

625

If you cry, you die.

638
00:54:37.213 --> 00:54:40.215
<i>When balloons get bigger and bigger.</i>

639
00:54:40.215 --> 00:54:42.626
Want me to tell you
what I did to Jjing?

640
00:54:44.947 --> 00:54:47.738
I pressed down on her
really hard, like this.

641
00:54:47.738 --> 00:54:49.354
Really, really hard.

642
00:54:50.188 --> 00:54:52.519
<i>The road that leads to the ocean.</i>

643
00:54:52.519 --> 00:54:54.421
And then, do you know
what happened to her?

644
00:54:55.785 --> 00:54:59.874
Her eyes swelled up
like a shrimp's eyes...

645
00:55:00.923 --> 00:55:03.796
and they popped right out of her head.

646
00:55:03.796 --> 00:55:05.807
There was this liquid,
the color of blood.

647
00:55:06.746 --> 00:55:09.919
And there was also this sticky thing
mixed in there, like saliva.

648
00:55:09.919 --> 00:55:11.459
All right?

649
00:55:12.073 --> 00:55:13.610
<i>The sun reflecting on the ocean.</i>

650
00:55:13.610 --> 00:55:14.713
All right?

651
00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:27.410
You're disgusting, all right?

652
00:55:29.369 --> 00:55:31.555
You're disgusting.

653
00:55:59.657 --> 00:56:01.302
Mom!

654
00:56:04.242 --> 00:56:05.568
<i>Mom.</i>

655
00:56:05.568 --> 00:56:08.164
<i>When my mom hugs me tight.</i>

656
00:56:08.164 --> 00:56:09.813
How disgusting!

657
00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:18.117
How disgusting!

<i>[Cafe Latte]</i>

00:56:24.586 --> 00:56:26.336
<i>Cafe Latte.</i>

660
00:56:28.039 --> 00:56:30.226
What time is the movie?

661
00:56:30.226 --> 00:56:32.611
I want to have a nice,
sweet cup of coffee.

662
00:56:32.611 --> 00:56:34.988
I need to get myself together, too.

663
00:56:43.528 --> 00:56:45.457
<i>Cafe latte.</i>

664
00:56:54.124 --> 00:56:58.168
<i>The first day that
Ms. Kang Soo Jin smiled.</i>

665
00:58:21.150 --> 00:58:23.247
I'm sorry.

666
00:58:39.802 --> 00:58:41.650
I'm sorry.

667
00:58:58.588 --> 00:59:01.601
Would you like some water, Hye Na?

668
00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:10.561
Is there anything you want to eat?

669
00:59:14.787 --> 00:59:16.499
Would you like...

670
00:59:17.081 --> 00:59:18.467
a cafe latte?

671
00:59:27.180 --> 00:59:29.342
I want to go see...

672
00:59:31.622 --> 00:59:35.003
the migratory birds, Ms. Kang.

673
00:59:57.472 --> 01:00:00.711
I'll tell you a secret.

674
01:00:06.403 --> 01:00:08.789
His name was...

675
01:00:09.428 --> 01:00:11.581
Lee Hwan.

676
01:00:13.271 --> 01:00:17.168
When Uncle was living with him and Mom...

677
01:00:18.448 --> 01:00:21.927
he was being too noisy...

678
01:00:22.412 --> 01:00:25.356
so Uncle threw him off the balcony.

679
01:00:27.314 --> 01:00:30.479
But that apartment
was on the fourth floor.

680
01:00:35.731 --> 01:00:37.731
You don't have to tell me.

681
01:00:38.434 --> 01:00:40.499
Don't tell me if it's scary
for you to remember.

682
01:00:44.197 --> 01:00:48.108
At the time, he was five years old...

683
01:00:49.336 --> 01:00:53.425
and died, so he can't become
an elementary schooler anymore.

684
01:00:54.246 --> 01:00:58.327
He attended Long Legs Kindergarten,
and was in the Ongdalsaem Class...

685
01:00:59.197 --> 01:01:01.825
so I wrote his name
in my notebook.

686
01:01:03.265 --> 01:01:09.769
Even if all of his classmates
and teachers forget his name...

687
01:01:10.213 --> 01:01:12.729
I will never forget it.

688
01:01:13.778 --> 01:01:18.470
Because the only person
who knows how he really died...

689
01:01:19.798 --> 01:01:22.331
is me.

690
01:01:23.952 --> 01:01:27.151
Uncle told me that he'd kill me...

691
01:01:27.831 --> 01:01:30.613
if I told someone else.

692
01:02:24.653 --> 01:02:27.923
<i>Hey, you guys!
Where are you all going?</i>

693
01:02:27.923 --> 01:02:30.798
<i>Can't you take me with you?</i>

694
01:02:30.798 --> 01:02:33.463
<i>Take me away with you!</i>

695
01:02:34.389 --> 01:02:36.075
<i>Far away!</i>

696
01:02:36.075 --> 01:02:38.383
<i>Far, far away!</i>

697
01:02:40.146 --> 01:02:42.146
<i>To Heaven!</i>

698
01:03:15.771 --> 01:03:17.140
Hye Na.

699
01:03:17.704 --> 01:03:19.206
Listen to me carefully.

700
01:03:20.655 --> 01:03:22.816
I will take you away.

701
01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:24.977
To a place several
thousand kilometers away

702
01:03:24.977 --> 01:03:26.233
where nobody will find you.

703
01:03:26.921 --> 01:03:31.572
Won't you go to jail
if you do that, Ms. Kang?

704
01:03:33.755 --> 01:03:35.356
I could.

705
01:03:35.356 --> 01:03:37.543
No, Ms. Kang!

706
01:03:39.778 --> 01:03:41.553
You don't have to leave with me.

707
01:03:42.081 --> 01:03:44.438
If you leave, you'll never
be able to come back.

708
01:03:45.026 --> 01:03:47.227
And you'll never be able
to see your mom again, either.

709
01:03:48.803 --> 01:03:51.258
But if you go back home...

710
01:03:51.918 --> 01:03:55.816
you may end up like Lee Hwan
from Ongdalsaem Class one day, too.

711
01:03:57.032 --> 01:04:02.057
Why is it that a child
can't survive without a mother?

712
01:04:02.057 --> 01:04:03.327
They can.

713
01:04:04.342 --> 01:04:06.403
And I'll help you so that you can.

714
01:04:06.403 --> 01:04:09.845
My mom threw me away
in the trash bin!

715
01:04:18.861 --> 01:04:20.650
And now...

716
01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:23.577
you will be the one
throwing your mom away.

717
01:04:29.374 --> 01:04:30.805
Will you be able to do it?
