2
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:09.750

as well as men's hearts.

4
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.220
The masked singers captured everyone's heart with their talents.

5
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.290
It's Shownu.

6
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:17.660
And we were happy to see some familiar faces.

7
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.190
It's Kyul Kyung. It's Kim Jae Woo.

8
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.030
And four talented masked singers...

9
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:24.860

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.680
The intense battle resumes.

15
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.690
Will Red Mouth be able to win for the fifth time?

16
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.090
It starts right now.

17
00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.860
(King of Mask Singer)

This is the first match of Round Two, Semi-finals.

19
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.800
This masked singer beat the singer Shownu.

20
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.740
She heals us with her music.

21

It's Sleeping Bear.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.290
I'm really looking forward to her performance.

I have a feeling that it'll be a great performance.

27
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.660

(People have high expectations for Sleeping Bear.)

36
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.460
(All eyes are on the first match of Round Two.)

37
00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.690
(To go one step further to the throne,)

38
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.030
(what has Sleeping Bear prepared?)

39
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.270
("Barbie Doll" by Jaurim)

40
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.900
My gosh, I know this song. What do I do?

41
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.640
It sounds like a song the current queen would sing.

42
00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.670
Exactly.

43
00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.440
(What?)

44
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.120

(Sleeping Bear has changed into a seductive performer.)

50
00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.420
(Surprised)

51
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.860
(Goodness. Who could this be?)

52
00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.710

53
00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.730

(Dancing)

56
00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.410
(With the faster beat,)

57
00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.780
(watch out not to be too immersed in her performance.)

58

61
00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:31.330
(Sleeping Bear gave an amazing performance, singing "Barbie Doll".)

62
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.030
(That was insane!)

63
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.770
(They're awestruck by her performance.)

64
00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:40.340

65
00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:43.940
- We might have a new queen today. - She's great.

66
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:46.310
Here comes her opponent.

67
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.080
He beat Actor Kang Sung Jin.

68
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:52.680
His hot and posh voice heats up our heart.

69
00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.490
Thank You for Your Support, Torch Man.

70
00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:59.020
(Thank You for Your Support, Torch Man)

71
00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.590
(It's a torch relay heading towards the throne.)

72
00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.260
(I'm going to heat up your heart.)

73
00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:07.870
(He set fire to their hearts.)

74
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.740
Torch Man is the hot guy of Korea.

75
00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.140
Who is he?

76
00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:13.970
I'm so curious.

77
00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:16.410
I think I know him, but I'm not sure.

78
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:19.340
(His powerful voice proves that he's skillful.)

79
00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.150
(He hits high notes with his resonant voice.)

80
00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:25.850
(He used to be a rocker, and now he's a trot musician?)

81
00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:31.720
(Including the experts, everyone is confused.)

82
00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.690
(His specialty embarrassed himself.)

83
00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.600
(Who is this whimsical man?)

84
00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:40.300
(It's time to heat up again.)

85
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.800
(Will he get to win the panelists' hearts...)

86
00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:46.600
(and beat his rival, Sleeping Bear?)

87
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:49.370
(Will he be able to take a step closer to the queen?)

88
00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.880
(Torch Man is ready.)

89
00:07:55.410 --> 00:08:00.990
("I'll Move" by Brown Eyed Soul)

90
00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.420
(Humming)

91
00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:06.860
(His humming blows the audience's mind.)

92
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.540
His voice is different from before.

93
00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.770
(His voice has become sweeter than in Round One.)

94
00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:28.980
(How nice.)

95
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:15.630
(He hits high notes with the sweet voice.)

96
00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:17.100
(This is mind-blowing.)

97
00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:40.050
(I love it.)

98
00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:01.470
(I can't watch this.)

99
00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:37.310
(His voice is so attractive.)

100
00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:53.520
(Breaking up is so incredibly sad that your whole body aches.)

101
00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:10.210
(He hits the high notes, deepening the sadness.)

102
00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:39.140
(A black hole-like ad lib that draws everyone's attention)

103
00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.200
(He's amazing.)

104
00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:15.370
(I'll move)

105
00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:20.110
(His sweet voice expressed extreme sadness through the song.)

106
00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:22.780
(His voice is my favorite from now on.)

107
00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:24.720
(I love him so much.)

108
00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:26.980
- It's a big match. - It was amazing.

109
00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.090
What is this? What just happened?

110
00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:31.160
His singing skill is like a pro's. How can we not know who he is?

111
00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:32.660
How can we not know?

112
00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:37.300
The first match of Round Two is over.

113
00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:41.600
The celebrity panelists are in deep thoughts.

114
00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:42.800
- Yu Yeong Seok. - Yes.

115
00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.040
Was it tough?

116
00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:48.870
I want to show respect to those who have pressed the buttons before me.

117
00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:52.980
In my opinion, this show was like one of the best top 10.

118
00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:55.350
You're saying it's one of the best among Round Two.

119
00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:57.580
He came to sudden prominence in the show like a comet.

120
00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:01.850
These two are working their ways to be the King of Mask Singer.

121
00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:03.350
Two of them did really well.

122
00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:08.060
Sleeping Bear's performance reminded me of Catgirl, Cha Ji Yeon.

123
00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:09.290
- Did it? - Yes.

124
00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:12.100
(Charismatic show that reminded people of Cha Ji Yeon)

125
00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.100
And the thing about her that surprised me was...

126
00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:18.240
when she was singing the part "I'm not a Barbie doll",

127
00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:22.210
she was spinning her head, and yet she was singing stably.

128
00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:24.640
Her vibrations sounded like they were recorded.

129
00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:28.310
(Her special skill of singing as she spins her head)

130
00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:31.280
(Her voice was so stable as if it was recorded.)

131
00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:34.520
At that moment, I thought it was over.

132
00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:38.220
I thought she'd be the next queen since Round One.

133
00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:41.430
I was so sure that she'd be the next queen.

134
00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:43.960
But I didn't know Torch Man could sing so well too.

135
00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:47.060
She sang her songs in a jazzy way like some musicals.

136
00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:49.300
His song was based on rhythm and blues.

137
00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:51.970
He got softness like Shin Yong Jae's.

138
00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:54.670
He also has sharpness like Kim Jo Han's.

139
00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:56.310
Shin Yong Jae and Kim Jo Han.

140
00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:59.440
He also has the original rhythm and blues technique.

141
00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.410
Your comment on him was extraordinary.

142
00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:02.950
You two did such a great job.

143
00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:05.150
That's why it was tough for you to press the button.

144
00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:07.650
That Korean flag on his chest...

145
00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:09.750
was not a simple ornament.

146
00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:10.760
He's like the national champion.

147
00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:12.920
- His voice is representing Korea? - Yes.

148
00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:14.860
- Gosh. - I was really surprised.

149
00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:18.300
I kept being reminded of the phrase, "The deep rooted tree".

150
00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:21.570
His roots are so deep that his voice is so stable.

151
00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:25.000
His voice can overcome all storms.

152
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.870
- Yes, yes. - His voice was so deep.

153
00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:30.240
His voice is absolutely stable.

154
00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.480
I was really touched by his performance.

155
00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:34.550
- He's like an old pine tree. - You're right.

156
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:37.480
Whereas for Sleeping Bear, she sang a song of Jaurim.

157
00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:40.450
It's hard to not be reminded of the original singer.

158
00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:45.460
However, I clearly heard the voice of Sleeping Bear only.

159
00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:47.790
She has her own style.

160
00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:50.630
She sang it with her own soul.

161
00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:52.500
Her voice was heard so clearly.

162
00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:54.870
One of them will go home today.

163
00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:57.500
But both of them will be greatly missed.

164
00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.670
I'll keep wondering where I can hear their voices.

165
00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:03.010
I was thinking this the whole time while watching their performances.

166
00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:06.410
I think this moment of Round Two is definitely a historical scene.

167
00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:07.410
Thank you so much.

168
00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:12.320
There are too many good singers in the Korean music industry.

169
00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:16.220
The celebrity panelist's reasoning skill...

170
00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:18.090
is absolutely horrible.

171
00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:20.390
- They sound related. - Yes.

172
00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:21.730
There are 11 to 12 of us.

173
00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:23.560
I think we have to increase the number of panelists.

174
00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:27.230
- Really? Isn't 12 enough? - I think it should be 50.

175
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:29.900
We have to guess and ask. And it's so unlikely that we get it.

176
00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:31.900
(Human wave strategy of collective intelligence?)

177
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.170
We have to know singers who are as good as them.

178
00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:38.280
It's surprising how there are new good singers every week.

179
00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:39.480
It's truly amazing.

180
00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:42.050
I'm wondering who will be the good match for the queen.

181
00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:44.480
It has to be someone who makes the Final Round tenser.

182
00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:47.150
- You're even foreseeing that. - Yes. Actually,

183
00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:50.250
Sleeping Beauty's voice is more similar to the current queen's.

184
00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:54.390
- Sleeping Beauty? - Yes, even her shows are similar.

185
00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:57.830
This means there are more chances for Sleeping Beauty to win.

186
00:15:57.830 --> 00:15:59.360
- Oh, really? - But, in fact,

187
00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:02.870
it's really hard for Sleeping Beauty to win against Torch Man.

188
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:05.500
It's because this man sang...

189
00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:08.110
the popular pop song extremely well.

190
00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:11.180
We can't just ignore that fact.

191
00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:14.210
On the other hand,

192
00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:16.410
I'm just worried if he can...

193
00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:19.020
win over the current queen's superb performance skills.

194
00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:21.320
- I'm just slightly worried. - It's ironic.

195
00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:23.220
Whoever goes to Final Round,

196
00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:26.190
the match will be fun for sure.

197
00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:27.760
I'm done for.

198
00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:31.260
I heard that while listening to Torch Man's song,

199
00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.600
one of the celebrity panelists...

200
00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:35.800
shed tears.

201
00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:38.140
It's Yoo Jung from Weki Meki.

202
00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.510
She cried so much.

203
00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:42.340
I mean...

204
00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:44.010
- Why did you cry? - I've never seen her crying.

205
00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:46.210
When he sang the song,

206
00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:49.680
I had goosebumps all over my body.

207
00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:51.050
I thought...

208
00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:55.520
my ex-boyfriend must sang like he did when we broke up.

209
00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:58.520
You were reminded of someone?

210
00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:02.090
- Sorry? - You know someone who stood aside?

211
00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.300
(No, it's not like that.)

212
00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:05.660
- It's not that? - No, it was hypothetical.

213
00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:08.200
He delivered the message within the song so well.

214
00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.970
That's why I cried.

215
00:17:11.570 --> 00:17:12.600
Sleeping Bear's performance...

216
00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:15.510
was amazing that I lost my senses.

217
00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:18.640
Her mask looked cute in the beginning.

218
00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.380
When she began her performance,

219
00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:22.780
her eyebrows suddenly became droopy.

220
00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:24.920
And it was quite scary.

221
00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:26.920
You're right. There are times like that.

222
00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:29.320
Her mask suddenly looked scary.

223
00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:31.520
It's like a doll that usually looks cute...

224
00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:34.390
- That's right. - suddenly looking scary at night.

225
00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:37.500
- It was so scary. - Do I look like a bear?

226
00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:38.800
Yes. Yes.

227
00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:41.700
You loved both performances, but there were some differences.

228
00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:45.700
Great. Now it's the time for us to see their specialty.

229
00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:49.170
First, it's Torch Man. He's going to dance.

230
00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:50.880
He's wearing a suit that suits the Winter Olympics.

231
00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:54.410
He said he prepared dances...

232
00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:56.810
after pulling out DNAs of the athletes.

233
00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:58.520
Music, please.

234
00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:02.190
He's warming up. Which sport is it going to be?

235
00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:03.350
(The first game is speed skating.)

236
00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:05.360
It's skating.

237
00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:08.260
It must be speed skating.

238
00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:09.260
(But it looks weird.)

239
00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:10.360
That's right.

240
00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.600
It must be speed skating.

241
00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:13.660
(I'm ruined. You should go first.)

242
00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:15.030
That's right.

243
00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:16.230
(Goodness.)

244
00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:19.340
It's skiing now.

245
00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:22.940
It's a ski jump.

246
00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:25.140
(Jumping across the cool air)

247
00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:26.980
(The point is to jump as far as he can.)

248
00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:30.210
- It's a ski jump! - Ski jump!

249
00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.990
(Skiing to the nearby neighborhood)

250
00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:36.890
(What is this?)

251
00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:41.390
It's figure skating this time.

252
00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:42.930
It's a turn!

253
00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:44.130
(Jumping softly)

254
00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:45.500
(It's funny.)

255
00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:49.730
The last dance imitates Yuna Kim.

256
00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:52.540
The last move was Yuna Kim's.

257
00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:56.740
I don't think he is an amazing dancer.

258
00:18:56.740 --> 00:19:01.510
I think he just danced because our staff asked him to do something.

259
00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:03.680
He's done it against his will.

260
00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:05.320
He must have hated to do this.

261
00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:07.390
I think he has just done it without his passion.

262
00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:09.220
- Oh, really? - And I don't think he's the type...

263
00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:11.090
who plays like that too.

264
00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:14.190
He doesn't have any frivolous side in him.

265
00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:15.590
I don't agree to that.

266
00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:16.930
- Right? - From last week,

267
00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:19.800
I've spotted that his moves were very playful.

268
00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.100
- Were they? - Yes, he was moving all the time.

269
00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:24.570
He immediately reacted to everything we said.

270
00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:27.000
So it's amazing how he doesn't dance well.

271
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.070
- Really? - I thought he'd dance well.

272
00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:30.480
- You thought he'd dance well. - Yes.

273
00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:33.040
Okay. It's Sleeping Bear's turn.

274
00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:37.010
She's going to imitate a lot of people.

275
00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:38.020
Let's hear them.

276
00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.150
Martha, please turn to MBC.

277
00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:43.720
I have to see if King of Mask Singer is on now.

278
00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:45.660
I love her voice.

279
00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:48.190
We're here at Traffic Center.

280
00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:50.390
There are many roads with high volume of traffic.

281
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:53.430
The specialty road has lost its usual speed.

282
00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:55.400
The traffic cast is done for today.

283
00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.100
I'll connect you to the theme park.

284
00:19:57.770 --> 00:20:01.210
Hello, this is the Mask Theme Park that's full of dreams and fantasy.

285
00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:03.040
Before the roller coaster starts,

286
00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:04.740
please keep your glasses...

287
00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:09.050
in the lockers. Please keep your glasses.

288
00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:11.620
The moment you think the glasses might fall off,

289
00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:13.790
the glasses won't be there.

290
00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:15.820
(Hold on tight. Glasses will fly away.)

291
00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:18.720
- Oh, my goodness. - She's good.

292
00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:22.530
She showed three different voices at once.

293
00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:24.860
Now, we're back to Torch Man.

294
00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:29.670
The panelist has praised him on his high pitched voice.

295
00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:32.040
It's a high pitch battle.

296
00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:34.040
He wants to have a battle with Kwon Hyeok Soo.

297
00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:37.340
Hyeok Soo's excellent in high pitches.

298
00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:40.310
Shall we start with Kim Kyung Ho imitation?

299
00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:41.910
Please start with Kim Kyung Ho's.

300
00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:46.350
I loved you, but

301
00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:48.350
But

302
00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:49.490
(Thanks Kim Kyeong Ho for joining with us today again.)

303
00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:50.760
- He's ready. - I'm ready.

304
00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:53.690
Let's get it started with Hyeok Soo first.

305
00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:55.790
- Masked king - Masked king

306
00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:58.060
- Masked king - Goodness.

307
00:20:58.060 --> 00:20:59.400
He suddenly went up too high.

308
00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.370
- He raised about three keys up. - It's really high.

309
00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:02.800
He wants to finish it quickly.

310
00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:04.300
Hold on, Hyeok Soo.

311
00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:05.970
I also have to appear on TV too.

312
00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:08.310
Yes, could you repeat it?

313
00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:12.640
- Masked king - Masked king

314
00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:14.910
- Good. - Masked king

315
00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:16.780
Higher.

316
00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:17.780
Hyeok Soo.

317
00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:19.320
Masked king

318
00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:20.520
I can't go higher.

319
00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:22.720
- Torch Man wins. - This is my limit.

320
00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:23.760
(Torch Man wins without much difficulty.)

321
00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:25.890
(Well...)

322
00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:28.030
Hyeok Soo isn't an easy match either.

323
00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:30.060
He broke the existing standard...

324
00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:32.300
of variety shows. I mean, people usually go back and forth,

325
00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:34.000
- but he broke it right away. - I know.

326
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.730
People usually go up step by step.

327
00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:38.200
- He sang the highest right away. - Right.

328
00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:40.840
- Ho Young, can you do it? - Me?

329
00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.340
Ho Young?

330
00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:45.010
Ho Young is up next.

331
00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:47.280
- Masked king - Masked king

332
00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:49.610
Masked king

333
00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:54.250
- Masked king - Masked king

334
00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:56.890
Masked king

335
00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:01.330
- Masked king - You failed.

336
00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:04.130
Be a masked king.

337
00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:06.030
(Take this, and be a masked king.)

338
00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:08.030
Ho Young loses.

339
00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:09.600
- Torch Man wins. - Gosh, Ho Young.

340
00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:10.670
(The studio is warmer than anywhere else.)

341
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.570
Ho Young made this funny.

342
00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:15.810
He was like Lee Jung Sub just now.

343
00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.240
(Thank you for your special appearance.)

344
00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:20.580
Good. Now, it's time to see the result.

345
00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:23.310
Whom does the audience want to see in the next round?

346
00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:25.280
I'll now reveal...

347
00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:27.550
the winner of this match.

348
00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:30.460
Who will advance to Round Three?

349
00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:32.860
(She chose to sing an unpredictable song.)

350
00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:35.460
(But her performance was even more unpredictable.)

351
00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:39.830
(Sleeping Bear's beautiful madness gave the audience goosebumps.)

352
00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:46.140
(His sentimental voice set the audience's hearts on fire.)

353
00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:49.670
(With the honey-like voice,)

354
00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:52.640
(Torch Man showed his unbelievable singing ability.)

355
00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:55.610
Between Sleeping Bear and Torch Man,

356
00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:58.720
who will win this match...

357
00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:02.850
and advance to the next round?

358
00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:06.520
- Gosh. - I can't predict the result.

359
00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.030
I can't see the result.

360
00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:13.870
Who's the first winner who will advance to Round Three?

361
00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:15.070
The winner is...

362
00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:19.000
(Torch Man wins.)

363
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.400
Torch Man wins.

364
00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:22.310
(The torch is still burning.)

365
00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:24.440
(Torch Man will ignite again in Round Three.)

366
00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:26.680
(Some of the audience feel bad too.)

367
00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:28.950
Sleeping Bear did such a good job too.

368
00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:32.380
The voting difference is 59 to 40.

369
00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:34.790
He advances to Round Three dramatically.

370
00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:37.890
Please return to your waiting room. Give him a round of applause.

371
00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:40.860
(The identity of Sleeping Bear will be revealed soon.)

372
00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:43.330
Brace yourself, masked queen.

373
00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:45.300
Bye.

374
00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:48.100
Who could she be?

375
00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:50.540
It's time to reveal her identity now.

376
00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:54.140
Now, Sleeping Bear, please take off your mask...

377
00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:56.110
and reveal your identity.

378
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:59.110
(Her performance reminded them of Catgirl.)

379
00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:02.310
(Her Round Two stage would be remembered for a long time.)

380
00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:05.080
(Is she the singer in Mi Youn's generation?)

381
00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:07.820
(Sleeping Bear is Mi Youn's favorite singer.)

382
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:13.060
(She made full use of her voice to show off her specialty.)

383
00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:16.430
Please take off your mask, and reveal your face.

384
00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:17.900
(Surprised)

385
00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:20.060
(Oh, my goodness. Who is this?)

386
00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:22.800
Who is she?

387
00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:24.140
I guess a lot of them know her.

388
00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:26.640
She's...

389
00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:29.710
She is...

390
00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:33.310
the fairy of the indie music field.

391
00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:35.810
She's the singer, Sim Gyu Seon.

392
00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:37.380
She's Sim Gyu Seon.

393
00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:38.580
(Sleeping Bear is Sim Gyu Seon.)

394
00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:40.020
Sim Gyu Seon.

395
00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:41.020
(I know her.)

396
00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:42.090
Sim Gyu Seon.

397
00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:43.290
Right?

398
00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:45.520
(Her long-time fan welcomes her.)

399
00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:48.960
Please say hello to the viewers.

400
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:50.930
Hello.

401
00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:54.830
I performed here as Sleeping Bear today.

402
00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:56.930
I'm Sim Gyu Seon. It's nice to meet you.

403
00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:02.310
(She drew attention as a guest vocal of Epitone Project in 2010.)

404
00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:05.280
(Later, she pursued her own music with deeper sentiments.)

405
00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:08.280
(She earned her position as a singer songwriter, Sim Gyu Seon.)

406
00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:10.680
(With her desperate emotions and persuasive voice,)

407
00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:13.920
(she has sung a lot of soundtracks too.)

408
00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:16.190
(She expresses music with all her body.)

409
00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:18.620
(She has a soul full of freedom.)

410
00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:21.090
(Her beautiful lyrics and sorrowful emotion...)

411
00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:25.800
(deliver sincerity to listeners and comfort them.)

412
00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:28.970
A lot of people wonder why she's unknown...

413
00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:30.840
when she's such a great singer.

414
00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:33.640
- Mi Youn said she knew her. - She knew.

415
00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:34.710
- Did you guess her right? - I...

416
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:36.770
recognized her the moment I heard her...

417
00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:39.740
because her voice color is unique.

418
00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:41.410
And I love it.

419
00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:45.520
She recognized me since the duet song.

420
00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:47.550
I'm so grateful and happy.

421
00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:48.920
She's good at keeping secrets.

422
00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:49.990
I know.

423
00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:51.290
She kept her identity a secret.

424
00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:53.160
Her mouth is like a lock.

425
00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:54.790
- What did you say? - A lock.

426
00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:57.330
- A lock. - Are you bad at hearing things?

427
00:25:57.330 --> 00:25:58.400
(Frustrated)

428
00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.200
- I don't understand. - Maybe I've gone deaf.

429
00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:02.230
Why did I hear it wrong?

430
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:04.040
Yoo Jung, did you know who she was too?

431
00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:06.240
Yes, I'm her huge fan too.

432
00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.970
I like so many of her songs...

433
00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:09.940
like "Ophelia"...

434
00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:12.910
and "The Moon and Sixpence". I wanted to see her in person.

435
00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:14.910
I'm so honored and grateful.

436
00:26:14.910 --> 00:26:16.380
It's an honor for me.

437
00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:18.550
You knew who she was, but you didn't say it.

438
00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:20.690
You're a lock yourself too.

439
00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:22.050
(Smiling)

440
00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:23.820
And you heard it wrong, didn't you?

441
00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:26.090
(He's getting dizzy.)

442
00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:27.990
A lock! Have you gone deaf?

443
00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:31.930
We asked her to write any misunderstanding or prejudice...

444
00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:33.500
which she wanted to explain in the show.

445
00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:35.530
"I'm not the fairy of Hongdae."

446
00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:38.140
No, when I debuted, coincidentally,

447
00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:41.510
there were some female singers who performed in Hongdae.

448
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:44.780
I was mentioned along with them,

449
00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:47.650
so I came to have this nickname.

450
00:26:47.650 --> 00:26:51.120
But my fans don't think I'm the fairy of Hongdae.

451
00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:53.350
They rather think I'm the daughter of Hongdae.

452
00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:57.050
I'm actually very bright and active.

453
00:26:57.050 --> 00:26:59.820
Because I sing in a feminine style,

454
00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:03.090
people think I'm feminine too. I feel a bit bad about it.

455
00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:05.360
You had a story behind it.

456
00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:09.370
She showed us another charm with a new type of voice.

457
00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:13.000
Please give her a round of applause to Gyu Seon.

458
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.070
(We're rooting for her future career.)

459
00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:19.280
When I first debuted,

460
00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:21.950
I wanted to have a lot of people...

461
00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:25.620
recognize me just by hearing my voice.

462
00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:27.250
It was my small goal.

463
00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:30.520
I think I achieved that goal in a sense.

464
00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:32.960
I'm so glad and happy.

465
00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:36.360
I, Sim Gyu Seon, performed today...

466
00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:37.930
as Sleeping Bear.

467
00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:40.300
I'll try hard to sing...

468
00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:42.730
warm and comforting songs...

469
00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:45.300
in the future as well. Please support me.

470
00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:47.640
Please give me a lot of love and support. Thank you.

471
00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:49.410
As a result of Round Two,

472
00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:52.640
Thank You for Your Support, Torch Man, won against Sim Gyu Seon...

473
00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:54.280
and advanced to Round Three.

474
00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:57.450
It's the second match of Round Two.

475
00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:00.150
She has a cute, fresh,

476
00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:01.550
and juicy voice.

477
00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:05.160
Red Head Adolescent, Strawberry Girl.

478
00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:09.930
(She takes refreshing steps to the throne.)

479
00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:12.430
(She's in a perfect condition.)

480
00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:15.270
(She's cute.)

481
00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:18.840
I love strawberries

482
00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:20.670
She might sing a powerful song.

483
00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:22.840
Something powerful.

484
00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:25.610
She has a nice voice, right?

485
00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:27.040
- It was fresh. - Right.

486
00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:31.520
(She has a juicy and sweet voice.)

487
00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:35.290
(She also rapped, playing with the rhythm.)

488
00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:38.590
(Is she a rapper?)

489
00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:40.460
(She's definitely a singer.)

490
00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:42.430
(She couldn't hide...)

491
00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:43.960
(her dance skills as a girl group member.)

492
00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:46.660
(She's cute like crazy.)

493
00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:50.030
(Strawberry Girl has fatal charms.)

494
00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:52.770
(Now, it's time to hear her voice alone.)

495
00:28:54.010 --> 00:28:55.270
(With her own sweetness,)

496
00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:57.640
(will she be able to defeat her opponent?)

497
00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:01.910
(How will her performance be?)

498
00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:13.020
("Rocket Punch Generation" by W and Whale)

499
00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:14.690
- It's "RPG". - It's by W and Whale.

500
00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:24.540
(The rhythm catches the audience's ears from the start.)

501
00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:25.940
(She's a rapper, right?)

502
00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:26.940
(Is she?)

503
00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:33.910
(Amazing)

504
00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:39.750
(She raps freely with her own sense of rhythm.)

505
00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:43.760
(Her voice is rhythmical, and her pronunciation is clear.)

506
00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:52.330
(Dancing)

507
00:29:57.970 --> 00:29:59.240
I love her energy.

508
00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:01.040
It's great.

509
00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:08.150
(Her energy is bright and refreshing.)

510
00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:10.310
(They're excited.)

511
00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:26.060
(The rhythm pops like fresh fruits.)

512
00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:03.100
(It feels great as it is now.)

513
00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:28.830
(Don't regret the past or worry about the future.)

514
00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:31.430
(What's important is now)

515
00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:48.450
(Her high notes chase away all the worries.)

516
00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:07.770
(Strawberry Girl's energy soars like a rocket.)

517
00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:23.650
(Refreshing Strawberry Girl gives an energetic performance.)

518
00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:28.390
(It's a party.)

519
00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:31.160
- It was a clean performance. - It was strong.

520
00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:34.930
I now realize that she might not be a singer.

521
00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:38.030
I told you she is a rapper.

522
00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:40.800
Opposing her...

523
00:32:41.170 --> 00:32:42.700
is a man with a mysterious voice...

524
00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:45.300
who beat Kim Jae Woo, a comedian.

525
00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:50.480
It's No Human Work, Mysterious Circles!

526
00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:56.350
(Come to the mysterious world of music.)

527
00:32:57.580 --> 00:32:59.120
(I invite you.)

528
00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:02.150
(Please do invite us.)

529
00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:04.990
I can't wait for his performance.

530
00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:06.020
(The panelists focus on him.)

531
00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:10.730
I really want to know who he is. He is a mysterious man.

532
00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:13.900
(He sings confidently.)

533
00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:17.470
(He is a veteran vocalist with much experience.)

534
00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:19.500
I mean this as a compliment.

535
00:33:20.170 --> 00:33:21.410
He is absolutely crazy.

536
00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:25.380
(Mysterious Circles versus Red Mouth)

537
00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:27.480
(Everyone is expectant for a match between the crazy vocalists.)

538
00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:31.780
(That's why they look forward to the solo performance.)

539
00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:38.320
(His voice impressions transcend genders.)

540
00:33:39.790 --> 00:33:42.230
(Even his specialty is amazing.)

541
00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:47.000
(The more they see, the more curious they become.)

542
00:33:47.770 --> 00:33:49.670
(Who could he be?)

543
00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:52.240
(He makes his opponent nervous.)

544
00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:56.310
(Mysterious Circles' mysterious performance begins.)

545
00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:05.250
("Illusion" by Park Ji Yoon)

546
00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:08.250
(His song choice surprises the panelists.)

547
00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:09.250
"Illusion" by Park Ji Yoon.

548
00:34:09.250 --> 00:34:10.290
(His song choice surprises the panelists.)

549
00:34:10.290 --> 00:34:11.590
My goodness.

550
00:34:12.390 --> 00:34:13.590
Will he sing "Illusion"?

551
00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:16.030
(Even women find it hard to pull off the high vocal range.)

552
00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:22.930
(They are curious to listen to Mysterious Circles' "Illusion".)

553
00:34:29.010 --> 00:34:31.040
(My goodness.)

554
00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:37.050
(He is completely different from Round One.)

555
00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:38.880
(Who is he?)

556
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:58.340
(His voice draws people in.)

557
00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:13.150
(Impressed)

558
00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:34.770
(He sings the song with a man's true voice.)

559
00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:45.650
(He is so good.)

560
00:35:47.090 --> 00:35:49.490
(The mysterious performance moves the heart.)

561
00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:51.720
(Is he a ballad singer?)

562
00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:52.860
Is he a ballad singer?

563
00:35:55.730 --> 00:35:57.160
(It's so nice.)

564
00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:09.440
(He doesn't embellish his clean voice,)

565
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:14.850
(and his desperate notes make people listen to him with bated breath.)

566
00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:34.730
(The sorrowful sentiments pierce the heart.)

567
00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:03.160
(He expresses his regrets with his voice alone.)

568
00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:10.900
(My goodness.)

569
00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:24.580
(His sorrowful cry sways the audience's feelings.)

570
00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:32.590
(He is incredible.)

571
00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:42.500
(He has resonance that is sorrowful and deep.)

572
00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:12.430
(The pain of a breakup colors his melancholy voice.)

573
00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:25.880
(Mysterious Circles' "Illusion" captivated everyone.)

574
00:38:27.850 --> 00:38:29.380
(Ho Young has figured out who he is.)

575
00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:32.450
I have no idea who he is.

576
00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:33.850
I am 100 percent sure he is a singer.

577
00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:38.120
The second match of Round Two came to an end.

578
00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:40.320
Hyun Chul, how did you like them?

579
00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:43.830
I am not saying this because Strawberry Girl sang badly.

580
00:38:43.830 --> 00:38:47.130
Given her other talent,

581
00:38:47.130 --> 00:38:50.540
I think she could be a singer-turned-actress...

582
00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:55.510
or an actress who can sing very well.

583
00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:57.980
- What makes you think that? - In the middle,

584
00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:03.180
she showed her ad-libs like this.

585
00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:04.580
What are you singing?

586
00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:13.320
(Singing)

587
00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:15.390
(Look at that ad-lib.)

588
00:39:15.590 --> 00:39:20.060
She hummed in a way...

589
00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:24.570
that seemed to be premeditated.

590
00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:28.140
Singers hum that way...

591
00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:31.410
when they are really excited...

592
00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:33.880
or want to change up the atmosphere.

593
00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:36.680
However, she made it sound like it was planned.

594
00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:39.850
She sang it like this.

595
00:39:39.850 --> 00:39:42.020
It suggests...

596
00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:46.860
she practiced a lot for her performance.

597
00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:52.130
She is a singer-turned-actress or an actress who can sing well.

598
00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:54.130
I think we hear it that way...

599
00:39:54.130 --> 00:39:56.830
because we have been in the music industry for so long.

600
00:39:56.830 --> 00:39:59.800
The mechanical ad-lib...

601
00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:01.640
can lack the natural charms.

602
00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:03.980
You know,

603
00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:07.710
when you open a drawer,

604
00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:10.180
the items should be scattered a bit to look like it's been used.

605
00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:12.080
However, Strawberry Girl's drawer...

606
00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:14.920
has all items neatly packaged...

607
00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:17.990
in beautiful boxes.

608
00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:20.560
That's how cleanly she sings.

609
00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:22.290
Her ad-libs...

610
00:40:22.290 --> 00:40:26.060
could sound unnatural.

611
00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:29.170
- As for Mysterious Circles, - Mysterious Circles.

612
00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:31.640
his low voice is so rich...

613
00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:33.540
that it draws you in.

614
00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:35.110
His high voice...

615
00:40:35.110 --> 00:40:38.510
has a twist that captivates your ears.

616
00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:42.010
He has two different voices.

617
00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:43.510
- It's an advantage. - Yes.

618
00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:44.520
Jang Hyuk.

619
00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:48.520
My opinion is completely different from Hyun Chul's.

620
00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:49.950
- Is it? - Yes.

621
00:40:49.950 --> 00:40:54.160
While Strawberry Girl isn't spontaneous,

622
00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:57.100
her sense of rhythm is exceptional...

623
00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:59.630
when she raps or sings.

624
00:40:59.630 --> 00:41:02.470
1, 2, 3. It's not about counting.

625
00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:04.770
The rhythm must flow inside your body.

626
00:41:04.770 --> 00:41:07.940
She has a good rhythm inside her body.

627
00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:08.940
(I agree.)

628
00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:12.040
That's why I don't agree with Hyun Chul.

629
00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:14.950
- So I think she's a musician. - She's a singer?

630
00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:19.380
Mysterious Circles didn't sound like that last week.

631
00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:20.720
I'm sure he altered his voice.

632
00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:24.360
He squeezed his vocal cords to make a different voice.

633
00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:26.920
But for this performance, he just sang comfortably...

634
00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:28.860
with his vocal cords relaxed.

635
00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:34.270
(He squeezed his vocal cords in Round One.)

636
00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:41.040
(He sang with his vocal cords relaxed in Round Two.)

637
00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:45.940
The way he sings is a little old-fashioned.

638
00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:48.380
- Is he old? - It's not that he's old.

639
00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:50.280
But it didn't sound like the way young people sing.

640
00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:51.420
Which generation would that be?

641
00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:52.480
Is he about Kan Mi Youn's age?

642
00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:54.950
I think he's younger than Kan Mi Youn.

643
00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:56.150
He's younger than her?

644
00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:57.420
He's like the third generation idol star.

645
00:41:57.420 --> 00:41:58.420
- The third generation. - I think so.

646
00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:00.630
- The 3rd generation idol? - The 3rd generation idol.

647
00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:01.990
I think so.

648
00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:06.760
He has the singing style of SM or JYP.

649
00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:09.230
I felt that way as he sang.

650
00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:12.400
He sounds a lot different from last week.

651
00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:14.270
I'm very confused now.

652
00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:16.410
He took off the robe...

653
00:42:16.410 --> 00:42:18.240
when he danced last week.

654
00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:20.210
(When he took off the robe,)

655
00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:23.150
(they could see his slender figure.)

656
00:42:23.850 --> 00:42:27.320
There was a man who came to my mind at that moment.

657
00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:29.190
I see. Stop it.

658
00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:31.260
- So... - Stop speaking.

659
00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:36.130
He's singing in many different ways now.

660
00:42:36.130 --> 00:42:39.360
I think that's because he's trying to hide his identity.

661
00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:41.370
- My gosh. - That's my guess.

662
00:42:41.370 --> 00:42:43.900
- Last week... - Stop speaking.

663
00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:46.600
What did I say?

664
00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:48.810
You don't know what I was going to say.

665
00:42:48.810 --> 00:42:51.610
Why would you tell me to stop? All I said is "Last week."

666
00:42:51.610 --> 00:42:53.850
- Do you know who he is? - You should listen to me first.

667
00:42:53.850 --> 00:42:56.010
- Last week... - He went too far.

668
00:42:56.010 --> 00:43:00.050
He sang against Kim Jae Woo last week.

669
00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:01.990
- That's right. - So...

670
00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:04.560
- I thought he's in the same team. - Namolla Family?

671
00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:07.090
Yes. I thought he's Ko Jang Hwan of Namolla Family.

672
00:43:07.090 --> 00:43:08.730
You mean him?

673
00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:11.360
But as I saw him sing in Round Two,

674
00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:13.030
I reflected on myself.

675
00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:15.500
- She just came clean. - I'm glad that I didn't say it.

676
00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:17.870
- She came clean. - In this round,

677
00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:20.300
- he sounded totally different. - I agree.

678
00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:22.470
I was surprised see that.

679
00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:24.340
He's very mysterious.

680
00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:28.680
When you play basketball, what makes your opponent mad...

681
00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:30.920
is scoring after getting the rebound.

682
00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:33.580
- Exactly. - It's like a free ride.

683
00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:35.820
Getting a rebound is all about positioning.

684
00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:37.320
Let's say we have a hoop right here.

685
00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:42.260
I'm getting a lot of information from them like getting rebounds.

686
00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:43.260
I see.

687
00:43:43.530 --> 00:43:44.960
(As the panelists guess who they are among themselves,)

688
00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:47.300
(Gu Ra picks up various information.)

689
00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:53.340
I heard this three times, and it surprised me.

690
00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:55.470
If Mysterious Circles is him,

691
00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:59.480
it means he gave up his old singing style...

692
00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:02.180
and is trying a new singing style.

693
00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:04.520
- Is he famous? - He's famous.

694
00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:07.050
- Do I know him? - I was very surprised.

695
00:44:07.050 --> 00:44:09.420
He can't be Ko Jang Hwan. No way.

696
00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:11.320
- My gosh. - I'm sorry.

697
00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:14.960
- He sang Park Ji Yoon's song. - Yes.

698
00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:18.530
Ji Yoon was in JYP when she released this song.

699
00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:21.530
She sang it in falsetto.

700
00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:24.640
But he sang it with a man's voice.

701
00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:26.540
It sounded different.

702
00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:29.410
I guess he was also in JYP.

703
00:44:29.410 --> 00:44:33.280
But his singing style is different from what Park Jin Young pursues.

704
00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:35.180
I think he has a lot of complaints against Park Jin Young.

705
00:44:35.180 --> 00:44:36.850
He knows who he is.

706
00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:39.150
- Did you hear the information? - So...

707
00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:42.120
- I didn't hear anything. - He got the idea.

708
00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:43.350
He only knows that he used to be in JYP.

709
00:44:43.350 --> 00:44:44.790
Really?

710
00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:46.960
I think he has complaints.

711
00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:49.030
He has complaints against JYP.

712
00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:50.930
He got a weird idea.

713
00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:54.100
I think that's what it is.

714
00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:56.070
As you heard his voice,

715
00:44:56.070 --> 00:44:58.700
you could tell he has complaints against JYP?

716
00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:00.200
That's because...

717
00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:03.470
you know what Park Jin Young pursued at the time.

718
00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:06.510
What he pursued was "Half air and half sound".

719
00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:07.910
And this song has the essence...

720
00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:12.450
of Park Ji Yoon's singing style.

721
00:45:12.450 --> 00:45:15.120
But he sang it with his strong voice.

722
00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:17.820
I was just trying to figure out...

723
00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:20.060
his identity with all that even if it doesn't make sense.

724
00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:23.490
As these two masked singers met in Round Two,

725
00:45:23.490 --> 00:45:25.500
we compared their data...

726
00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:29.530
and found out there was the theory of parallel universe between them.

727
00:45:29.530 --> 00:45:33.470
They prepared similar specialties.

728
00:45:33.470 --> 00:45:36.810
First, Strawberry Girl can sing...

729
00:45:36.810 --> 00:45:40.180
any songs like pansori.

730
00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:42.010
She can sing any songs like pansori.

731
00:45:42.010 --> 00:45:43.050
Please show us.

732
00:45:43.050 --> 00:45:44.220
(She sings K-Pop like pansori.)

733
00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:48.690
Red flavor, I’m curious, honey

734
00:45:48.690 --> 00:45:52.960
The strawberry flavor slowly melts as you chew

735
00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:55.660
Why are you leaving me here?

736
00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:57.660
That's it.

737
00:45:57.660 --> 00:45:58.660
(She's so talented.)

738
00:45:59.230 --> 00:46:01.930
She just sang two K-Pop songs.

739
00:46:01.930 --> 00:46:04.570
She showed the traditional sound.

740
00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:09.470
Just like her, Mysterious Circles will show you the traditional sound.

741
00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:10.740
He will show you...

742
00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:14.750
the Swiss traditional sound which is like a chicken sound.

743
00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:15.850
Please show us.

744
00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:19.980
(That small chicken...)

745
00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:22.990
(is called Pipi Handi.)

746
00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:24.690
(Yodelling)

747
00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:26.090
(Yodelling)

748
00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:28.230
(The yodel song would resonate through the Alps.)

749
00:46:28.930 --> 00:46:31.860
(Singing)

750
00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:34.230
(He sets himself on fire to sing the yodel song.)

751
00:46:34.830 --> 00:46:35.870
(Imitating a chicken)

752
00:46:35.870 --> 00:46:37.070
That's it.

753
00:46:37.070 --> 00:46:39.370
(The strange yodel is somewhat addictive.)

754
00:46:39.370 --> 00:46:41.210
It's the traditional sound.

755
00:46:41.210 --> 00:46:43.310
That was very surprising.

756
00:46:43.310 --> 00:46:45.780
There's the theory of parallel universe again.

757
00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:49.680
We asked them to show their specialties,

758
00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:53.820
and they both said their specialty is rhythmic gymnastics.

759
00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:58.090
And they both chose ribbons.

760
00:46:58.090 --> 00:47:02.430
Strawberry Girl will go first.

761
00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:03.430
(Expectant)

762
00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:04.530
All right.

763
00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:07.730
(She looks extraordinary.)

764
00:47:07.730 --> 00:47:09.230
Music, please.

765
00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:11.940
(Splitting her legs)

766
00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:14.910
(She's amazing.)

767
00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:16.610
(She gets up showing off her flexibility.)

768
00:47:16.610 --> 00:47:17.610
My goodness.

769
00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:20.610
(She twirls around like a butterfly.)

770
00:47:20.910 --> 00:47:21.910
My gosh.

771
00:47:22.610 --> 00:47:23.980
(She waves the ribbon freely to the rhythm.)

772
00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:25.880
She's so skilled.

773
00:47:26.550 --> 00:47:27.690
(It's a work of art made with a ribbon.)

774
00:47:27.690 --> 00:47:29.850
The ribbon should not touch the ground.

775
00:47:29.850 --> 00:47:30.860
Oh, no.

776
00:47:31.290 --> 00:47:32.990
(As soon as he says that...)

777
00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:35.490
My gosh. It flew away.

778
00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:38.030
You can't have the ribbon touch the ground.

779
00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:40.870
She stepped on it.

780
00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:41.870
(Provoking)

781
00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:43.870
That's good.

782
00:47:45.570 --> 00:47:46.640
That's it.

783
00:47:48.310 --> 00:47:49.370
That was great.

784
00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:53.580
It's Mysterious Circles' turn now.

785
00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:56.350
Music, please.

786
00:47:57.380 --> 00:47:58.450
(As the music starts,)

787
00:47:58.750 --> 00:47:59.820
(he changes.)

788
00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:03.350
He looks so charismatic.

789
00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:06.590
The ribbon is relatively short.

790
00:48:06.590 --> 00:48:08.690
(It's much shorter than Strawberry Girl's ribbon.)

791
00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:11.030
(You got me.)

792
00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:13.600
It looks like he's playing with fire.

793
00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:16.030
It's like a fire in a blaze.

794
00:48:16.570 --> 00:48:18.170
He's dancing with his buttocks.

795
00:48:18.370 --> 00:48:20.070
(Why is he dancing with his buttocks turned around?)

796
00:48:20.970 --> 00:48:22.540
(The stage is heated up with his performance.)

797
00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:25.210
(Here you go.)

798
00:48:25.210 --> 00:48:26.340
That's it.

799
00:48:28.850 --> 00:48:29.850
All right.

800
00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:31.280
(There's the theory of parallel universe between them.)

801
00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:35.490
They just showed their specialties which are similar to each other.

802
00:48:35.490 --> 00:48:38.560
Mi Youn, how did you like their performances?

803
00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:42.460
I was happy to see the great performances of my juniors.

804
00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:44.830
- They are your juniors? - Yes.

805
00:48:44.830 --> 00:48:47.400
Mysterious Circles is trying...

806
00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:50.000
to keep himself suppressed.

807
00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:51.900
(She gives a critical comment.)

808
00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:55.310
But he did show many different sides of himself.

809
00:48:55.310 --> 00:48:57.810
I'm very satisfied as his senior.

810
00:48:57.810 --> 00:49:00.010
You are? All right.

811
00:49:00.010 --> 00:49:02.210
Yoon Seok, what about you?

812
00:49:02.610 --> 00:49:06.350
Strawberry Girl is just as talented...

813
00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:10.590
as anyone who's been on this show.

814
00:49:10.590 --> 00:49:13.930
I think she's a member of an idol group who has a girl crush charm.

815
00:49:14.430 --> 00:49:16.460
That's my guess.

816
00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:18.560
And Mysterious Circles is...

817
00:49:18.830 --> 00:49:20.200
very mysterious.

818
00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:23.170
I was sure he was a rocker last week.

819
00:49:23.170 --> 00:49:26.870
But he sang a ballad song very well this week.

820
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:29.570
And his voice sounds like a popera singer.

821
00:49:29.570 --> 00:49:30.580
A popera singer?

822
00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:32.680
When he dances, he looks like an idol singer.

823
00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:33.710
An idol singer?

824
00:49:33.710 --> 00:49:36.510
But I still think he's a rocker.

825
00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:39.520
I believe he will show us...

826
00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:42.690
his powerful, high-pitched, and clean voice in Round Three.

827
00:49:42.690 --> 00:49:46.090
All right. Yoon Seok thinks he's a rocker.

828
00:49:46.090 --> 00:49:49.260
Now, I will announce the result...

829
00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:52.800
of the second match of Round Two.

830
00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:54.670
Who will move on to the next round...

831
00:49:54.670 --> 00:49:57.870
and sing against Torch Man?

832
00:49:57.870 --> 00:50:02.270
I'll now reveal the winner of this match.

833
00:50:05.610 --> 00:50:07.710
(With her excellent singing and rapping,)

834
00:50:08.210 --> 00:50:09.880
(she fascinated everyone.)

835
00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:13.990
(Strawberry Girl makes people happy.)

836
00:50:15.590 --> 00:50:17.720
(He has a heartrending voice.)

837
00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:23.490
(He sang a beautiful ballad song with his sweet voice.)

838
00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:27.670
(Mysterious Circles is a mysterious vocalist.)

839
00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:31.140
Strawberry Girl versus Mysterious Circles.

840
00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:34.310
Who's the winner of this match?

841
00:50:34.540 --> 00:50:37.080
The winner is...

842
00:50:37.810 --> 00:50:40.010
- The winner is... - The winner is...

843
00:50:40.650 --> 00:50:42.950
(They both have their own unique colors.)

844
00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:46.480
(Who will be singing again in the next round?)

845
00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:49.990
The winner is...

846
00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:51.390
Who's the winner?

847
00:50:51.390 --> 00:50:53.320
Please show us.

848
00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:54.490
(It's No Human Work, Mysterious Circles wins.)

849
00:50:54.490 --> 00:50:55.960
Mysterious Circles wins.

850
00:50:56.830 --> 00:51:01.800
(His limit is a mystery.)

851
00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:05.340
I want to hear him shout in the next round.

852
00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:09.570
The score is 67 to 32.

853
00:51:09.810 --> 00:51:13.240
With the final score of 67 to 32, you won.

854
00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:16.250
Please move to the backstage, and prepare for Round Three.

855
00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:17.880
Please give it up for him.

856
00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:20.220
(Strawberry Girl's identity will soon be revealed.)

857
00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:23.490
This is crazy. This is mad.

858
00:51:24.990 --> 00:51:26.920
I think they already found out who I am.

859
00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:28.560
(He laughs.)

860
00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:29.960
Since I made it,

861
00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:33.360
I will explode my emotions.

862
00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:34.730
I can do this.

863
00:51:34.730 --> 00:51:36.300
(Did people really find out who he is?)

864
00:51:36.570 --> 00:51:39.100
Some predicted that she is a member of a girl group.

865
00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:41.270
Some said she is a rapper.

866
00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:43.010
We made many guesses.

867
00:51:43.110 --> 00:51:45.610
Let's see who she really is.

868
00:51:45.610 --> 00:51:47.810
Please move to the back of the stage.

869
00:51:48.610 --> 00:51:51.750
Now, Strawberry Girl, please take off your mask...

870
00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:53.650
and reveal your face.

871
00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:56.190
(They first predicted her to be a rapper,)

872
00:51:56.190 --> 00:51:58.890
(then a girl group member,)

873
00:51:58.890 --> 00:52:01.090
(and finally an actress who used to be a singer.)

874
00:52:02.590 --> 00:52:05.300
(She could even do pansori.)

875
00:52:06.430 --> 00:52:09.300
(Who is this talented masked singer?)

876
00:52:10.170 --> 00:52:11.900
Please reveal your face.

877
00:52:14.470 --> 00:52:15.970
(Screaming)

878
00:52:17.140 --> 00:52:18.680
(Screaming)

879
00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:21.110
- Who is it? - Who is it?

880
00:52:21.110 --> 00:52:22.980
They are genuinely surprised.

881
00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:24.450
They are screaming.

882
00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:26.880
She is...

883
00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:33.560
She is the main vocalist of T-ara who is also an actress.

884
00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:35.160
She is Hahm Eun Jung.

885
00:52:36.590 --> 00:52:37.600
(It's Eun Jung of T-ara!)

886
00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.300
(No way!)

887
00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:42.600
(They never expected it to be her.)

888
00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:43.630
Is she Eun Jung?

889
00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:45.300
No way.

890
00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:46.370
(I can't believe it.)

891
00:52:46.370 --> 00:52:48.970
Can you say hello to the viewers?

892
00:52:49.370 --> 00:52:52.710
Hello. I am Hahm Eun Jung of T-ara.

893
00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:57.780
(She's the vocalist of T-ara, which debuted in 2009.)

894
00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:00.650
(They led the retro craze in Korea...)

895
00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:04.020
(and Korean Wave in China.)

896
00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:06.360
(They're popular not only in Korea...)

897
00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:08.660
(but also in all over Asia.)

898
00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:12.060
(They proved themselves as the globally popular girl group.)

899
00:53:13.130 --> 00:53:15.500
(She is also a great actress.)

900
00:53:16.330 --> 00:53:18.170
(And she was a big hit on variety shows as well.)

901
00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:19.840
(She won awards from not only Drama Awards...)

902
00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:22.010
(but also Entertainment Awards.)

903
00:53:22.710 --> 00:53:23.880
Thank you.

904
00:53:24.210 --> 00:53:26.280
(Recently, she got to play a lead character in a drama.)

905
00:53:27.210 --> 00:53:29.980
(She successfully established herself as an actress.)

906
00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:33.480
(She constantly challenges herself and wins everyone's approval.)

907
00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:37.690
(Eun Jung is an artist with multiple talents.)

908
00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:41.130
Recently, she starred in a drama.

909
00:53:41.130 --> 00:53:42.330
- "Sisters-in-Law". - "Sisters-in-Law".

910
00:53:42.330 --> 00:53:44.800
- She was the lead actress. - She acted with Kang Kyung Jun.

911
00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:47.530
She's beloved by all generations.

912
00:53:47.530 --> 00:53:52.040
Because of your hair style, people claim...

913
00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:54.240
that the person in the drama is not the same person...

914
00:53:54.470 --> 00:53:57.380
as the person on stage.

915
00:53:57.380 --> 00:54:02.210
Right. Perhaps because people are used to seeing me with short hair,

916
00:54:02.210 --> 00:54:05.720
people didn't recognize me when I had long hair.

917
00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:08.950
So I thought I would confuse you...

918
00:54:08.950 --> 00:54:12.920
if I sing on stage with long hair.

919
00:54:13.090 --> 00:54:15.030
It was thrilling.

920
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:17.530
- Nobody recognized you. - Right.

921
00:54:17.530 --> 00:54:21.000
I occasionally watched "Sisters-in-Law".

922
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.400
My talent is to watch one episode...

923
00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:25.500
and to pretend that I have seen the whole thing.

924
00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:29.210
She's very active as an actress,

925
00:54:29.410 --> 00:54:33.380
and I was amazed by how talented she is.

926
00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:36.580
T-ara debuted on "Radio Star".

927
00:54:36.580 --> 00:54:37.580
- Right. - Right.

928
00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:39.350
I really missed him.

929
00:54:39.350 --> 00:54:40.650
- You missed Gu Ra? - Yes.

930
00:54:40.650 --> 00:54:43.790
I remember him helping us a lot...

931
00:54:43.790 --> 00:54:45.090
- when we just debuted. - I assisted them.

932
00:54:45.090 --> 00:54:46.660
So I...

933
00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:48.790
(Voice imitation is a must for rookies.)

934
00:54:49.230 --> 00:54:50.630
You can stop now.

935
00:54:50.730 --> 00:54:52.330
(Did he really help her?)

936
00:54:52.900 --> 00:54:55.800
When I got invited here, I told the writers...

937
00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:57.440
- that I can't wait to see him. - Eun Jung is...

938
00:54:57.440 --> 00:54:59.370
I am very happy to see her again.

939
00:54:59.370 --> 00:55:02.440
- Thank you. - She's thanking him only now.

940
00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:03.910
(She finally got to thank him.)

941
00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:06.540
I personally know Eun Jung.

942
00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:07.950
We went to the same school.

943
00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:11.180
- Did you? - Yes. We went to the same school.

944
00:55:11.180 --> 00:55:13.850
I didn't know that it was Eun Jung.

945
00:55:13.850 --> 00:55:16.890
But I loved listening to her voice once again.

946
00:55:16.890 --> 00:55:19.220
Her voice was as refreshing as strawberries,

947
00:55:19.220 --> 00:55:22.590
and she's still very beautiful. It made me really happy.

948
00:55:22.590 --> 00:55:24.000
- Thank you. - All right.

949
00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:26.730
I wonder...

950
00:55:26.730 --> 00:55:29.770
if this is how the panelists felt when I was on stage.

951
00:55:29.770 --> 00:55:31.170
I had no clue.

952
00:55:31.170 --> 00:55:33.070
We used to perform together during the same period,

953
00:55:33.070 --> 00:55:34.540
but I had no idea.

954
00:55:34.540 --> 00:55:36.340
After many years,

955
00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:38.140
she has improved tremendously.

956
00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:41.950
I felt proud watching her.

957
00:55:41.950 --> 00:55:43.950
I will continue to cheer for her.

958
00:55:43.950 --> 00:55:45.350
- She did very well. - Thank you.

959
00:55:45.350 --> 00:55:48.650
She will have similar worries as Mi Youn.

960
00:55:48.650 --> 00:55:50.490
And I'm sure Mi Youn can help her.

961
00:55:50.490 --> 00:55:52.920
Eun Jung gained more confidence...

962
00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:55.360
through this experience.

963
00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:56.730
Please give it up for her.

964
00:55:56.730 --> 00:55:58.000
(We hope Eun Jung will soar high.)

965
00:55:58.000 --> 00:55:59.260
Thank you.

966
00:55:59.830 --> 00:56:01.900
(We will cheer for you.)

967
00:56:03.470 --> 00:56:05.000
It was really fun.

968
00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.000
"You didn't know it was me, did you?"

969
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.370
That was quite fun.

970
00:56:09.370 --> 00:56:11.880
If I didn't have the mask on,

971
00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:15.510
I wouldn't have dared to speak in a cute way like that.

972
00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:18.520
The mask had a power...

973
00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:21.590
to make me do the impossible.

974
00:56:21.590 --> 00:56:23.890
I had a lot of fun.

975
00:56:24.060 --> 00:56:28.690
It made me realize that there are people who like my voice.

976
00:56:28.690 --> 00:56:31.130
And that gave me confidence.

977
00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:33.400
Also, this experience made me realize...

978
00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:36.830
what I need to work on and what needs improvement.

979
00:56:36.900 --> 00:56:39.500
In the end, it was an opportunity...

980
00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:42.710
for me to grow my confidence.

981
00:56:44.780 --> 00:56:47.510
It was really fun today.

982
00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:50.880
I hope King of Mask Singer will delight your ears.

983
00:56:53.050 --> 00:56:54.490
This is so embarrassing.

984
00:56:56.520 --> 00:56:59.990
Mysterious Circles beat Eun Jung of T-ara...

985
00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:01.590
and made it to Round Three.

986
00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:03.260
Shortly.

987
00:57:03.900 --> 00:57:05.560
(The strong contestants...)

988
00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:06.630
(will freely control the audience.)

989
00:57:07.060 --> 00:57:08.800
(Is the queen worried?)

990
00:57:09.330 --> 00:57:10.330
(Nobody knows what is going to happen.)

991
00:57:11.070 --> 00:57:12.500
(Will a new legend be born?)

992
00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:13.540
(Or will the queen win for the 5th time?)

993
00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:15.240
(The shocking result...)

994
00:57:15.710 --> 00:57:17.580
(will be shortly revealed.)

995
00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:19.840
The mysterious music show, King of Mask Singer.

996
00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:22.380
To stop Red Mouth from winning for the fifth time,

997
00:57:22.380 --> 00:57:25.910
two masked singers have made to Final Round.

998
00:57:25.910 --> 00:57:28.150
Let's bring them in again.

999
00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:30.090
Please give it up for them.

1000
00:57:32.650 --> 00:57:33.890
Torch Man...

1001
00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:37.360
and Mysterious Circles...

1002
00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:39.760
made it to Round Three.

1003
00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:42.330
I will give you a chance to say something to the queen.

1004
00:57:42.430 --> 00:57:44.970
You are really good.

1005
00:57:44.970 --> 00:57:47.900
Facing you, I feel even more nervous.

1006
00:57:48.170 --> 00:57:50.240
I will just face the front and do my best.

1007
00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:54.140
Torch Man said he will just go on his way.

1008
00:57:54.140 --> 00:57:55.680
Mysterious Circles.

1009
00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:58.310
The queen...

1010
00:57:58.310 --> 00:58:00.880
has an unbelievable aura.

1011
00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:03.150
But my outfit is unbelievable too.

1012
00:58:03.150 --> 00:58:04.890
It is unbelievable.

1013
00:58:04.890 --> 00:58:06.760
If I ever become the king,

1014
00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:08.820
this outfit would be very fitting.

1015
00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:09.890
Right.

1016
00:58:10.090 --> 00:58:11.590
What do you think, my queen?

1017
00:58:11.590 --> 00:58:13.330
They have made this far.

1018
00:58:13.330 --> 00:58:16.600
This is the most nerve-wrecking day for me.

1019
00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:19.630
There have been bad omens.

1020
00:58:19.630 --> 00:58:23.410
I always use the same cubicle in the ladies' room.

1021
00:58:23.410 --> 00:58:25.270
It wasn't intentional.

1022
00:58:25.270 --> 00:58:28.210
The last cubicle just happened to be empty all the time.

1023
00:58:28.210 --> 00:58:31.950
So I comfortably spent my time alone.

1024
00:58:31.950 --> 00:58:33.320
- But today, - Today?

1025
00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:35.950
- I went there four times. - You did?

1026
00:58:35.950 --> 00:58:38.020
And that cubicle was occupied every time.

1027
00:58:38.020 --> 00:58:40.420
Was it never free?

1028
00:58:40.420 --> 00:58:42.060
- No. - What could this mean?

1029
00:58:42.060 --> 00:58:43.590
I know that cubicle.

1030
00:58:43.730 --> 00:58:46.160
I think the cleaning lady locked that cubicle.

1031
00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:48.500
I like that cubicle too.

1032
00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:50.500
- Do you? - But the door was locked.

1033
00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:51.900
- Is that right? - It made her comfortable.

1034
00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:54.940
I knock on that door every time I go there.

1035
00:58:55.170 --> 00:58:58.110
And there was nobody knocking back.

1036
00:58:58.110 --> 00:59:00.480
- Nobody answered. - So I suspected that it's locked.

1037
00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:04.680
Don't think of it as a bad omen and free yourself from the thought.

1038
00:59:04.780 --> 00:59:07.080
That's what I wanted to tell you.

1039
00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:09.850
The queen is very worried,

1040
00:59:09.850 --> 00:59:13.920
anxious, and nervous. This might be a chance for them.

1041
00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:17.060
Now, Round Three, Final Round will begin.

1042
00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:20.630
Torch Man will perform first.

1043
00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:23.370
(Go, Torch Man!)

1044
00:59:26.130 --> 00:59:27.570
- I am so excited. - I am excited.

1045
00:59:27.570 --> 00:59:28.570
(We are excited to hear Torch Man's charming voice.)

1046
00:59:28.570 --> 00:59:30.310
If he didn't choose a good song, I will be upset.

1047
00:59:30.410 --> 00:59:31.440
(Laughing)

1048
00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:32.710
Don't be nervous.

1049
00:59:32.710 --> 00:59:35.410
(Everyone is expecting a lot from Torch Man.)

1050
00:59:36.580 --> 00:59:38.180
(Will he be able to mesmerize the panelists again...)

1051
00:59:38.180 --> 00:59:40.620
(and get a chance to compete against the queen?)

1052
00:59:42.050 --> 00:59:44.520
(How will Torch Man perform?)

1053
00:59:47.690 --> 00:59:51.990
("Love Me Right" by EXO)

1054
00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:53.260
The tempo is fast.

1055
00:59:53.260 --> 00:59:54.460
- My gosh. - EXO?

1056
00:59:54.460 --> 00:59:57.830
(He's going to sing EXO's song?)

1057
00:59:58.870 --> 01:00:04.840
(Torch Man chose a song that raises our expectations.)

1058
01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:14.980
(Staring)

1059
01:00:15.650 --> 01:00:16.650
(My goodness.)

1060
01:00:18.350 --> 01:00:22.160
(Torch Man starts to rap.)

1061
01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:25.390
(His rapping skill is stunning.)

1062
01:00:25.530 --> 01:00:26.630
(He gets up.)

1063
01:00:27.730 --> 01:00:32.030
(His magical voice made him stand up.)

1064
01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:37.510
(Dancing)

1065
01:00:39.670 --> 01:00:46.480
(He sings EXO's song alone without any problems.)

1066
01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:28.060
(Saxophone!)

1067
01:01:32.130 --> 01:01:34.260
(This is exciting!)

1068
01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:39.840
(Everyone dances excitedly to the rhythm.)

1069
01:02:05.130 --> 01:02:06.330
(He turns around.)

1070
01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:07.430
(Screaming)

1071
01:02:07.930 --> 01:02:10.430
(Today on King of Mask Singer, I'm EXO.)

1072
01:02:10.430 --> 01:02:11.500
(He's awesome.)

1073
01:02:11.930 --> 01:02:18.740
(He can freely control his falsetto and real tone.)

1074
01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:24.450
(He sings accurately in tune with his unique voice,)

1075
01:02:24.810 --> 01:02:28.750
(which makes this performance perfect.)

1076
01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:30.850
(He's too good!)

1077
01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.870
(This is incredible!)

1078

(It was a wonderful performance!)

1086
01:03:38.420 --> 01:03:40.260
Let's party tonight! Let's party tonight!

1087
01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:42.390
- Who is he? - I seriously have no idea.

1088
01:03:42.420 --> 01:03:44.130
- He's amazing. - I have no idea.

1089
01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:46.190
- I have no idea. - He sings in a very unique way.

1090
01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:48.100
I feel like my nose is cleared up.

1091
01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:49.200
He's so charming.

1092
01:03:50.030 --> 01:03:51.200
- He was amazing. - Right?

1093
01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:52.700
Here comes his opponent.

1094
01:03:52.970 --> 01:03:56.040
He beat Comedian Kim Jae Woo and Singer Hahm Eun Jung.

1095
01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:58.940
This musical creature made an emergency landing on our hearts.

1096
01:03:59.210 --> 01:04:03.310
It's No Human Work, Mysterious Circles.

1097
01:04:03.310 --> 01:04:04.980
(It's No Human Work, Mysterious Circles)

1098

He definitely has charisma.

1103
01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:16.760
I wonder which song he will sing.

1104
01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:18.790
He looks really comfortable on the stage.

1105
01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:21.730
(He came striding to Round Three.)

1106
01:04:22.230 --> 01:04:25.270
(He has to beat his rival and compete against the queen.)

1107
01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:28.800
(How will he attract the panelists?)

1108
01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:41.880
("Believe" by TVXQ)

1109
01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:43.520

01:05:09.310 --> 01:05:14.650
(His voice is calmer than in the previous rounds.)

1113
01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:27.900
(His voice expresses the pure feelings of love.)

1114

He's good.

01:08:42.820 --> 01:08:44.260
It sounds beautiful when he sings high notes.

1141
01:08:44.890 --> 01:08:49.300
Final Round is now over.

1142
01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:51.570
What do you think, Red Mouth?

1143
01:08:51.570 --> 01:08:54.240
I'd like to hear how you liked their performances.

1144
01:08:54.700 --> 01:08:55.800
(Sighing)

1145
01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:58.140
I'm not sure. Since the last cubicle in the ladies' room was locked...

1146
01:08:58.140 --> 01:08:59.910
Oh, no. The locked cubicle still bothers you.

1147
01:08:59.910 --> 01:09:02.340
Both their performances were really great.

1148
01:09:02.910 --> 01:09:06.280
I'm sure you prepared a performance that is as good as theirs.

1149
01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:08.280
As weeks go by,

1150
01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:12.450
I choose songs, thinking this might be my last performance.

1151
01:09:12.450 --> 01:09:14.090
That's what I think when I practice.

1152
01:09:14.590 --> 01:09:17.390
Especially the lyrics of the song...

1153
01:09:17.390 --> 01:09:21.160
I chose for today are what I want to say...

1154
01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:24.430
to the viewers and audience.

1155
01:09:24.430 --> 01:09:27.640
If you keep your winning streak, you're breaking the record.

1156
01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:32.210
Your winning streak will be third longest ever.

1157
01:09:32.210 --> 01:09:35.080
Now, you can go get ready for Final Match.

1158
01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:37.310
- Please give it up for her! - You can do it!

1159
01:09:37.350 --> 01:09:38.380
(See you soon.)

1160
01:09:39.780 --> 01:09:41.820
She'll get ready for Final Match.

1161
01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:44.820
I wonder how you liked their performances in Round Three.

1162
01:09:44.820 --> 01:09:46.020
Young Seok?

1163
01:09:46.350 --> 01:09:50.160
In Round Two, aside from his singing skills,

1164
01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:53.230
Torch Man's performance...

1165
01:09:53.230 --> 01:09:54.660
pierced my heart.

1166
01:09:54.660 --> 01:09:57.100
It was really touching.

1167
01:09:57.100 --> 01:09:59.370
However, Round Three...

1168
01:09:59.770 --> 01:10:01.440
was way too good.

1169
01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:03.000
It was way too good?

1170
01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.540
There's this band called Jamiroquai.

1171
01:10:06.010 --> 01:10:07.880
(World's famous electronic sound super star)

1172
01:10:08.510 --> 01:10:10.580
He plays with rhythms well.

1173
01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:12.650
Torch Man reminds me of him.

1174
01:10:12.650 --> 01:10:19.350
His voice notes are as accurate as the synthesizers.

1175
01:10:19.350 --> 01:10:22.560
He's scary in a way that people usually sing touching songs...

1176
01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:24.460
in Round Three.

1177
01:10:24.460 --> 01:10:27.430
He not only touched people's hearts but also has excellent techniques.

1178
01:10:27.430 --> 01:10:30.330
He just proved that he's good.

1179
01:10:30.330 --> 01:10:34.340
It's like beyond the legendary...

1180
01:10:34.340 --> 01:10:37.110
rhythm and blues singers we all know.

1181
01:10:37.610 --> 01:10:41.310
I think he has pulled out the red card to...

1182
01:10:41.310 --> 01:10:42.880
Red Mouth.

1183
01:10:43.850 --> 01:10:46.620
(His unique voice has dominated the stage.)

1184
01:10:47.350 --> 01:10:48.350
(Perfect tunes and rhythms)

1185
01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:50.190
(Here's the red card.)

1186
01:10:50.750 --> 01:10:53.020
(No, this is my seat!)

1187
01:10:53.090 --> 01:10:57.930
Whereas Torch Man looks like some millionaire,

1188
01:10:57.930 --> 01:11:00.060
Mysterious Circles is like a super rich.

1189
01:11:00.060 --> 01:11:04.070
He's rich with singing skills. His songs are full of essentials.

1190
01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:07.340
His singing skills are very useful.

1191
01:11:07.340 --> 01:11:09.000
His song doesn't fly away.

1192
01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:13.040
It calms people down in warmness.

1193
01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:14.380
It's very fresh.

1194
01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:17.980
I think this point has touched hearts of many women.

1195
01:11:17.980 --> 01:11:19.110
All right.

1196
01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:23.120
Kim Hyun Chul's watching the stage with a serious face.

1197
01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:26.050
Mysterious Circles' vibration...

1198
01:11:26.050 --> 01:11:28.560
from last week...

1199
01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:32.590
are totally different from this week's.

1200
01:11:32.590 --> 01:11:35.800
Last week, his vibration was...

1201
01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:38.130
very wide.

1202
01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:41.000
(Give your worries to the dog next door)

1203
01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:42.440
(Singing)

1204
01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:46.510
But today's vibration was...

1205
01:11:46.510 --> 01:11:50.010
very short and thin.

1206
01:11:50.010 --> 01:11:53.950
He used totally different vibrations.

1207
01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:55.750
In my view,

1208
01:11:55.750 --> 01:11:58.490
he knows how to play with the music.

1209
01:11:58.490 --> 01:12:01.360
But he wanted to express his sincerity towards the viewers.

1210
01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:05.130
So he didn't play with the music.

1211
01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:07.260
He's a singer for sure.

1212
01:12:07.260 --> 01:12:10.670
I'm thinking if he is a musical singer.

1213
01:12:10.670 --> 01:12:11.870
Thank you for your song.

1214
01:12:11.870 --> 01:12:13.770
Torch Man...

1215
01:12:13.770 --> 01:12:16.270
- sounded like Barry White. - Barry White.

1216
01:12:16.270 --> 01:12:18.710
He doesn't make any movements while singing.

1217
01:12:18.710 --> 01:12:20.680
But he sings a disco song.

1218
01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:22.040
- A disco song? - Yes.

1219
01:12:22.580 --> 01:12:25.710
(Accurate techniques along with fast beats)

1220
01:12:26.250 --> 01:12:28.120
(Barry White has made a history in the disco field.)

1221
01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:31.120
He was just like Barry White when he was singing EXO's song.

1222
01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:34.320
His tunes and rhythms were all perfect.

1223
01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:37.160
It can't be more perfect than this.

1224
01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:40.200
The best thing about him...

1225
01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:42.530
- is his voice. - His voice.

1226
01:12:42.530 --> 01:12:46.100
He knows how to sing from the nasal area.

1227
01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:50.510
His nasal voice was very attractive.

1228
01:12:50.510 --> 01:12:54.240
I thought he could be a newbie when he first sang.

1229
01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:58.210
It's because nobody recognized him when he's so good at singing.

1230
01:12:58.210 --> 01:12:59.510
But when I heard him speaking,

1231
01:12:59.510 --> 01:13:01.380
- he felt like a middle-aged man. - A middle-aged man?

1232
01:13:01.380 --> 01:13:04.250
I felt like he's experienced.

1233
01:13:04.250 --> 01:13:06.820
- He sounded like he's experienced. - Yes, that's right.

1234
01:13:06.820 --> 01:13:09.590
So I'm really curious.

1235
01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:10.590
- Who could he be? - Who could he be?

1236
01:13:10.590 --> 01:13:12.430
- It's driving you mad. - Yes.

1237
01:13:12.430 --> 01:13:14.530
What about you, Kai?

1238
01:13:14.530 --> 01:13:18.470
Actors and golfers usually...

1239
01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:20.300
say things like this.

1240
01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:23.410
When they're asked, "Sir, how can I do well?",

1241
01:13:23.410 --> 01:13:24.670
they'd say, "Just relax."

1242
01:13:24.670 --> 01:13:26.480
They say it takes 10 years to relax.

1243
01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:28.840
- You're right. - They say these things.

1244
01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:31.880
But he's too relaxed to say...

1245
01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:34.220
that he's a newbie in the music industry.

1246
01:13:34.220 --> 01:13:36.990
He knows how to enjoy his performances.

1247
01:13:36.990 --> 01:13:39.350
He knows how to relax and play around the stage.

1248
01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:42.860
How can we not know such an excellent singer?

1249
01:13:42.860 --> 01:13:44.830
Mysterious Circles...

1250
01:13:44.830 --> 01:13:47.760
sang after Torch Man.

1251
01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:52.300
He must have been pressured to show off his talents more.

1252
01:13:52.300 --> 01:13:55.640
However, he sang it calmly with his own tempo.

1253
01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:58.910
He didn't overdo it but sang with his genuine skills.

1254
01:13:58.910 --> 01:14:02.810
It's not easy to just show enough talents.

1255
01:14:02.810 --> 01:14:05.250
- He's experienced. - I think so.

1256
01:14:05.250 --> 01:14:08.380
He's experienced and wise.

1257
01:14:08.380 --> 01:14:11.490
He's modest towards songs.

1258
01:14:11.490 --> 01:14:14.390
He's such a ready-to-go singer.

1259
01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:19.160
Torch Man's tunes are very accurate.

1260
01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:22.230
He knows exactly where he has to stress.

1261
01:14:22.230 --> 01:14:25.730
He's like 1,000 percent perfect.

1262
01:14:25.730 --> 01:14:29.910
You know the 10-points target where the camera is in archery?

1263
01:14:29.910 --> 01:14:31.440
- 10 points. - Yes, there.

1264
01:14:31.570 --> 01:14:32.840
He shoots right in the center.

1265
01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:34.140
He shoots it there. It's 10 points.

1266
01:14:34.140 --> 01:14:35.480
Young Seok, do you agree?

1267
01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:36.810
Absolutely.

1268
01:14:36.810 --> 01:14:39.750
His tunes are perfect.

1269
01:14:39.750 --> 01:14:41.220
- Goodness. - And...

1270
01:14:41.220 --> 01:14:44.350
I'll tell you about what I first felt about Torch Man.

1271
01:14:44.350 --> 01:14:46.190
When I listened to his song,

1272
01:14:46.190 --> 01:14:49.360
I felt like I got home after riding the roller coaster of his voice.

1273
01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:51.060
When I listened to Mysterious Circles' voice,

1274
01:14:51.060 --> 01:14:53.260
it was like I was lying in my bed.

1275
01:14:53.260 --> 01:14:55.360
It was so calm and relaxing.

1276
01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:57.370
It felt so cozy.

1277
01:14:57.370 --> 01:14:59.230
He's like telling us how to sing ballad songs.

1278
01:14:59.230 --> 01:15:02.040
He knows how to control his breath and stress points.

1279
01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:06.940
I've totally empathized with the inspiration he was sending.

1280
01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:08.710
I really have no idea.

1281
01:15:08.710 --> 01:15:09.880
I've hypnotized myself.

1282
01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:11.950
I've told myself to think of the restaurants that I like.

1283
01:15:11.950 --> 01:15:15.820
Torch Man is like a lunch set or dinner set.

1284
01:15:15.820 --> 01:15:17.820
- He's like famous for some set. - A restaurant famous for its sets.

1285
01:15:17.820 --> 01:15:20.360
There are various choices.

1286
01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:22.720
- But... - But his mask is a grilled dish.

1287
01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:23.890
(The taste of fire is the best.)

1288
01:15:24.430 --> 01:15:26.290
Mysterious Circles...

1289
01:15:26.290 --> 01:15:28.960
is like some restaurant that's famous for a single special dish.

1290
01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:30.670
- He's known for one dish? - Yes.

1291
01:15:31.230 --> 01:15:33.100
- A restaurant famous for one thing. - Yes.

1292
01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:34.170
He's like that restaurant with one famous menu.

1293
01:15:34.170 --> 01:15:36.170
I have a special recipe. Follow me.

1294
01:15:36.910 --> 01:15:39.240
His voice is definitely specialized.

1295
01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:41.340
Now, we are about the announce...

1296
01:15:41.340 --> 01:15:45.750
the finalist to move on to Final Round.

1297
01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:49.550
Torch Man has great skills of singing like a firework.

1298
01:15:49.550 --> 01:15:53.720
Mysterious Circles knows how to touch people's hearts.

1299
01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:55.790
I'll now reveal that one person...

1300
01:15:55.790 --> 01:15:59.560
who will be the finalist for the 69th King of Mask Singer.

1301
01:16:02.100 --> 01:16:03.500
(Once with an exceptional selection of song)

1302
01:16:04.170 --> 01:16:06.200
(Another time with his amazing voice that goes along the song)

1303
01:16:06.740 --> 01:16:09.770
(Firework on stage that surprised everyone)

1304
01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:12.840
(Competing against Torch Man...)

1305
01:16:13.910 --> 01:16:17.110
(Contrary to Torch Man, his voice is soft and touching.)

1306
01:16:17.750 --> 01:16:23.390
(He has imprinted himself in everyone's heart.)

1307
01:16:23.690 --> 01:16:26.590
Torch Man versus Mysterious Circles.

1308
01:16:26.590 --> 01:16:27.920
The one that's going to compete...

1309
01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:31.530
against Red Mouth is...

1310
01:16:31.530 --> 01:16:33.800
The winner is...

1311
01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:36.600
The winner is...

1312
01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:38.400
The winner is...

1313
01:16:39.130 --> 01:16:40.170
The winner is...

1314
01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:42.440
(Is it going to be Torch Man who sings in perfect tunes?)

1315
01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:46.140
(Is it Mysterious Circles who has a warm voice color?)

1316
01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:49.380
The winner is...

1317
01:16:50.310 --> 01:16:52.350
The winner is...

1318
01:16:52.350 --> 01:16:54.350
(Torch Man wins.)

1319
01:16:54.350 --> 01:16:56.180
It's Torch Man!

1320
01:16:56.550 --> 01:16:57.920
Torch Man!

1321
01:16:58.990 --> 01:17:00.220
(That's right.)

1322
01:17:00.790 --> 01:17:02.160
(It's sad to let Mysterious Circles go.)

1323
01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:04.830
He should have sung some rock music.

1324
01:17:05.830 --> 01:17:08.530
He beat against Mysterious Circles.

1325
01:17:08.830 --> 01:17:12.770
It's 62 to 37.

1326
01:17:12.870 --> 01:17:16.140
The difference is bigger than I expected.

1327
01:17:16.140 --> 01:17:18.970
Torch Man, please move to the back stage.

1328
01:17:18.970 --> 01:17:20.740
You'll watch the queen perform.

1329
01:17:20.740 --> 01:17:22.380
Please give him a round of applause.

1330
01:17:22.380 --> 01:17:24.450
(Mysterious Circles' identity will be revealed soon.)

1331
01:17:24.450 --> 01:17:26.950
Torch Man could be the 69th King of Mask Singer.

1332
01:17:26.950 --> 01:17:29.120
The panelist was fond of me.

1333
01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:30.690
I was very lucky.

1334
01:17:30.850 --> 01:17:31.850
Thank you.

1335
01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:35.460
Mysterious Circles received much compliments. Who could he be?

1336
01:17:35.460 --> 01:17:37.890
We'll now reveal his identity.

1337
01:17:37.890 --> 01:17:39.960
Please come to the back.

1338
01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:45.470
Now, please take off your mask...

1339
01:17:45.470 --> 01:17:47.570
and reveal your face.

1340
01:17:48.870 --> 01:17:51.940
(He's intentionally faking his voice?)

1341
01:17:52.940 --> 01:17:55.980
(He's like a popera singer and an idol at the same time.)

1342
01:17:56.410 --> 01:17:58.350
(He's a singer full of essential skills.)

1343
01:17:59.380 --> 01:18:01.050
(His specialty was great too.)

1344
01:18:01.250 --> 01:18:04.550
Take off your mask, and reveal your face!

1345
01:18:05.290 --> 01:18:06.560
(Screaming)

1346
01:18:07.690 --> 01:18:08.720
(Everyone's shocked.)

1347
01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:09.990
This man is...

1348
01:18:10.060 --> 01:18:11.530
Why? What's wrong?

1349
01:18:11.530 --> 01:18:12.730
What's happening?

1350
01:18:12.730 --> 01:18:14.630
- Who is he? - They've gone crazy.

1351
01:18:14.730 --> 01:18:16.700
Reveal your face.

1352
01:18:21.470 --> 01:18:22.700
He is...

1353
01:18:22.700 --> 01:18:26.480
Jo Kwon who recently came back as a solo artist from 2AM.

1354
01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:29.180
He's the singer, Jo Kwon.

1355
01:18:30.050 --> 01:18:31.910
That's right. Goodness.

1356
01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:34.780
It must have been hard for him to suppress the urge to dance.

1357
01:18:34.980 --> 01:18:35.980
(Hey, Jo Kwon!)

1358
01:18:36.620 --> 01:18:38.050
(It's so good to see him.)

1359
01:18:38.190 --> 01:18:39.960
Please say hello to viewers.

1360
01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:43.230
Hi, I'm Jo Kwon from 2AM. Nice to meet you.

1361
01:18:44.030 --> 01:18:46.660
(He's the legendary of trainees who trained for 8 years.)

1362
01:18:47.730 --> 01:18:52.870
(He made his debut through 2AM with heart-warming voices.)

1363
01:18:53.870 --> 01:18:58.170
(His voice and singing skills are well suited in all genres of music.)

1364
01:18:59.410 --> 01:19:03.980
(His sentimental voice represented the emotions of many ex-boyfriends.)

1365
01:19:04.850 --> 01:19:06.580
(He has won many awards in many music award ceremonies.)

1366
01:19:07.150 --> 01:19:09.080
(His song lighted up hearts of many single men and women.)

1367
01:19:09.750 --> 01:19:12.550
(He was known as a sweet husband in "We Got Married".)

1368
01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:14.120
(And)

1369
01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:17.030
(His pelvis dances were exceptional.)

1370
01:19:17.590 --> 01:19:19.590
(His unique specialty can't be replaced by anyone else.)

1371
01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:22.760
(He's now the new hero in many variety shows.)

1372
01:19:22.900 --> 01:19:26.600
(Everybody loves him as a talented entertainer.)

1373
01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:29.940
(He's now doing musicals with extraordinary talents.)

1374
01:19:30.910 --> 01:19:32.940
(His presence cannot be replaced by anyone else.)

1375
01:19:33.610 --> 01:19:37.380
(His experiences on stage are shown in many characters.)

1376
01:19:37.850 --> 01:19:40.850
(His came back as a solo singer with his new song, "Dawn".)

1377
01:19:43.050 --> 01:19:46.290
(Jo Kwon's warm voice will melt down the coldness.)

1378
01:19:47.290 --> 01:19:50.060
- I've been a singer for 10 years. - That's right.

1379
01:19:50.060 --> 01:19:52.160
I've appeared in so many music shows before.

1380
01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:53.500
I've appeared in many variety shows as well.

1381
01:19:53.530 --> 01:19:55.000
I've never felt more suffocated before.

1382
01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:56.330
(He felt the most suffocated here.)

1383
01:19:56.330 --> 01:19:57.970
Even though you wanted to show your dances,

1384
01:19:57.970 --> 01:19:59.940
you couldn't because you had to be careful not to be recognized.

1385
01:19:59.940 --> 01:20:00.970
So I felt really frustrated.

1386
01:20:00.970 --> 01:20:02.300
Especially when I sang "Napal Baji",

1387
01:20:02.300 --> 01:20:03.870
I really wanted to dance.

1388
01:20:04.710 --> 01:20:06.310
In this fancy outfit,

1389
01:20:06.310 --> 01:20:07.980
I should dance to "Wa" by Lee Jung Hyun or something.

1390
01:20:08.110 --> 01:20:10.350
- But you just stood still. - Standing still in this outfit...

1391
01:20:10.350 --> 01:20:12.550
- was really hard. - To conceal his identity,

1392
01:20:12.550 --> 01:20:14.550
he had to withstand the frustration.

1393
01:20:14.550 --> 01:20:17.120
All the other members of 2AM sang on this show.

1394
01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:19.620
- Right. - We won Grand Prize with our song,

1395
01:20:19.620 --> 01:20:22.320
but our members didn't do very well on this show.

1396
01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:24.430
- That's right. - Even Chang Min was eliminated...

1397
01:20:24.430 --> 01:20:26.760
- in Round Two. - Right.

1398
01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:29.300
But I came all the way to Round Three,

1399
01:20:29.300 --> 01:20:31.670
- so I feel proud... - You must be.

1400
01:20:31.670 --> 01:20:33.030
as a leader.

1401
01:20:33.030 --> 01:20:35.440
Come to think of it, it is his 11th year...

1402
01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:38.670
this year since Jo Kwon made a debut.

1403
01:20:38.670 --> 01:20:39.980
(You're awesome.)

1404
01:20:39.980 --> 01:20:42.610
Including the time when he was a trainee, it's been almost 20 years.

1405
01:20:42.610 --> 01:20:45.510
Right. He's now in his 30s.

1406
01:20:45.510 --> 01:20:49.150
You said you wanted to be on this show at the turning point of life.

1407
01:20:49.150 --> 01:20:52.890
I tried not to be silly and frivolous anymore,

1408
01:20:52.890 --> 01:20:56.390
and wanted to sing seriously in front of people.

1409
01:20:56.390 --> 01:20:58.030
But I think it's more comfortable for me to be frivolous.

1410
01:20:58.490 --> 01:20:59.530
(You are silly and cute.)

1411
01:20:59.530 --> 01:21:01.730
I didn't know that you even had to be treated...

1412
01:21:01.730 --> 01:21:04.830
because you tried to maintain the image of being frivolous.

1413
01:21:04.830 --> 01:21:06.640
My back hurt quite a lot for a while,

1414
01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:09.170
so I went to see a doctor and found out my hips were twisted.

1415
01:21:09.940 --> 01:21:11.410
- Since I bounced my hips too much. - Because...

1416
01:21:11.410 --> 01:21:12.610
you bounced them too much.

1417
01:21:12.610 --> 01:21:14.710
I regularly get...

1418
01:21:14.710 --> 01:21:16.810
- physical therapy... - Goodness.

1419
01:21:16.810 --> 01:21:18.180
- until now. - I see.

1420
01:21:18.350 --> 01:21:21.080
When Kim Ho Young was on this show last time,

1421
01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:23.420
he said you are like his imitation.

1422
01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:25.850
Watch it. Imitation? I didn't say that.

1423
01:21:25.850 --> 01:21:27.290
You did.

1424
01:21:27.460 --> 01:21:28.990
(I'm the original version...)

1425
01:21:28.990 --> 01:21:29.990
(of Jo Kwon.)

1426
01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:32.560
(Ho Young said Kwon was the clone of him, and it created a buzz.)

1427
01:21:33.330 --> 01:21:34.500
I said he was a clone.

1428
01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:37.470
If you want to say something to his comment, I'll give you a chance.

1429
01:21:37.470 --> 01:21:39.970
He is no match for me.

1430
01:21:41.240 --> 01:21:42.840
You don't even deserve to be compared with me.

1431
01:21:43.070 --> 01:21:44.970
Then what do you want me to do?

1432
01:21:45.670 --> 01:21:46.780
(It's hilarious.)

1433
01:21:46.780 --> 01:21:49.040
Let's have a time to check out...

1434
01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:52.850
to see who is the original and who is the imitation.

1435
01:21:52.850 --> 01:21:54.720
Please come on out to the stage, Ho Young.

1436
01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:55.780
(An inevitable match between the two frivolous men)

1437
01:21:57.250 --> 01:21:59.190
Each of them insists he is the original frivolous man.

1438
01:21:59.190 --> 01:22:02.060
Music, please.

1439
01:22:03.190 --> 01:22:07.600
(Let's start the fierce competition.)

1440
01:22:09.260 --> 01:22:11.630
(Clone Jo Kwon, watch carefully.)

1441
01:22:13.740 --> 01:22:15.440
(You should move your hips this much.)

1442
01:22:16.970 --> 01:22:18.240
(Shaking amazingly)

1443
01:22:19.110 --> 01:22:21.310
(Both of them are all good.)

1444
01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:23.980
(Frivolous)

1445
01:22:24.810 --> 01:22:27.080
(Let's go again.)

1446
01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:28.650
(I'm turning.)

1447
01:22:28.650 --> 01:22:29.680
(So am I.)

1448
01:22:30.190 --> 01:22:31.690
(Can you do this?)

1449
01:22:32.220 --> 01:22:34.860
(Kwon takes the initiative and provokes Ho Young.)

1450
01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:36.990
(How dare he?)

1451
01:22:37.430 --> 01:22:39.800
(Go away.)

1452
01:22:39.930 --> 01:22:41.900
Okay. That's enough.

1453
01:22:41.900 --> 01:22:43.200
You can stop now.

1454
01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:44.200
(It was fierce until the end.)

1455
01:22:45.370 --> 01:22:46.430
Both of them are...

1456
01:22:47.100 --> 01:22:48.470
amazing. They're amazing.

1457
01:22:48.470 --> 01:22:50.970
- Both of them are winners. - They are.

1458
01:22:50.970 --> 01:22:52.840
Please give Ho Young a big hand.

1459
01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:53.880
Ho Young.

1460
01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:55.340
Thank you.

1461
01:22:55.340 --> 01:22:56.410
(We hope you two keep getting along.)

1462
01:22:57.110 --> 01:22:59.780
Now, he is flying solo.

1463
01:22:59.780 --> 01:23:02.980
He had never sung that seriously before.

1464
01:23:02.980 --> 01:23:06.350
Please give him a round of applause to cheer him up.

1465
01:23:07.390 --> 01:23:09.320
(We hope to see you more often.)

1466
01:23:11.630 --> 01:23:13.060
I feel like the burden is removed now.

1467
01:23:13.060 --> 01:23:14.130
I want to go home now.

1468
01:23:14.130 --> 01:23:15.130
(Feeling refreshed after acting funny)

1469
01:23:16.130 --> 01:23:18.000
My solo album is released in two years.

1470
01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:21.400
This show was filmed before my comeback performance.

1471
01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:24.310
I've really wanted to sing badly.

1472
01:23:24.310 --> 01:23:27.440
I was able to prove my passion for singing...

1473
01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:30.980
on this show even before my comeback show.

1474
01:23:30.980 --> 01:23:34.550
I tried my best, so even my voice became hoarse.

1475
01:23:34.550 --> 01:23:37.420
I hope many people will recognize that.

1476
01:23:37.420 --> 01:23:41.160
I wish people will find out that I try my best...

1477
01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:42.620
whatever I do...

1478
01:23:42.620 --> 01:23:44.690
and look forward to my performances.

1479
01:23:44.930 --> 01:23:47.660
Mysterious Circles was me, Jo Kwon.

1480
01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:49.630
(Please support passionate Jo Kwon.)

1481
01:23:49.630 --> 01:23:50.770
Thank you.

1482
01:23:50.970 --> 01:23:52.330
According to the result of Round Three,

1483
01:23:52.330 --> 01:23:54.600
Thank You for Your Support, Torch Man...

1484
01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:57.210
defeated Jo Kwon and moved on to Final Match.

1485
01:23:57.410 --> 01:23:59.610
The mysterious music show, King of Mask Singer.

1486
01:23:59.610 --> 01:24:03.750
Only Red Mouth's defense match is left to watch.

1487
01:24:03.750 --> 01:24:06.280
Will Red Mouth succeed in winning five consecutive times...

1488
01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:09.320
and set a new record?

1489
01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:11.620
The queen's performance...

1490
01:24:11.620 --> 01:24:14.420
of the 69th Final Match begins now.

1491
01:24:18.060 --> 01:24:20.700
The 69th Final Match.

1492
01:24:21.160 --> 01:24:23.900
There is no limit to my singing.

1493
01:24:24.230 --> 01:24:27.970
Her running toward the fifth win knows no bounds.

1494
01:24:27.970 --> 01:24:29.600
This is the 68th Queen,

1495
01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:33.980
Kiss My Lips and Love My Song, Red Mouth.

1496
01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:37.610
(With the red backlight,)

1497
01:24:39.450 --> 01:24:41.550
(Queen Red Mouth enters.)

1498
01:24:42.150 --> 01:24:43.650
(We were waiting for you.)

1499
01:24:43.790 --> 01:24:46.420
Here comes the queen.

1500
01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:48.590
I've waited for this moment for two weeks.

1501
01:24:48.890 --> 01:24:49.930
Look at her aura.

1502
01:24:49.930 --> 01:24:50.990
(The dazzling aura of the queen)

1503
01:24:50.990 --> 01:24:52.060
She looks cool.

1504
01:24:52.590 --> 01:24:54.730
(On the brink of her 5th win,)

1505
01:24:55.860 --> 01:24:58.430
(everyone here is concentrating on her.)

1506
01:24:59.030 --> 01:25:01.140
(No one has been more threatening than the current challenger.)

1507
01:25:02.270 --> 01:25:04.770
(Which song did Red Mouth choose to compete against him?)

1508
01:25:10.580 --> 01:25:13.520
(The intro starts calmly and brightly.)

1509
01:25:18.150 --> 01:25:20.620
(It's a new type of song unlike the dark ones she sang so far.)

1510
01:25:23.690 --> 01:25:29.200
("Reset" by Toy and Lee Juck)

1511
01:25:29.830 --> 01:25:31.500
("Reset" by Toy is full of hopeful messages.)

1512
01:25:32.630 --> 01:25:35.900
(Red Mouth's positive messages are starting through her song.)

1513
01:26:03.270 --> 01:26:04.330
She is good.

1514
01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:42.640
(People said she seemed to be in a trance or scary,)

1515
01:26:44.910 --> 01:26:49.210
(but her voice right now is so warm and sweet.)

1516
01:27:17.070 --> 01:27:19.470
(Red Mouth's cheering melody...)

1517
01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:22.510
(seems to be coming down from above the clouds.)

1518
01:28:37.650 --> 01:28:40.490
(She is getting more emotional as her voice becomes more powerful.)

1519
01:30:24.190 --> 01:30:28.830
(Red Mouth put her all might to sing "Reset".)

1520
01:30:30.570 --> 01:30:32.670
(It was bright unlike her other performances.)

1521
01:30:32.670 --> 01:30:34.840
She never disappoints us.

1522
01:30:35.170 --> 01:30:37.670
It had a strong impact at the end.

1523
01:30:37.870 --> 01:30:38.970
She deserves to be a queen.

1524
01:30:39.710 --> 01:30:43.110
The 69th Final Match has come to an end.

1525
01:30:43.110 --> 01:30:47.150
Hyun Chul, you seem to have a lot of thoughts in mind.

1526
01:30:47.550 --> 01:30:50.550
She's the masked queen for a reason.

1527
01:30:51.050 --> 01:30:55.120
Her ability to convey her song...

1528
01:30:55.120 --> 01:30:57.260
to about 100 people in the audience...

1529
01:30:57.260 --> 01:31:00.200
has been made possible because she's the masked queen.

1530
01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:02.260
She gained it through experience.

1531
01:31:02.260 --> 01:31:04.270
But she...

1532
01:31:04.270 --> 01:31:08.200
didn't perform for the competition here.

1533
01:31:08.200 --> 01:31:11.240
I could feel her sincerity...

1534
01:31:11.240 --> 01:31:13.710
that she wanted to sing it for us.

1535
01:31:13.710 --> 01:31:15.780
She didn't dwell on the competition.

1536
01:31:15.780 --> 01:31:18.010
And I'm sure about this.

1537
01:31:18.580 --> 01:31:21.580
Her sincerity was conveyed not only to the audience in this studio,

1538
01:31:21.580 --> 01:31:24.790
but it will be conveyed also to every single person...

1539
01:31:24.790 --> 01:31:27.560
who watches this show.

1540
01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:28.760
(She agrees.)

1541
01:31:28.790 --> 01:31:30.230
What do you think, Young Seok?

1542
01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:33.730
Red Mouth usually performs...

1543
01:31:34.260 --> 01:31:35.560
in a dark mood to be honest.

1544
01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.530
But it was exciting...

1545
01:31:39.330 --> 01:31:43.070
to see her sing a hopeful song in a crying-out way.

1546
01:31:43.340 --> 01:31:44.670
I feel this every time,

1547
01:31:44.670 --> 01:31:47.440
but the blank in between each note,

1548
01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:50.450
the off-beat that fills the blank,

1549
01:31:50.450 --> 01:31:53.620
and her desperate way of singing...

1550
01:31:54.020 --> 01:31:57.090
doubled the impact of her positive performance...

1551
01:31:57.090 --> 01:31:58.790
which was very unexpected.

1552
01:32:00.090 --> 01:32:01.160
But...

1553
01:32:02.020 --> 01:32:03.690
he's a strong opponent.

1554
01:32:03.690 --> 01:32:05.490
Torch Man isn't an easy challenger.

1555
01:32:05.490 --> 01:32:08.900
Here's what his strong point is.

1556
01:32:09.660 --> 01:32:11.100
He's fresh.

1557
01:32:11.100 --> 01:32:14.240
In the past, George Lucas topped the movie industry...

1558
01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:16.970
with his "Star Wars" series.

1559
01:32:16.970 --> 01:32:19.440
No one seemed to be able to break his movie series,

1560
01:32:19.440 --> 01:32:21.780
but Steven Spielberg's "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" did.

1561
01:32:22.710 --> 01:32:24.880
It's a famous and historical story...

1562
01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:27.350
in the movie industry.

1563
01:32:27.350 --> 01:32:32.150
Maybe the result of their competition will be similar.

1564
01:32:32.150 --> 01:32:34.460
She seems to be undefeatable,

1565
01:32:34.460 --> 01:32:37.660
but he might be able to defeat her today.

1566
01:32:37.660 --> 01:32:40.660
- Is that your opinion? - I think that's possible.

1567
01:32:40.660 --> 01:32:41.800
(Well...)

1568
01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:44.700
I asked them around a while ago.

1569
01:32:44.700 --> 01:32:46.000
I checked who picked whom.

1570
01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.100
(The exit poll on the 69th masked king competition)

1571
01:32:48.200 --> 01:32:49.940
- You asked them around? - Yes.

1572
01:32:49.940 --> 01:32:51.810
A lot of them voted for Torch Man.

1573
01:32:51.810 --> 01:32:53.810
The result doesn't seem too bright for Red Mouth.

1574
01:32:53.810 --> 01:32:56.580
- Is that right? - I voted for Red Mouth by the way.

1575
01:32:56.580 --> 01:32:58.150
- But... - A lot of them voted for him?

1576
01:32:58.150 --> 01:33:00.320
when I asked the panelists about their opinions,

1577
01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:03.450
a lot of them were expecting a new masked king.

1578
01:33:03.450 --> 01:33:05.520
- Really? - A lot of people voted for him,

1579
01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:07.390
and a few voted for her.

1580
01:33:07.390 --> 01:33:09.760
It doesn't seem to be in her favor among the panelists.

1581
01:33:09.790 --> 01:33:11.090
But the audience seems to have different opinions.

1582
01:33:11.090 --> 01:33:12.530
Because at first,

1583
01:33:12.530 --> 01:33:17.700
her performance seemed to end with a hopeful message today.

1584
01:33:17.700 --> 01:33:19.430
But it was strong at the end.

1585
01:33:19.430 --> 01:33:21.900
When you listened to the first verse,

1586
01:33:21.900 --> 01:33:24.240
- it was relaxing. - It was in a bad mood.

1587
01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:26.340
- It was like a funeral. - I see.

1588
01:33:26.340 --> 01:33:28.740
She made a last spurt at the end.

1589
01:33:28.740 --> 01:33:31.110
She caught up with Torch Man.

1590
01:33:31.110 --> 01:33:32.950
So who reached the finish line first is unpredictable.

1591
01:33:32.950 --> 01:33:36.280
- It was neck and neck. - We might need a video review.

1592
01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:38.650
They reached the finish line almost at the same time.

1593
01:33:38.650 --> 01:33:40.760
Comments about Red Mouth...

1594
01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:43.160
were about how she seemed to be possessed...

1595
01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:44.860
and how she was dark.

1596
01:33:44.860 --> 01:33:48.030
There were a lot of such comments.

1597
01:33:48.030 --> 01:33:49.560
But today,

1598
01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:52.470
she looked like a girl at a rock festival...

1599
01:33:52.470 --> 01:33:54.640
who was immersed in music...

1600
01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:57.810
and jumped around freely.

1601
01:33:57.810 --> 01:34:01.240
I saw a new side of her today.

1602
01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:07.120
I realized that her performances weren't only about possessing us.

1603
01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:10.050
I was happy to see another charm of her today.

1604
01:34:10.050 --> 01:34:12.150
- She tried out for a new thing. - That's right.

1605
01:34:12.150 --> 01:34:13.690
Singers...

1606
01:34:13.690 --> 01:34:16.730
as well as musical singers...

1607
01:34:16.730 --> 01:34:21.230
are judged by their audience and have to be chosen by them.

1608
01:34:21.230 --> 01:34:22.260
That's right.

1609
01:34:22.260 --> 01:34:25.130
I could feel her heart for her audience.

1610
01:34:25.130 --> 01:34:29.500
It made me emotional.

1611
01:34:29.500 --> 01:34:33.140
I think both of them showed their true selves today.

1612
01:34:33.140 --> 01:34:35.810
That must be why their performances felt very sincere to me.

1613
01:34:36.950 --> 01:34:39.920
Hyeok Soo, it's your first time watching this as a panelist, right?

1614
01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:41.650
- That's right. - What do you think?

1615
01:34:42.350 --> 01:34:45.590
Let me give you a restaurant example since I don't know much about music.

1616
01:34:45.590 --> 01:34:47.490
You'll compare it with a restaurant.

1617
01:34:47.690 --> 01:34:49.720
I realized for certain why people line up...

1618
01:34:50.390 --> 01:34:51.430
in front of a famous restaurant.

1619
01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:54.860
You try their food, and it's amazing.

1620
01:34:55.560 --> 01:34:57.330
You want to go again, and you crave their food.

1621
01:34:57.930 --> 01:34:59.600
That famous restaurant is like Red Mouth.

1622
01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:03.710
People will line up to listen to her voice.

1623
01:35:03.940 --> 01:35:06.140
What about Torch Man? People won't line up for him?

1624
01:35:06.140 --> 01:35:08.410
- No, think about a set menu. - A set menu?

1625
01:35:08.410 --> 01:35:10.710
You expected it'd be a set menu,

1626
01:35:10.710 --> 01:35:14.520
but it turns out to be a course meal. That's what I feel about him.

1627
01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:17.150
- His performance isn't a set menu. - There's something more.

1628
01:35:18.350 --> 01:35:20.460
You don't know what will come next.

1629
01:35:20.460 --> 01:35:23.330
You get full, but you want to eat it every time another dish is served.

1630
01:35:23.330 --> 01:35:25.290
That's the difference between them.

1631
01:35:25.390 --> 01:35:26.830
(Torch Man is like a course meal.)

1632
01:35:26.830 --> 01:35:30.900
Good. Now, let's see who's the 69th masked king.

1633
01:35:30.900 --> 01:35:33.770
I've received the result just now.

1634
01:35:33.770 --> 01:35:38.170
Will Red Mouth succeed to win five times in a row?

1635
01:35:38.170 --> 01:35:43.010
Or will Torch Man become a new masked king?

1636
01:35:43.010 --> 01:35:48.450
I'll now reveal the 69th masked king.

1637
01:35:50.490 --> 01:35:52.620
(He showed off his rhythmical voice and sang high notes with ease.)

1638
01:35:53.390 --> 01:35:54.990
(His unique voice color stood out during Round One.)

1639
01:35:56.460 --> 01:35:59.460
(Everyone fell for his charming voice.)

1640
01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:04.970
(His performance swayed the audience's hearts.)

1641
01:36:05.800 --> 01:36:07.070
(He showed his desperate emotions in Round Two.)

1642
01:36:07.740 --> 01:36:09.300
(His groove exploded.)

1643
01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:12.970
(His pleasant energy filled the entire studio.)

1644
01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:15.610
(He captured women's hearts with his unexpected charm in Round Three.)

1645
01:36:16.710 --> 01:36:21.120
(Against him was the masked queen's amazing performance.)

1646
01:36:21.850 --> 01:36:24.420
(Her distinctive energy created...)

1647
01:36:25.220 --> 01:36:28.060
(the indeterminate size of her voice volume.)

1648
01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:32.160
(She showed a relaxing performance with her deep voice color.)

1649
01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:38.730
Who's the 69th masked king selected by you?

1650
01:36:39.570 --> 01:36:42.000
The winner is...

1651
01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:43.070
(King of Mask Singer)

1652
01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:45.110
(The winner is...)

1653
01:36:45.640 --> 01:36:47.140
(It's thrilling.)

1654
01:36:47.140 --> 01:36:48.410
- The winner is... - The winner is...

1655
01:36:48.780 --> 01:36:50.280
(I won't see the result.)

1656
01:36:50.980 --> 01:36:52.310
(Who will be the only one...)

1657
01:36:52.580 --> 01:36:54.450
(to take the throne?)

1658
01:36:54.750 --> 01:36:55.820
The winner is...

1659
01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:13.290
The winner is...

1660
01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:17.940
Will there be a new king or will our masked queen take another win?

1661
01:37:18.340 --> 01:37:21.910
The winner is...

1662
01:37:22.780 --> 01:37:23.780
The winner is...

1663
01:37:26.250 --> 01:37:27.820
Red Mouth wins.

1664
01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:31.690
(She wins 5 times in a row.)

1665
01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:33.520
This is great!

1666
01:37:33.920 --> 01:37:37.160
She almost stepped down from her throne.

1667
01:37:37.590 --> 01:37:40.930
The voting difference was 53 to 46.

1668
01:37:41.530 --> 01:37:44.330
The voting difference of the panelists was 10 to 2.

1669
01:37:44.330 --> 01:37:48.200
They gave eight more votes to Torch Man.

1670
01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:54.980
But the audience gave 15 more votes to Red Mouth.

1671
01:37:54.980 --> 01:37:59.010
She became the winner with seven more votes.

1672
01:37:59.010 --> 01:38:00.450
This makes it...

1673
01:38:00.450 --> 01:38:04.790
fifth consecutive wins like Catgirl's record.

1674
01:38:04.790 --> 01:38:09.120
She places third among the masked kings and queens.

1675
01:38:09.490 --> 01:38:11.860
(Red Mouth is the 65th to 69th masked queen.)

1676
01:38:11.860 --> 01:38:17.670
Now, we'll deliver her the golden mask and the queen's robe.

1677
01:38:17.870 --> 01:38:21.000
Please say a word.

1678
01:38:21.470 --> 01:38:23.610
I'm not saying this for nothing.

1679
01:38:23.610 --> 01:38:28.110
I prepared today's performance like it was my last stage.

1680
01:38:28.110 --> 01:38:31.580
So I'm extremely surprised by the result.

1681
01:38:31.580 --> 01:38:36.550
It's as exciting as when I first became the masked queen. Thank you.

1682
01:38:38.290 --> 01:38:40.120
(Congratulations.)

1683
01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:43.430
She's the 69th masked queen with 5 consecutive wins.

1684
01:38:43.430 --> 01:38:46.360
Red Mouth will exit the stage due to security's reasons.

1685
01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:48.500
Please give her a round of applause.

1686
01:38:48.500 --> 01:38:50.470
(We'll look forward to seeing your another performance.)

1687
01:38:50.470 --> 01:38:55.400
She was the 65th, 66th, 67th, and 68th masked queen.

1688
01:38:55.400 --> 01:38:59.170
Now, she's the 69th masked queen.

1689
01:38:59.170 --> 01:39:00.240
(See you next week.)

1690
01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:05.180
She became the winner thanks to the audience's votes.

1691
01:39:05.410 --> 01:39:08.380
He was the competent challenger.

1692
01:39:08.380 --> 01:39:12.190
He almost defeated Red Mouth.

1693
01:39:12.190 --> 01:39:14.620
He's a skilled masked singer.

1694
01:39:14.620 --> 01:39:19.800
Now, Torch Man, please take off your mask and reveal your face.

1695
01:39:20.330 --> 01:39:22.500
(He can convey emotions more than anyone else.)

1696
01:39:23.070 --> 01:39:24.770
(His nasal voice is very attractive.)

1697
01:39:25.270 --> 01:39:28.040
(His way of talking and behavior are those of a middle-aged man.)

1698
01:39:28.040 --> 01:39:30.670
(What's the identity of this unpredictable, charming singer?)

1699
01:39:31.670 --> 01:39:36.750
Now, Torch Man, please take off your mask and reveal your face.

1700
01:39:37.450 --> 01:39:38.710
(This is awesome!)

1701
01:39:39.580 --> 01:39:40.620
Who is he?

1702
01:39:41.280 --> 01:39:42.380
Why? Do they know him?

1703
01:39:42.850 --> 01:39:43.920
Who is he?

1704
01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:46.290
Reveal your face.

1705
01:39:47.820 --> 01:39:48.820
He's...

1706
01:39:49.260 --> 01:39:51.160
He's the myth of climbing the music charts.

1707
01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:54.700
He's the vocalist of MeloMance, Kim Min Seok.

1708
01:39:55.860 --> 01:39:57.000
(It was Kim Min Seok, the vocalist of Melomance.)

1709
01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:58.870
- Really? - He's a member of Melomance.

1710
01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.040
Melomance.

1711
01:40:01.070 --> 01:40:02.570
I knew it.

1712
01:40:02.570 --> 01:40:04.970
That's why his voice sounded familiar.

1713
01:40:05.910 --> 01:40:08.340
(Everyone's thrilled to see him.)

1714
01:40:08.540 --> 01:40:11.480
Please say hello to the viewers.

1715
01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:15.050
Hello. I am the vocalist of Melomance, Kim Min Seok.

1716
01:40:15.050 --> 01:40:16.390
Thank you so much.

1717
01:40:16.390 --> 01:40:19.150
He's amazing.

1718
01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:22.720
(In 2015, he came to us like a gift.)

1719
01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:25.490
(He's a vocalist of male duo, Melomance.)

1720
01:40:26.090 --> 01:40:29.160
(His songs climbed up music charts.)

1721
01:40:30.170 --> 01:40:32.600
(He became famous for hitting high notes comfortably.)

1722
01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:36.200
(He gave birth to the term "Bed Singing Method".)

1723
01:40:36.870 --> 01:40:39.170
(They won Indie Musician of the Year Award.)

1724
01:40:39.610 --> 01:40:41.440
(And they established themselves as the trendy music group.)

1725
01:40:42.780 --> 01:40:45.610
(Every one of their concerts got sold out.)

1726
01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:49.850
(He is a rising star.)

1727
01:40:50.820 --> 01:40:53.860
(Kim Min Seok of Melomance has a voice to die for.)

1728
01:40:54.420 --> 01:40:58.690
The celebrity panelists are very shocked.

1729
01:40:58.690 --> 01:41:00.330
They are very surprised.

1730
01:41:00.330 --> 01:41:03.030
A lot of people in the audience seem to recognize you.

1731
01:41:03.030 --> 01:41:05.570
- Right. - Right?

1732
01:41:05.570 --> 01:41:08.600
(Do you know me? We do!)

1733
01:41:09.300 --> 01:41:11.270
In 2017, their music climbed up music charts,

1734
01:41:11.270 --> 01:41:13.840
and 2017 was like a gift to Melomance.

1735
01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:15.440
He's Kim Min Seok of Melomance.

1736
01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:17.310
Do many people recognize you now?

1737
01:41:17.310 --> 01:41:19.750
Once in every 10 days.

1738
01:41:20.750 --> 01:41:22.550
Once in every 10 days.

1739
01:41:22.550 --> 01:41:24.190
"Are you Melomance?"

1740
01:41:24.190 --> 01:41:26.490
"Aren't you him?" That's how it usually goes.

1741
01:41:26.490 --> 01:41:28.160
- Right. - That's how they recognize me.

1742
01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:30.790
After your appearance on King of Mask Singer,

1743
01:41:30.790 --> 01:41:32.730
someone will recognize you...

1744
01:41:32.730 --> 01:41:34.830
at least once a day. Will you be okay with that?

1745
01:41:34.830 --> 01:41:37.470
I will welcome them with open arms.

1746
01:41:37.470 --> 01:41:39.670
You will welcome them.

1747
01:41:40.040 --> 01:41:41.200
(I will recognize you.)

1748
01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:42.840
Min Seok has been...

1749
01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:46.580
dreaming of this stage for a long time.

1750
01:41:46.580 --> 01:41:48.580
That's what he told us. Is this true?

1751
01:41:48.580 --> 01:41:51.250
What's special about King of Mask Singer...

1752
01:41:51.250 --> 01:41:53.780
is that you sing while wearing a mask.

1753
01:41:53.780 --> 01:41:58.450
A lot of people told me I sing with a straight face.

1754
01:41:58.450 --> 01:41:59.990
- "Bed Singing Method". - Right.

1755
01:41:59.990 --> 01:42:02.420
Even when you're hitting high notes, you remain calm.

1756
01:42:02.420 --> 01:42:06.830
- Right. My aunt is a vocalist. - Right.

1757
01:42:06.830 --> 01:42:10.270
She told me I shouldn't frown when I sing...

1758
01:42:10.270 --> 01:42:12.570
to make the viewers feel comfortable.

1759
01:42:12.570 --> 01:42:14.570
She told me that because I used to frown too much.

1760
01:42:14.570 --> 01:42:17.440
So now I look too stiff.

1761
01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:19.910
I was curious to see how well...

1762
01:42:19.910 --> 01:42:24.550
I could convey my emotions with my face covered.

1763
01:42:24.550 --> 01:42:28.950
I think it was very successful.

1764
01:42:28.950 --> 01:42:31.590
Right. The celebrity panelists...

1765
01:42:31.590 --> 01:42:34.120
all voted for you,

1766
01:42:34.120 --> 01:42:36.160
so they are still shocked.

1767
01:42:36.160 --> 01:42:38.660
The fact that we all voted for him...

1768
01:42:38.660 --> 01:42:41.030
without knowing who he is proves that he's truly great.

1769
01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:44.470
We've seen so many talented singers.

1770
01:42:44.470 --> 01:42:46.770
And yet almost everyone voted for him.

1771
01:42:46.770 --> 01:42:48.800
That means he deserves to represent our country...

1772
01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:49.910
as one of our greatest singers.

1773
01:42:49.910 --> 01:42:51.970
- That's how talented he is. - This is true.

1774
01:42:51.970 --> 01:42:54.580
- That's what I would say. - He fought against the queen.

1775
01:42:54.580 --> 01:42:56.380
Right. He didn't fall behind at all.

1776
01:42:56.380 --> 01:43:00.050
Yes. Gu Ra, can you say something before he leaves the stage?

1777
01:43:00.050 --> 01:43:01.880
- I did my research. - Right.

1778
01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:04.950
Dong Hwan plays the piano.

1779
01:43:04.950 --> 01:43:07.360
- They're a duo. Melomance. - Right.

1780
01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:09.660
That's all I found out.

1781
01:43:09.660 --> 01:43:10.960
- You didn't find a lot. - I...

1782
01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:13.060
I asked him what the song "Gift" is like.

1783
01:43:13.060 --> 01:43:14.830
And he sang it for me.

1784
01:43:14.830 --> 01:43:19.770
Then I recognized it. We hear it everywhere.

1785
01:43:19.770 --> 01:43:23.370
I loved his performance. He's very funny.

1786
01:43:23.370 --> 01:43:27.380
I think he would do well on variety shows too.

1787
01:43:27.380 --> 01:43:30.280
I think I will see him on other shows and hear more of his music.

1788
01:43:30.280 --> 01:43:31.680
- Yes. - All right.

1789
01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:35.580
Singing sincerely, he communed with the audience...

1790
01:43:35.580 --> 01:43:38.220
and gave a special performance. Please give it up once again...

1791
01:43:38.220 --> 01:43:41.320
for Min Seok.

1792
01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:45.860
(Please let us hear more of your sweet voice.)

1793
01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:50.100
On King of Mask Singer, I danced,

1794
01:43:50.100 --> 01:43:52.870
and I practiced impersonating people for the first time.

1795
01:43:52.870 --> 01:43:56.970
That was new and exciting experience.

1796
01:43:56.970 --> 01:43:59.670
Final Match was amazing.

1797
01:43:59.670 --> 01:44:01.740
The queen was so good...

1798
01:44:01.740 --> 01:44:05.550
that I have no objection to the result.

1799
01:44:05.550 --> 01:44:07.820
I did my best too.

1800
01:44:07.820 --> 01:44:10.250
I feel happy that I have no regrets.

1801
01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:13.960
You are like

1802
01:44:14.060 --> 01:44:16.930
A gift exclusively prepared for me

1803
01:44:16.930 --> 01:44:20.030
Small

1804
01:44:20.030 --> 01:44:22.800
(He will try hard to pay back for the big love he received.)

1805
01:44:23.230 --> 01:44:27.240
Everyone. The masked singer you loved, Torch Man,

1806
01:44:27.240 --> 01:44:30.270
is me. Kim Min Seok. Thank you.

1807
01:44:30.270 --> 01:44:31.270
(Thank you.)

1808
01:44:31.270 --> 01:44:32.270
Bye.

1809
01:44:32.270 --> 01:44:34.380
(Shortly, "Wizard of Nowhere" will be aired.)

1810
01:44:34.380 --> 01:44:35.810
Next week.

1811
01:44:36.110 --> 01:44:37.880
(Ambitious contestants...)

1812
01:44:38.350 --> 01:44:41.450
(come to stop the queen.)

1813
01:44:42.450 --> 01:44:44.920
(They are determined to go to Final Match.)

1814
01:44:45.790 --> 01:44:46.960
(Let's go!)

1815
01:44:47.590 --> 01:44:50.430
(With touching performances, they will shake the world.)

1816
01:44:50.630 --> 01:44:53.330
(Their unbelievable talent makes the panelists refuse to judge.)

1817
01:44:53.560 --> 01:44:55.700
(Someone will win with just 1 more vote.)

1818
01:44:56.260 --> 01:44:58.200
(The intense match will be revealed next week.)
